Title:Outcomes of swallowing rehabilitation in chronic brainstem dysphagia: A retrospective evaluation.
Authors:['Huckabee ML', 'Cannito MP']
Affiliation:School of Audiology and Speech Language Pathology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:This study examines the functional and physiologic outcomes of treatment in a group of 10 patients with chronic dysphagia subsequent to a single brainstem injury. All patients participated in a structured swallowing treatment program at a metropolitan teaching hospital. This program differs from more traditional swallowing treatment by the inclusion of surface electromyography biofeedback as a treatment modality and the completion of 10 hr of direct treatment in the first week of intervention. A retrospective analysis of medical records and patient questionnaires was used to gain information regarding medical history, site of lesion, prior interventions, and patient perception of swallowing recovery. Physiologic change in swallowing treatment, as measured by severity ratings of videofluoroscopic swallowing studies, was demonstrated in nine of 10 patients after 1 week or 10 sessions of treatment. Functional change was measured by diet level tolerance after 1 week of treatment, at 6 months, and again at 1 year posttreatment. Eight of the 10 patients were able to return to full oral intake with termination of gastrostomy tube feedings, whereas two demonstrated no long-term change in functional swallowing. Of the eight who returned to full oral intake, the average duration of tube feedings following treatment until discontinuation was 5.3 months, with a range of 1-12 months. Six patients who returned to oral intake maintained gains in swallowing function, and two patients returned to nonoral nutrition as the result of a new unrelated medical condition.

Title:Contact stress at articular surfaces in total joint replacements. Part II: Analytical and numerical methods.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 3815-6576, USA.
Abstract:In this second part of the series of reviews, attention focuses on analytical and numerical methods that have been used to estimate the magnitude of the contact stress in: models of articular joints; models of total joint replacements, without and with the associated joint; or models of simple physical systems that are deemed to have relevance to conditions at articular surfaces in arthroplasties. Three main recommendations emerge from this review. First, analytical methods should be avoided. Second, for numerical studies, the nonlinear contact finite element method should be used. Third, more work is needed in many areas, an example of which is the effect of the method of sterilization of tibial inserts on the estimated contact stress at the tibiofemoral interface in knee implants.

Title:A methodology for examining the plausibility of accelerated aging protocols for UHMWPE components.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Nyman JS', 'Trieu HH']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152-6576, USA.
Abstract:In light of the time-intensive nature of using real-time shelf-aged specimens in research into property changes of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), accelerated thermal diffusion oxidative aging (usually referred to as accelerated aging) is frequently resorted to. A number of such aging protocols have been reported in the literature, with various claims for their producing changes in the properties of the polymer being the same as or similar to those seen in real-time shelf-aged samples. The thrust of the present work is the presentation of a methodology for examining such claims. The methodology is applied to six properties (% crystallinity, melting temperature, oxidation index, ultimate tensile strength, ultimate tensile elongation, and tensile toughness) of 4150HP UHMWPE grade, sterilized using six different methods, prior to and following the use of a specific accelerated aging protocol (oxygen gas at 70 degrees C and 507 kPa pressure; 14 d.). These six properties have been identified in the literature as being strongly correlated with the clinical wear of UHMWPE articular components. It is shown that the claim for the protocol used in the present work (in terms of the simulated equivalent shelf aging time) is plausible. It needs to be emphasized, however, that this conclusion is tentative given the paucity of the relevant literature results that are currently available and which are vital to the application of the methodology.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To identify the sources used by young adolescents to obtain cigarettes. DESIGN: In early 1994 a survey assessing usual sources of cigarettes and characteristics of the respondents was administered in homeroom classes. SETTING: A large urban, predominantly African American school system. SUBJECTS: A population-based sample of 6967 seventh graders averaging 13 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Reports of usual sources of cigarettes. RESULTS: At this age level, young smokers were more likely to get cigarettes from friends (31.2%) than buy them in stores (14.3%). However, the odds of purchasing varied for different groups of children. Regular smokers were much more likely (48.3%) to have purchased cigarettes than experimental smokers (9.6%), p < 0.001. Girls were less likely to have bought their cigarettes than boys (p < 0.001), and black smokers were less likely to have purchased cigarettes than white children (p < 0.001). Results suggested that family members who smoke may constitute a more important source of tobacco products than previously recognised, particularly for young girls. CONCLUSIONS: In this middle-school sample, peers provided the major point of cigarette distribution. However, even at this age, direct purchase was not uncommon. Sources of cigarettes varied significantly with gender, ethnicity, and smoking rate.

Title:Reactions of beginning counselors to situations involving death and dying.
Authors:['Kirchberg TM', 'Neimeyer RA']
Affiliation:Memphis State University.
Abstract:It has commonly been assumed by thanatologists that client problems centering on death and dying are particularly demanding and difficult for the mental health professional. The present study tested this assumption by asking 81 beginning counselors to rate their degree of comfort with 15 counseling scenarios, 5 of which involved death or loss (e.g., terminal illness, suicide, AIDS, grief) and 10 of which concerned other focal issues (e.g., rape, marital problems). As predicted, counselors rated situations involving death and dying as substantially more uncomfortable than other presenting problems. However, counselors' levels of experience and personal death threat were unrelated to their response to death situations, leaving the cause of their discomfort with such situations unexplained.

Title:Rural health care issues in the Lower Mississippi Delta: an agenda for the year 2000.
Authors:['Hawkins WF', 'Hyland SE']
Affiliation:Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission, Memphis, TN 38119.
Abstract:The 214 counties bordering both sides of the Lower Mississippi Delta from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to New Orleans, Louisiana, currently represent one of the four major poverty regions in the United States. Despite the location of five major medical centers, the Lower Mississippi Delta continues to lag behind the rest of the country in important health indices. This paper presents comparative data on infant mortality rates and health care availability between the Lower Mississippi Delta and the rest of the nation. It also contains comparative data on the rural Lower Mississippi Delta and the rest of the rural U.S. Further comparisons of European and African-American infant mortality rates reveal necessary directions and important realities for future health efforts. Commission research, gathered in public hearings from the Delta, reveals a pattern of interrelated development factors that also seriously affect health care in rural Delta counties.

Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:The present project investigated the relationship between death fear and threat, attitudes toward the elderly, and personal anxiety toward one's own aging in a group of 145 nursing home employees and a matched comparison group of 130 individuals who worked in non-death related occupations. Contrary to predictions, nursing home personnel did not have higher levels of death threat when compared to controls; in fact, control group subjects had higher levels of death concern on two dimensions of death fear (fear of the dead and fear of significant others dying). However, the results also indicated that increasing levels of death concern were associated with greater anxiety toward aging, especially in the nursing home sample, and nursing personnel displayed significantly fewer positive attitudes toward the elderly than did controls.

Title:Evaluation of suicide intervention effectiveness.
Authors:['Neimeyer RA', 'Pfeiffer AM']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Considering the prevalence of suicide and other forms of self-injurious behavior, it is ironic that relatively little attention has been paid to the training of mental health workers in suicide intervention. Still less effort has been spent in evaluating the effectiveness of such workers or the agencies in which they serve. We review the evaluation strategies that have been used to assess the process and outcome of suicide intervention, ranging from macroanalyses of the impact of crisis services on suicide rates in the community to microanalyses of the competence of individual suicide interventionists. Particular attention is paid to the Suicide Intervention Response Inventory, a self-administered test of suicide counseling skills whose validity, reliability, and practical utility suggest the benefit of its use in a broader range of research and applied settings. The advantages and disadvantages of each evaluation strategy are discussed, and guidelines are offered for the sophistication of future research and program evaluation efforts.

Title:Electrochemical behavior of Ti-6Al-4V alloy in static biosimulating solutions.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Daigle K']

Abstract:The static general corrosion behavior of Ti-6Al-4V alloy specimens in three lactated Ringer's-based solutions was investigated using d.c. potentiodynamic, d.c. linear polarization resistance, and a.c. impedance techniques. A critical appraisal of the use of these techniques for the estimation of the corrosion rate of the material is presented. Whence it was shown that the presence of bovine serum in or decreasing the pH level of (to about 1) lactated Ringer's solution leads to an increase in the corrosion rate of the alloy (relative to that in lactated Ringer's solution, pH 6.25).

Title:Finite element stress analysis of the wrist joint without and with an endoprosthesis.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Vannappagari SR']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The finite element analysis method was used to obtain the lateral deformation profile and values of the von Mises stress in the cortical and cancellous regions of the various bones in models of a selected space in the coronal plane of a human wrist joint, without and with a prosthesis. The prosthesis was the metacarpal component of the Trispherical design of the total wrist joint arthroplasty. The models included all the bones, the associated network of ligaments, and the intervening soft muscle tissue. Each type of model was completely constrained along its entire proximal surface and subjected to either a static point force (in the axial compressive or anteroposterior tensile direction) acting at the center of the distal tip of the third metacarpal cortical bone. For the models containing the prosthesis, a parametric study was conducted involving the method of anchorage of the prosthesis to the contiguous bones and the material of fabrication of the prosthesis. It was found that: (1) the axial force produces lower stresses in the bones compared with the anteroposterior one; (2) no clear-cut case can be advanced, from the stress viewpoint, for press-fitting the prosthesis to the contiguous bones rather than using bone cement for such anchorage; and (3) any alloy with modulus of elasticity in the 79 to 196 GPa range and Poisson's ratio of about 0.3 may be used to fabricate the prosthesis. The approximations used and the associated limitations of the work are fully discussed, as are the design implications and clinical significance of the results.

Title:The total wrist joint arthroplasty: biomechanical considerations and research directions.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:A review of the state-of-the-art knowledge base on the biomechanics of the wrist joint, with emphasis on total wrist joint arthroplasty, is presented. The reasons for the reported high rate of aseptic loosening of the metacarpal component of such an implant are unknown at this time. It is suggested that detailed stress analyses of models of the joint, without and with the aforementioned implant, will yield results that will increase understanding of this problem and improve implant design, resulting in enhanced clinical performance of these replacements. For this purpose, it is recommended that the finite element analysis method be used.

Title:The Suicide Intervention Response Inventory: a revision and validation.
Authors:['Neimeyer RA', 'Bonnelle K']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:The Suicide Intervention Response Inventory (SIRI) was developed by Neimeyer and MacInnes (1981) to assess the ability of paraprofessional counselors to recognize appropriate responses to suicidal clients. Although several studies have supported the validity of the scale, concerns have been raised about its ceiling effect when administered to more highly trained counselors. Psychometric improvements were therefore attempted, and the original dichotomous scoring system was replaced with a Likert scale format, in the SIRI-2. Because respondents were required to make more subtle judgments concerning the appropriateness of each response as defined by a criterion group of highly expert suicidologists, the ceiling effect that limited the use of the original measure was eliminated. Construct and discriminant validity were demonstrated in both versions of the instrument. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability showed improvement with the SIRI-2. Overall, the SIRI-2 shows promise as an index of suicide counseling effectiveness, especially among more skilled counselors.

Title:Beginning counselors' death concerns and empathic responses to client situations involving death and grief.
Authors:['Kirchberg TM', 'Neimeyer RA', 'James RK']
Affiliation:VA Medical Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:Beginning counselors' levels of discomfort and ability to respond empathically to clients presenting with death-related issues was investigated. Fifty-eight masters-level counseling students completed the Threat Index and the Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale and viewed a series of 8 videotape vignettes depicting clients with death-related (e.g., grief, AIDS) and non-death-related problems (e.g., marital discord, physical handicap). As hypothesized, significantly higher levels of counselor discomfort were found in responding to client situations involving death and dying, especially when these involved serious illness in the client. In addition, personal fear of death predicted counselors' distress in death counseling. Contrary to expectations, counselors were actually slightly more empathic in responding to grief and loss than other conditions, although the overall level of empathy displayed was low in absolute terms. The least empathic responses were provided by counselors who construed death in fatalistic terms on the Threat Index, and who were "saturated" with death themes by the completion of death attitude questionnaires prior to viewing the videos. The authors concluded that death and loss counseling presents unique challenges to beginning mental health providers, especially for those whose personal death anxieties leave them vulnerable to such work.

Title:Some state space models of HIV pathogenesis under treatment by anti-viral drugs in HIV-infected individuals.
Authors:['Tan WY', 'Xiang Z']
Affiliation:Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA. tanwy@msci.memphis.edu
Abstract:In this paper we have extended the model of HIV pathogenesis under treatment by anti-viral drugs given by Perelson et al. [A.S. Perelson et al., Science 271 (1999) 1582] to a stochastic model. By using this stochastic model as the stochastic system model, we have developed a state space model for the HIV pathogenesis under treatment by anti-viral drugs. In this state space model, the observation model is a statistical model based on the observed numbers of RNA virus copies over different times. For this model we have developed procedures for estimating and predicting the numbers of infectious free HIV and non-infectious free HIV as well as the numbers of different types of T cells through extended Kalman filter method. As an illustration, we have applied the method of this paper to the data of patient Nos. 104, 105 and 107 given by Perelson et al. [A.S. Perelson et al., Science 271 (1999) 1582] under treatment by Ritonavir. For these individuals, it is shown that within two weeks since treatment, most of the free HIV are non-infectious, indicating the usefulness of the treatment. Furthermore, the Kalman filter method revealed a much stronger effect of the treatment within the first 10 to 20 h than that predicted by the deterministic model.

Title:The febrile response to lipopolysaccharide is blocked in cyclooxygenase-2(-/-), but not in cyclooxygenase-1(-/-) mice.

Abstract:Various lines of evidence have implicated inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in fever production. Thus, its expression is selectively enhanced in brain after peripheral exogenous (e.g., lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) or endogenous (e.g., interleukin-1) pyrogen administration, while selective COX-2 inhibitors suppress the fever induced by these pyrogens. In this study, we assessed the febrile response to LPS of congenitally constitutive COX-1 (COX-1-/-) and COX-2 (COX-2-/-)-deficient C57BL/6J-derived mice. COX-1+/- and COX-2+/- mice were also evaluated; controls were wild-type C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs.). All the animals were pretrained daily for two weeks to the experimental procedures. LPS was injected intraperitoneally at 1 microgram/mouse; pyrogen-free saline (PFS) was the vehicle and control solution. Core temperatures (Tcs) were recorded using thermocouples inserted 2 cm into the colon. The presence of the COX isoforms was determined in cerebral blood vessels immunocytochemically after the experiments, without knowledge of the functional results. The data showed that the wild-type, COX-1+/-, and COX-1-/- mice all responded to LPS with a 1 degrees C rise in Tc within 1 h; the fever gradually abated over the next 4 h. By contrast, COX-2+/- and COX-2-/- mice displayed no Tc rise after LPS. PFS did not affect the Tc of any animal. It would appear therefore that COX-2 is necessary for LPS-induced fever production.

Title:Serum opacity factor is a major fibronectin-binding protein and a virulence determinant of M type 2 Streptococcus pyogenes.

Abstract:Serum opacity factor (SOF) is a fibronectin-binding protein of group A streptococci that opacifies mammalian sera and is expressed by some strains that cause impetigo, pharyngitis and acute glomerulonephritis. Although SOF is expressed by approximately 35% of known serotypes, its role in the pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections has not been previously investigated. The sof genes from M types 2, 28 and 49 Streptococcus pyogenes were cloned, sequenced, and their deduced amino acid sequences were compared. The gene for FnBA, a fibronectin-binding protein from Streptococcus dysgalactiae, was also cloned and found to express an opacity factor. The leader sequences, the fibronectin-binding domains, and the membrane anchor regions of these proteins were highly conserved. Short spans of conserved sequences were interspersed throughout the remaining parts of the proteins. The sof2 gene was insertionally inactivated in an M type 2 S. pyogenes strain, T2MR. The resultant SOF-negative mutant (YL3) did not express SOF or opacify serum, and exhibited a 71% reduction in binding fibronectin. Complementation of the SOF-negative defect with sof28 in the recombinant strain YL3(pNZ28) fully restored fibronectin-binding activity and the ability to opacify serum. To determine whether sof plays a role in virulence, mice were challenged intraperitoneally with these strains. None of the 10 mice infected with YL3(pNZ28) survived and only 1 out of 15 mice challenged with T2MR survived, whereas 12 out of 15 mice infected with YL3 survived. These data clearly indicate that SOF is a virulence factor, and they provide the first direct evidence that a fibronectin-binding protein contributes to the pathogenesis of group A streptococcal infections in vivo.

Title:Specific binding of human interferon-gamma to particulates from hemolymph and protocerebrum of tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) larvae.
Authors:['Parker MS', 'Ourth DD']
Affiliation:Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Specific binding sites for human interferon-gamma (hIFN-gamma) were found on particulates prepared from the hemolymph and protocerebrum of fifth-instar larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. A portion of these sites could be solubilized in an active form by the zwitterionic detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS). A well-defined specific binding was also associated with hemolymph particulate residue after solubilization by CHAPS. About one-half of [125I]hIFN-gamma binding could be displaced by heparin. The bound hIFN-gamma could be covalently cross-linked to the binding sites using disuccinylamide suberate, and the molecular weight range of these complexes was 200-800 kDa as determined by density gradient sedimentation and gel-exclusion chromatography. Only a small fraction of the hemolymph IFN-gamma binding could be competed by another mammalian cytokine, rat prolactin (rPRL), while there was no sensitivity to rat growth hormone. The small specific rPRL binding found in Manduca hemolymph showed an affinity similar to the prolactin sites found in the liver of pregnant rats. The detergent-insoluble Manduca hIFN-gamma binding was bimodal and similar in affinity distribution to the binding found with human platelet membranes (Kdiss range 0.1-2 nM). The detergent-solubilized IFN-gamma sites were homogenous, with a Kdiss of about 1.5 nM. The IFN-gamma binding sites in Manduca tissues may therefore include molecular species similar to the known invertebrate cytokine receptors and proteoglycan co-receptors.

Title:Iron(III)-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry for the purification and characterization of synthetic phosphopeptides.
Authors:['Li S', 'Dass C']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:A method based upon immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) is described for purification of phosphopeptides from the crude preparations of solid-phase peptide synthesis step. Affinity chromatography consists of iron(III) immobilized on iminodiacetate-agarose gel. The method was applied for purification of seven synthetic enkephalin-related phosphorylated peptides. The effectiveness of the method was evaluated by analyzing the IMAC-retained and -nonretained components using reversed-phase (RP) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and an on-line combination of RP-HPLC and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The UV and total ion current chromatograms demonstrated that the phosphopeptides were effectively separated and purified.

Title:Effect of mixing method and storage temperature of cement constituents on the fatigue and porosity of acrylic bone cement.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:The influence of the storage temperature of the cement constituents prior to mixing (21 vs. 4 degrees C) and the mixing method (hand mixing vs. vacuum mixing) on the uniaxial tension-compression fatigue performance and porosity of Palacos R acrylic bone cement was studied. The fatigue results were analyzed using the three-parameter Weibull equation. The fatigue performance was expressed as an index I, which was defined as the product of the Weibull characteristic fatigue life and the square root of the Weibull slope. Statistical analyses of these results show that although the mixing method (for a given storage temperature) exerts a significant influence on the fatigue performance and areal porosity, the effect of storage temperature (for a given mixing method) on either of these parameters is not significant.

Title:Biomechanics as a basis for management of intra-articular fractures of the calcaneus.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:This article presents a critical examination of biomechanics studies in the literature that could shed light on or contribute to the development of methods of managing intra-articular calcaneal fractures. An appreciation and understanding of such studies is predicated on a sound knowledge of a number of germane topics: the anatomy of the normal calcaneus, the pathomechanics of the calcaneus, fracture-classification schemes, and fracture-management methods. The first part of this review presents overviews of these topics. The biomechanics studies are then reviewed in detail. The article concludes with a description of research areas that might close the gaps identified in these studies.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to survey an entire population of Air Force recruits (N = 32,144) regarding milk consumption and demographic and health-related factors that may predict milk consumption. DESIGN: All subjects were required to fill out a 53-item health survey at the start of basic military training. SUBJECTS/SETTING: All recruits who entered the US Air Force from August 1995 to August 1996 participated in this study (N = 32,144). STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Potential correlates of milk intake were analyzed using Spearman rank order correlations and multiple linear regression. Variables were removed if they did not make a meaningful contribution to variance in milk intake. Because of skewed distributions, several variables were dichotomized (e.g., age: 17 to 24 vs 25 to 35 years). RESULTS: In terms of milk consumption, 51.7% of the respondents reported intake of fewer than 1 serving per day; only 17.9% reported intake of 3 servings or more per day. Milk intake was positively associated with body weight and fruit/vegetable intake and negatively associated with age, education level, reported milk-related gastric distress, physical activity level, dieting frequency, and concern about weight. Gender (women reported lower intake) and ethnicity (minorities reported lower intake) were independently related to milk consumption. Of all respondents, 16.1% reported themselves to have milk-related gastric distress, but rates varied depending on age, gender, and ethnicity (ranging from 10.2% for younger non-Hispanic white men to 60.4% for older Asian men). APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Despite the efforts of large, costly campaigns designed to increase milk consumption, self-reported milk consumption in young adults is extremely low. Given the importance of dairy products as a major source of calcium in the American diet, dietetics practitioners should assess milk consumption among young adults to ensure sufficient calcium intake to maximize peak bone mass in this group.

Title:Disabled-1 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of amyloid precursor-like protein 1.
Authors:['Homayouni R', 'Rice DS', 'Sheldon M', 'Curran T']
Affiliation:Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.
Abstract:Disruption of the disabled-1 gene (Dab1) results in aberrant migration of neurons during development and disorganization of laminar structures throughout the brain. Dab1 is thought to function as an adapter molecule in signal transduction processes. It contains a protein-interaction (PI) domain similar to the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of the Shc oncoprotein, it is phosphorylated by the Src protein tyrosine kinase, and it binds to SH2 domains in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. To investigate the function of Dab1, we searched for binding proteins using the yeast two-hybrid system. We found that the PI domain of Dab1 interacts with the amyloid precursor-like protein 1 (APLP1). The association of Dab1 with APLP1 was confirmed in biochemical assays, and the site of interaction was localized to a cytoplasmic region of APLP1 containing the amino acid sequence motif Asn-Pro-x-Tyr (NPxY). NPxY motifs are involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and they have been shown to bind to PI domains present in several proteins. This region of APLP1 is conserved among all members of the amyloid precursor family of proteins. Indeed, we found that Dab1 also interacts with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and APLP2 in biochemical association experiments. In transiently transfected cells, Dab1 and APLP1 colocalized in membrane ruffles and vesicular structures. Cotransfection assays in cultured cells indicated that APP family members increased serine phosphorylation of Dab1. Dab1 and APLP1 are expressed in similar cell populations in developing and adult brain tissue. These results suggest that Dab1 may function, at least in part, through association with APLP1 in the brain.

Title:Measuring Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life: the SADL scale.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To develop a self-report inventory to quantify satisfaction with hearing aids. DESIGN: The inventory was developed in several stages. To determine the elements that are most important to satisfaction for most people, we conducted structured interviews and then designed a questionnaire. Hearing aid owners responded to the questionnaire, indicating the relative importance of 14 different elements in their hearing aid satisfaction. Analyses indicated that the elements could be placed into four importance content areas. Trial satisfaction items were designed for each content area and submitted to focus groups to identify highly salient items as well as ambiguous items. A 25-item satisfaction questionnaire then was developed and disseminated to hearing aid owners. Results were obtained from 257 individuals. These data were analyzed to generate the final questionnaire. RESULTS: Fifteen items, divided into four subscales, were selected for the final Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) questionnaire. The questionnaire yields a Global satisfaction score and a profile of subscale scores, which address Positive Effects, Service and Cost, Negative Features, and Personal Image. A preliminary evaluation of retest stability was conducted with 104 subjects. Ninety percent critical differences for the various scores ranged from 0.9 to 2.0 score intervals on a 7 point scale. CONCLUSIONS: The SADL scale is both brief enough to be clinically acceptable and comprehensive enough to provide a valid assessment of an inherently multidimensional variable. Additional assessment is necessary to refine understanding of its test-retest properties, explore validity issues, and determine clinical, research, and administrative applications of the data.

Abstract:Expansion of early lymphoid progenitors requires interleukin-7 (IL-7), which functions through gamma(c)-mediated receptor activation of Jak3. Jak3 deficiency is a cause of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in humans and mice. IL-3 activates many of the same signaling pathways as IL-7, such as Stat5, but achieves this effect through the activation of Jak2 rather than Jak3. We hypothesized that expansion of an IL-7-responsive precursor population through a Jak3-independent pathway using IL-3 may stimulate early lymphoid progenitors and restore lymphopoiesis in Jak3(-/-) mice. Newborn Jak3(-/-) mice that were injected with IL-3 demonstrated thymic enlargement, a 2- to 20-fold increase in thymocyte numbers, and up to a 10-fold expansion in the number of CD4(+), CD8(+), and B220(+)/IgM(+) splenic lymphocytes, consistent with an effect upon an early lymphoid progenitor population. In contrast to control mice, IL-3-treated Jak3(-/-) mice challenged with the allogeneic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-bearing tumor P815 developed a specific CD8-dependent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. IL-3-treated mice also mounted influenza-specific CTL responses and survival was prolonged. The beneficial effects of IL-3 are proposed to be produced by stimulation of a lymphoid precursor population of IL-7Ralpha(+)/IL-3Ralpha(+) cells that we identified in wild-type bone marrow. In vitro, we show that an early IL-7R(+) lymphoid progenitor population expresses IL-3R and proliferates in response to IL-3 and that IL-3 activates Stat5 comparably to IL-7. Clinically, IL-3 may therefore be useful treatment for X-linked and Jak3-deficient SCID patients who lack bone marrow donors.

Title:Relationship of auditory middle latency response and stem-word completion test as indicators of implicit memory formation during general anesthesia.
Authors:['Smith TL', 'Zapala D', 'Thompson CL', 'Hoye W', 'Kelly T']
Affiliation:University of Tennessee, Memphis, USA.
Abstract:Anesthesia providers are unable to objectively evaluate the amnesic status of an anesthetized patient. One purpose of the study was to evaluate the anesthetized patient's ability to process auditory information while receiving an inhalational or intravenous anesthetic regimen. The other purpose was to examine the relationship of the Pa latency of the auditory middle latency response (AMLR) with the stem-word completion test as an intraoperative indicator of implicit memory formation during general anesthesia. One hundred one adults were randomly assigned in a single-blinded design to either a midazolam or sevoflurane anesthetic regimen. Midazolam was administered at 0.540 microgram/kg per minute with fentanyl and 50% nitrous oxide. The other anesthetic regimen was 1.4% end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane with fentanyl and 50% nitrous oxide. A list of 10 words was repeated 16 times. AMLRs were recorded intraoperatively. The difference between the midazolam groups borderlined statistical significance (P = .07) in illustrating that one may potentially process auditory information while anesthetized. Dissimilar findings were found between the sevoflurane groups (P = .77). An inverse correlation was demonstrated between the midazolam group and Pa latency of the AMLR (r = -0.40, P = .047). Multiple regression of the midazolam group demonstrated that the employment status (r2 = .297, P = .005) and the Pa latency (r2 = .238, P = .003) were the best predictors of the postoperative stem-word completion test (F = 12.61, P = .001). In contrast, no correlation was noted in the sevoflurane group (r = 0.43, P = .07). Thus, the continued evaluation of the AMLR as an intraoperative indicator of implicit memory formation is warranted. With the establishment of the AMLR as an indicator of implicit memory formation during general anesthesia, anesthesia providers could then address the occurrences of traumatic neurosis in the postoperative surgical patient and strive to avoid the medicolegal concerns that may face the healthcare team.

Title:The effect of N-terminal acetylation and the inhibition activity of acetylated enkephalins on the aminopeptidase M-catalyzed hydrolysis of enkephalins.
Authors:['Jayawardene DS', 'Dass C']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:High performance liquid chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry were used to study the effect of N-terminal acetylation and the inhibition activity of acetylated enkephalins on the aminopeptidase M (EC 3.4.11.2)-catalyzed hydrolysis of methionine (Met-enk) and leucine enkephalins (Leu-enk). Acetylation imparts a significant enhancement in the proteolytic stability of these two peptides. After 30 min of the reaction, < 10% of both acetylated enkephalins was hydrolyzed. In an 8-h incubation period, only a maximum of 54% acetylated (Ac)-Met-enk and 38% Ac-Leu-enk was hydrolyzed. Vmax and Km [infil] for the degradation of Ac-Met-enk were 1.4 nmol/min/50 ng and 2.2 mM, respectively. The corresponding values for the reaction of Ac-Leu-enk were 0.5 nmol/min/50 ng and 0.9 mM. Also, the aminopeptidase M activity on Met-enk can be inhibited in the presence of Ac-Met-enk, which acts as a mixed-type inhibitor with the inhibition constant (K(i)) of I x 10(-3) M.

Title:Effects of hippocampal damage on reward threshold and response rate during self-stimulation of the ventral tegmental area in the rat.
Authors:['Kelley SP', 'Mittleman G']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Psychology Department, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The main purpose of this study was to explore the role of the hippocampus in motivated behavior. Rats with bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampus and controls were trained to lever press for electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area. Rate intensity functions were generated from an ascending and descending series of current intensities. Lesion-induced changes in sensitivity to reward were distinguished from enhancements in motor output by calculating reward thresholds and maximal response rates from the rate-intensity functions. Rats with hippocampal damage showed lower reward thresholds and higher maximal response rates than controls. These results provide further evidence of hippocampal modulation of the nucleus accumbens, suggesting that lesions of this structure enhance sensitivity to reward and increase motor output.

Abstract:A signaling pathway involving the extracellular protein Reelin and the intracellular adaptor protein Disabled-1 (Dab1) controls cell positioning during mammalian brain development. Here, we demonstrate that Reelin binds directly to lipoprotein receptors, preferably the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2). Binding requires calcium, and it is inhibited in the presence of apoE. Furthermore, the CR-50 monoclonal antibody, which inhibits Reelin function, blocks the association of Reelin with VLDLR. After binding to VLDLR on the cell surface, Reelin is internalized into vesicles. In dissociated neurons, apoE reduces the level of Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1. These data suggest that Reelin directs neuronal migration by binding to VLDLR and ApoER2.

Title:Synergy of topotecan in combination with vincristine for treatment of pediatric solid tumor xenografts.

Abstract:Topotecan and vincristine were evaluated alone or in combination against 13 independent xenografts and 1 vincristine-resistant derivative, representing childhood neuroblastoma (n = 6), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 5), or brain tumors (n = 3). Topotecan was given by i.v. bolus on a schedule found previously to be optimal. Drug was administered daily for 5 days on 2 consecutive weeks with cycles repeated every 21 days over a period of 8 weeks. Doses of topotecan ranged from 0.16 to 1.5 mg/kg to simulate clinically achievable topotecan lactone plasma systemic exposures. Vincristine was administered i.v. every 7 days at a fixed dose of 1 mg/kg. Given as a single agent, vincristine induced complete responses (CRs) in all mice bearing two rhabdomyosarcomas (Rh28 and Rh30) and some CRs in Rh12-bearing mice (57%) but relatively few CRs (<29%) in other tumors. As a single agent, topotecan induced CR in a low proportion of tumor lines. A dose-response model with a logit link function was used to investigate whether the combination of topotecan and vincristine resulted in greater than expected responses compared with the activity of the agents when administered alone. Only CR was used to evaluate tumor responses. The combination resulted in significantly greater than expected CRs than individual agents in nine tumor lines (four neuroblastoma, three brain tumors, and two rhabdomyosarcomas). Similar event-free (failure) distributions were shown in SJ-GBM2 glioblastoma xenografts, whether vincristine was administered on day 1 or day 5 of each topotecan course. To determine whether the increased antitumor activity with the combination was attributable to a change in drug disposition, extensive pharmacokinetic studies were performed. However, little or no interaction between these two agents was determined. Toxicity of the combination was marked by prolonged thrombocytopenia and decreased hemoglobin. However, approximately 75 and 80% of the maximum tolerated dose of each single agent, topotecan (1.5 mg/kg) or vincristine (1 mg/kg), could be given in combination, resulting in a combination toxicity index of approximately 1.5. These results show that the therapeutic effect of combining topotecan with vincristine was greater than additive in most tumor models of childhood solid tumors, and toxicity data suggest that this can be administered to mice with only moderate reduction in the dose levels for each agent.

Title:Relation between complement and the febrile response of guinea pigs to systemic endotoxin.
Authors:['Li S', 'Sehic E', 'Wang Y', 'Ungar AL', 'Blatteis CM']
Affiliation:Department of Physiology, University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.
Abstract:We reported recently that the complement (C) system may play a role in the febrile response of guinea pigs to intravenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration because C depletion abolished the LPS-induced rise in core temperature (T(c)). The present study was designed to investigate further the relation between C reduction [induced by cobra venom factor (CVF); 20, 50, 100, and 200 U/animal iv] and the fever of adult, conscious guinea pigs produced by LPS injected intravenously (2 microg/kg) or intraperitoneally (8, 16, 32 microg/kg) 18 h after CVF; control animals received pyrogen-free saline. Serum C levels were measured as total hemolytic C activity before and 18 h after CVF injection and expressed as CH(100) units. In other experiments, serum C levels were determined at various intervals after the intravenous and intraperitoneal injections at different doses of LPS alone. LPS produced fevers generally of similar heights but of different onset latencies and durations, depending on the dose and route of administration. CVF caused dose-related reductions in serum C, from approximately 1,136 U to below detection. These reductions proportionately attenuated the fevers induced by intraperitoneal LPS, but not by intravenous LPS. Intravenous and intraperitoneal LPS per se caused reductions in serum C of 25 and 40%, respectively, indicating activation of the C cascade. These decreases were transient, however, occurring early during the febrile rise approximately 30 min after LPS injection. These data thus support the notion that the C system may be critically involved in the febrile response of guinea pigs to systemic, particularly intraperitoneal, LPS.

Title:Prolactin and testosterone affect seasonal differences in male meadow vole, microtus pennsylvanicus, odor preferences for female conspecifics.
Authors:['Leonard ST', 'Ferkin MH']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Department of Biology, TN 38152-6080, USA. sleonard@memphis.edu
Abstract:Studies on nonseasonally breeding males have demonstrated that high titers of testosterone (T) stimulate reproduction, whereas high titers of prolactin (PRL) inhibit it. Recent evidence, however, suggests that for seasonally breeding males high titers of both PRL and T stimulate behaviors that support reproduction and mating. Thus, we hypothesized that high titers of both PRL and T are necessary and sufficient for male meadow voles to show a preference for the odor of long-photoperiod (LP) females. We tested this hypothesis by treating castrated LP males with bromocriptine and/or T, and by treating castrated short-photoperiod (SP) males with PRL and/or T. The data showed that high titers of both PRL and T are necessary for LP male meadow voles to maintain a preference for the odor of LP female meadow voles, but high titers of both hormones are not sufficient to induce SP males to show such a preference. Only SP males with high T and low PRL titers showed preferences for LP female odors. Interestingly. SP males with high PRL and high T titers preferred the odor of LP males, and SP males with high PRL and low T titers preferred the odors of SP females. The apparent contradictory effects of PRL and T in SP males suggest that the hormonal control of seasonal differences of male odor preferences may be more complex than previously believed.

This user-friendly software can be used to construct MPT models and conduct statistical inferences, including point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and goodness of fit. Furthermore, this program can be used to examine the robustness of MPT models. Algorithms for parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and Monte Carlo simulation are presented.

Title:Relative roles of cement molecular weight and mixing method on the fatigue performance of acrylic bone cement: Simplex P versus Osteopal.
Authors:['Lewis G']

Abstract:The weight-average molecular weight (MW(w)) of a cement and the method used to mix its powder and liquid monomer constituents have been identified in the literature as key variables that affect mechanical properties of the fully polymerized cement that are relevant to its performance as a grouting agent in cemented arthroplasties. The goal of the present work was to identify which of these two variables exerts the greater effect in the case of fully reversed tension-compression fatigue performance. A judicious choice of cement brands, Surgical Simplex P and Osteopal, and the use of hand versus vacuum mixing, permitted this identification to be achieved. Three key observations were made in this work. First, for a given cement, the fatigue performance of vacuum-mixed specimens is far superior to that of hand-mixed ones, which may be a consequence of the substantially lower percentage areal porosity of the former specimens. Second, regardless of the mixing method, the fatigue performance of Osteopal outstrips that of Simplex P, a result that is attributed to the much higher MW(w) of the former cement. Third, hand-mixed Osteopal outperforms vacuum-mixed Simplex P (especially at low alternating stress levels), indicating that MW(w) of a bone cement is more influential than mixing method on its fatigue performance.

Title:Effects of marital conflict on subsequent triadic family interactions and parenting.
Authors:['Kitzmann KM']

Abstract:This study examined marital conflict's indirect effects on children through disruptions in family alliances and parenting. Forty married couples were observed interacting with their 6-8-year-old sons after pleasant and conflictual discussions. After conflictual discussion, fathers showed lower support/engagement toward sons, and coparenting styles were less democratic. Couple negativity was correlated with family negativity, regardless of the topic of discussion, which suggests continuity in the affective quality of the two family subsystems. Mothers' marital satisfaction moderated families' responses to the experimental manipulation. The results provide stronger evidence than previously available of a causal link between conflict and disrupted parenting. Further research is needed to identify which conflict-related disruptions in parenting influence the development of children's problems.

Title:Viresin. A novel antibacterial protein from immune hemolymph of Heliothis virescens pupae.
Authors:['Chung KT', 'Ourth DD']
Affiliation:Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Immune hemolymph was collected from fifth instar larvae and 1-day-old pupae of Heliothis virescens after injection of prepupae with live Enterobacter cloacae. Induction of antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli K12 D31 was 7.5 times greater in pupal than in larval immune hemolymph. Lysozyme activity of immune pupal hemolymph against Micrococcus lysodeikticus was 11 times greater when compared with lysozyme activity of immune larval hemolymph. Early pupal immune response with regard to antibacterial activity was much greater than larval immune response in H. virescens. Normal pupal hemolymph showed an increase in antibacterial activity and lysozyme that was induced during metamorphosis. Antibacterial protein was isolated together with lysozyme by gel filtration chromatography and then separated from lysozyme by sequential electrophoresis with a native acid gel and SDS gel. Molecular mass of antibacterial protein was estimated to be 12 kDa. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of 12-kDa protein was different from those of antibacterial molecules found in other insects and has not been identified before. A sample containing 12-kDa protein was negative for immunoblotting with anti-synthetic cecropin B antibody. We have named the novel 12-kDa antibacterial protein viresin. Viresin showed antibacterial activity against several Gram-negative bacteria including E. cloacae but not against Gram-positive bacteria.

Title:Activity of the phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathway modulates the distribution of fatty acids into glycerolipids in proliferating cells.

Abstract:PtdCho accumulation is a periodic, S phase-specific event that is modulated in part by cell cycle-dependent fluctuations in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) activity. A supply of fatty acids is essential to generate the diacylglycerol (DG) precursors for phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) biosynthesis but it is not known whether the DG supply is also coupled to the cell cycle. Although the rate of fatty acid synthesis in a macrophage cell line was dramatically stimulated in response to the growth factor, CSF-1, it was not regulated by the cell cycle. Increased fatty acid synthesis correlated with elevated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) steady-state mRNA levels. Cellular fatty acid synthesis was essential for membrane PL synthesis. Cerulenin inhibition of endogenous fatty acid synthesis also inhibited PtdCho synthesis, which was not relieved by exogenous fatty acids. Inhibition of CCT activity by the addition of lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPtdCho) or temperature-shift of a conditionally defective CCT diverted newly synthesized DG to the TG pool where it accumulated. Enforced expression of CCT stimulated PtdCho biosynthesis and reduced TG synthesis. Thus, the cellular DG supply did not regulate PtdCho biosynthesis and CCT activity governs the partitioning of DG into either the PL or TG pools, thereby controlling both PtdCho and TG biosynthesis.

Abstract:Neutrophils can attach to E-selectin under flow. Proposed ligands for E-selectin carry SLe(x)-type glycans. The leukocyte beta2 integrins are glycosylated with SLe(x). Thus, we speculated that beta2 integrins could support attachment to E-selectin. To test this hypothesis, we coated 10-microm-diameter microspheres with purified CD11b/CD18 (alphaMbeta2) and investigated the adhesion of the resulting alphaMbeta2 microspheres to E-selectin. Under in vitro flow conditions, the alphaMbeta2 microspheres attached to Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing E-selectin (CHO-E) and 4-h interleukin-1beta-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). At a shear stress of 1.8 dynes/cm2, the attachment events were eliminated by pretreatment of the cellular monolayers with a mAb to E-selectin. alphaMbeta2 microspheres did not attach to untransfected CHO cells or unactivated HUVEC at 1.8 dynes/cm2. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that the CD11b/CD18-E-selectin bond has sufficient biophysical properties to mediate attachment of neutrophil-sized particles to E-selectin under flow.

Abstract:We colocalized nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in epithelial cells that surround the salivary gland duct in female Dermacentor variabilis with NADPH diaphorase histochemistry and immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal anti-endothelial NOS. Using size-exclusion chromatography, a fraction with a molecular mass of about 185 kDa that had diaphorase activity was eluted from tick salivary gland homogenate. This fraction converted arginine to citrulline with the production of nitric oxide (NO), which was detected by using electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The complete activity of the diaphorase fraction was dependent on NADPH, FAD, tetrahydrobiopterin, calmodulin, (CaM), and Ca(2+), but was not dependent on dithiothreitol. The arginine analog N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine inhibited the activity of this fraction. NO and arginine activated soluble guanylate cyclase to produce cGMP in dopamine-stimulated isolated salivary glands. Dopamine-stimulated isolated salivary glands treated with tick saline containing either EDTA, the NOS inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, or the calcium/CaM binding inhibitor W-7 showed no increase in cGMP. The NO donor sodium nitroprusside significantly increased cGMP levels in unstimulated isolated salivary glands. A possible function for NO in salivation by this ixodid tick is discussed.

Title:Effect of two variables on the fatigue performance of acrylic bone cement: mixing method and viscosity.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152-6576, USA.
Abstract:The goal of the present work was to establish the relative influence of one exogenous variable versus one endogenous variable on the fully-reversed tension-compression fatigue performance of bone cement. The method used to mix the cement constituents was the exogenous variable, while the viscosity of the mixed cement dough was the endogenous variable. Two commercial cement formulations (Palacos R and Osteopal) and two cement mixing methods (hand mixing and vacuum mixing) were used. It was found that for a given mixing method, cement viscosity exerts a marginal influence on fatigue performance. On the other hand, for a given cement formulation, vacuum mixing led to a statistically significant improvement in fatigue performance. The present results demonstrate the superior influence of mixing method over cement viscosity.

Affiliation:Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. kchung@memphis.edu
Abstract:Four nitrated aromatic amines (2-nitro-p-phenylenediamine [2NPD], 3-nitro-o-phenylenediamine [3NPD], 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine [4NPD] and 4,4'-dinitro-2-biphenylamine [DNBA]) are direct-acting mutagens in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100. These compounds were tested further using the Xenometrix strains of S. typhimurium: TA7001, TA7002, TA7003, TA7004, TA7005, and TA7006, with and without S9 mix in the plate incorporation assay. The direct-acting mutagenicity of 2NPD, 4NPD, and DNBA was detected with TA7002, TA7004 and TA7005. 2NPD and DNBA showed some activity in TA7006; DNBA also showed some activity in TA7003. Mutagenicity was generally decreased in these strains when S9 was added. 3NPD was mutagenic in TA7004 without S9 and in TA7005 with and without S9. These data suggest that 2NPD, 4NPD and DNBA induced TA-->AT and CG-->AT transversions as well as GC-->AT transitions in the his gene. 3NPD induced CG-->AT transversions and GC-->AT transitions. 2NPD and DNBA also induced a small portion of CG-->GC transversions.

Title:p16/MTS1/INK4A suppresses prostate cancer by both pRb dependent and independent pathways.

Abstract:Tumor suppressor gene p16 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and an important negative cell cycle regulator. The inactivation of p16 appears to be a common event in prostate cancer. Replacement of p16 inhibits prostate tumor cell growth, but the mechanism is not known. Human prostate cancer cell lines PPC-1, which has an inactivated p16, and DU145, which has a nonfunctional retinoblastoma Rb protein (pRb), were used to determine the possible mechanism of p16 mediated growth inhibition. PPC-1 cells treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), a demethylating agent, induced p16 expression, inhibited cell growth, and induced senescence. Similarly, PPC-1 cells transduced by an adenoviral vector containing the p16 gene (AdRSVp16) produced a p16 protein that suppressed cellular proliferation and induced senescence. Co-staining of AdRSVp16-transduced PPC-1 cells by p16 immunohistochemistry and by beta-galactosidase substrate X-gal showed that the morphologically enlarged cells expressed both p16 and senescence-associated beta-galactosidase. In contrast, AdRSVp16 did not induce senescence in DU145 cells, but did inhibit its growth. However, when wild-type pRb was introduced in DU145 cells, AdRSVp16 was able to induce senescence. Thus, the mechanism by which p16 suppressed prostate cancer was dependent on the pRb functional status of cells whereby p16 caused pRb+ cells to undergo inhibition by senescence, whereas pRb- cells were also inhibited, but not by senescence.

Title:Isolation and characterization of a cDNA encoding a horse liver butyrylcholinesterase: evidence for CPT-11 drug activation.
Authors:['Wierdl M', 'Morton CL', 'Danks MK', 'Potter PM']
Affiliation:Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.
Abstract:Butyrylcholinesterases (BuChEs; acylcholine acylhydrolase; EC 3.1.1.8) have been demonstrated to convert the anticancer agent CPT-11 (irinotecan, 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin) into its active metabolite SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin). In addition, significant differences in the extent of drug metabolism have been observed with BuChEs derived from different species. In an attempt to understand these differences, we have isolated the cDNA encoding a horse BuChE. Based upon the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of a purified horse BuChE, we designed degenerate primers to amplify the coding sequence from horse liver cDNA. Following polymerase chain reaction and rapid amplification of the cDNA ends, we generated an 1850-bp DNA fragment, containing an 1806-bp open reading frame. The cDNA encodes a protein of 602 amino acid residues, including a 28-amino-acid NH2-terminal signal peptide. Furthermore, the DNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence revealed extensive homology to butyrylcholinesterase genes from several other species. In vitro transcription-translation of the cDNA produced a 66-kDa protein, identical to the size of native horse serum BuChE following removal of carbohydrate residues with endoglycosidase F. Additionally, transient expression of the cDNA in Cos-7 cells yielded extracts that exhibited cholinesterase activity and demonstrated a Km value for butyrylthiocholine of 106+/-9 nM. This extract converted the anticancer drug CPT-11 into SN-38, demonstrating that this drug can be activated by enzymes other than carboxylesterases.

Affiliation:Exercise Science Laboratory, Georgia Southern University, Statesboro, USA. lweiss@memphis.edu
Abstract:STUDY DESIGN: Pretest-posttest, single factor design. OBJECTIVES: To compare several indices that might be used to depict muscle size. BACKGROUND: The particular strategy used during heavy-resistance training may determine the magnitude of hypertrophic adaptations. At the same time, assorted measures supposedly reflecting muscle size may provide different results. METHODS AND MEASURES: Four groups of men (n = 38, mean age = 21.1 years, SD = 2.1) were exposed to conditions designed to elicit differential hypertrophic adaptations following 21 sessions of squat training. Three of the groups performed 4 sets of multiple repetitions maximum (RM): group I, 3-5 RM; group II, 13-15 RM; and group III, 23-25 RM. A control (C) group did no formal physical training. Tests used to represent muscle size included body weight, thigh girth, net thigh girth, and quadriceps femoris and hamstring thicknesses via B-mode ultrasound. RESULTS: Changes in the groups subsequent to training were similar for body weight and hamstring thickness. Results differed for the remaining 3 dependent variables (mean +/- SD): thigh girth was greater in groups II (1.42 +/- 1.00) and III (1.35 +/- 1.16) than in group C (0.24 +/- 0.69); net thigh girth was greater in groups II (1.33 +/- 0.77) and III (1.40 +/- 1.03) than in group C (0.10 +/- 0.84); and quadriceps femoris thickness was greater in all 3 training groups (I, 0.61 +/- 0.54; II, 0.43 +/- 0.30; III, 0.55 +/- 0.39) than in group C (0.05 +/- 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Observed muscle mass change following heavy-resistance training is dependent upon both the training intervention and tool used for measurement.

Title:Mutation of a glutamate receptor motif reveals its role in gating and delta2 receptor channel properties.
Authors:['Kohda K', 'Wang Y', 'Yuzaki M']
Affiliation:Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.
Abstract:Despite its importance in the cerebellum, the functions of the orphan glutamate receptor delta2 are unknown. We examined a mutant delta2 receptor channel in lurcher mice that was constitutively active in the absence of ligand. Because this mutation was within a highly conserved motif (YTANLAAF), we tested its effect on several glutamate receptors. Mutant delta2 receptors showed distinct channel properties, including double rectification of the current-voltage relationship, sensitivity to a polyamine antagonist and moderate Ca 2+ permeability, whereas other constitutively active mutant glutamate channels resembled wild-type channels in these respects. Moreover, the kinetics of ligand-activated currents were strikingly altered. We conclude that the delta2 receptor has a functional ion channel pore similar to that of glutamate receptors. The motif may have a role in the channel gating of glutamate receptors.

Abstract:It is estimated that there will be >184,500 new cases of prostate cancer and 42,000 prostate cancer deaths in the United States this year. In the majority of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, the disease will be too advanced for cure with standard medical treatment. New therapeutic strategies against advanced prostate cancer are desperately needed. As alterations in tumor-suppressor gene p16 are common in prostate cancer, one novel approach is gene therapy using a replication-deficient, E1/E3-deleted adenovirus type 5 containing a p16 under the control of a truncated Rous sarcoma virus promoter (AdRSVp16). In vitro, PC-3 cells that had been stably transfected with p16 expression vector under the control of an inducible promoter had a 70% reduction in cell number compared with the parental and control vector-transfected PC-3 cells. Similarly, AdRSVp16 significantly inhibited the growth of PPC-1 and PC-3 prostate cancer cells in culture. Furthermore, PPC-1 tumors grown in nude mice treated by a single injection of AdRSVp16 had a marked reduction in tumor size compared with untreated control-treated or viral control-treated PPC-1 tumors. Animals bearing tumors treated with AdRSVp16 also had longer survival. Adenovirally mediated expression of transgene was detected in xenograft tumors for at least 2 weeks. Taken together, these results suggest that AdRSVp16 should be considered for prostate cancer gene therapy in human clinical trials.

Title:Binding sites for human interferon-gamma in protocerebrum and hemolymph of tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) larvae differ in sensitivity to polycationic peptides.
Authors:['Parker MS', 'Ourth DD']
Affiliation:Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:We have recently characterized specific binding sites for human interferon-gamma on particulates prepared from the protocerebrum and hemolymph of tobacco hornworm larvae, Manduca sexta inverted question mark(Parker, M.S., Ourth, D.D., 1999. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B 122, 155-163). The sensitivity to sulfated polysaccharides indicated an involvement of oligobasic epitopes of hIFN-gamma in the binding. In the present study, we found that polycationic peptides inhibited the binding of [125I]hIFN-gamma to particulates from either the hemolymph or the protocerebrum of Manduca sexta larvae. With amino acid homopolymers, the rank order of potency was poly-L-lysine > poly-L-arginine >> poly-L-ornithine, while the acidic side chain polymer poly-L-aspartate was not inhibitory. However, the potency of all polycationic peptides was at least three-fold greater at the hemolymph particulates. Also, acidic polysaccharides such as heparin were much more efficacious in the inhibition of hIFN-gamma binding to hemolymph relative to protocerebral particulates. The peptide polycations inhibited the binding of [125I](Leu31,Pro34)human peptide YY, a ligand selective for the Y1 subtype of the neuropeptide Y receptor, to rabbit kidney or to parietal cortex particulates with the expected rank order of poly-L-arginine > poly-L-lysine >> poly-L-ornithine, and with little cross-tissue difference in affinity. The selectivity observed with M. sexta particulates indicates a preferential involvement of oligobasic lysine-rich C-terminal sequences of IFN-gamma, while large insect tissue-related affinity differences point to involvement of diverse oligoacidic sequences in binding to protocerebrum and hemolymph sites. This study provides evidence for the presence of molecules in lepidopteran larvae that are similar in structure to vertebrate co-receptors of IFN-gamma, and adds to the characterization of these binding sites.

Title:A new method of determining the J-integral fracture toughness of very tough polymers: application to ultra high molecular weight polyethylene.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Nyman JS']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152-6576, USA.
Abstract:The thrust of the present work was the development of a new modification to the ASTM E813-89 method for determining the J-integral fracture toughness, JIc, of ductile polymers. The advantages and limitations of the modification, vis a vis the ASTM E813-89 and the hysteresis methods, are presented. The modification was then applied to investigate the effect of sterilization method on the JIc of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) specimens that were subsequently aged (heated, in a cylindrical pressure vessel, in oxygen gas at 507 kPa and 70 degrees C for 14 d). Relative to the unsterilized material, it was found that gamma-irradiating the polymer leads to a significant drop in its JIc, while sterilization using either ethylene oxide or gas plasma produced no effect on its JIc. The clinical implications of the present results for the in vivo performance of UHMWPE counterfaces, and, hence, hip and knee arthroplasties, are fully discussed.

Title:Inactivation of aldophosphamide by human aldehyde dehydrogenase isozyme 3.

Abstract:Tumors resistant to chemotherapeutic oxazaphosphorines such as cyclophosphamide often overexpress aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), some isozymes of which catalyze the oxidization of aldophosphamide, an intermediate of cyclophosphamide activation, with formation of inert carboxyphosphamide. Since resistance to oxazaphosphorines can be produced in mammalian cells by transfecting them with the gene for human ALDH isozyme 3 (hALDH3), it seems possible that patients receiving therapy for solid tumors with cyclophosphamide might be protected from myelosuppression by their prior transplantation with autologous bone marrow that has been transduced with a retroviral vector causing overexpression of hALDH3. We investigated whether retroviral introduction of hALDH3 into a human leukemia cell line confers resistance to oxazaphosphorines. This was examined in the polyclonal transduced population, that is, without selecting out high expression clones. hALDH3 activity was 0.016 IU/mg protein in the transduced cells (compared with 2x10(-5) IU/mg in untransduced cells), but there was no detectable resistance to aldophosphamide-generating compounds (mafosfamide or 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide). The lack of protection was due, in part, to low catalytic activity of hALDH3 towards aldophosphamide, since, with NAD as cofactor, the catalytic efficiency of homogeneous, recombinant hALDH3 for aldophosphamide oxidation was shown to be about seven times lower than that of recombinant hALDH1. The two polymorphic forms of hALDH3 had identical kinetics with either benzaldehyde or aldophosphamide as substrate. Results of initial velocity measurements were consistent with an ordered sequential mechanism for ALDH1 but not for hALDH3; a kinetic mechanism for the latter is proposed, and the corresponding rate equation is presented.

Abstract:QUAID (question-understanding aid) is a software tool that assists survey methodologists, social scientists, and designers of questionnaires in improving the wording, syntax, and semantics of questions. The tool identifies potential problems that respondents might have in comprehending the meaning of questions on questionnaires. These problems can be scrutinized by researchers when they revise questions to improve question comprehension and, thereby, enhance the reliability and validity of answers. QUAID was designed to identify nine classes of problems, but only five of these problems are addressed in this article: unfamiliar technical term, vague or imprecise relative term, vague or ambiguous noun phrase, complex syntax, and working memory overload. We compared the output of QUAID with ratings of language experts who evaluated a corpus of questions on the five classes of problems. The corpus consisted of 505 questions on 11 surveys developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. Analyses of hit rates, false alarm rates, d' scores, recall scores, and precision scores revealed that QUAID was able to identify these five problems with questions, although improvements in QUAID's performance are anticipated in future research and development.

Title:An assessment of the attention demands during random- and blocked-practice schedules.
Authors:['Li Y', 'Wright DL']
Affiliation:Department of Human Movement Sciences and Education, University of Memphis, USA.
Abstract:The reported study used the dual-task methodology to assess the attention demands associated with high and low contextual interference (CI) practice environments. Two specific issues were addressed. First, is there a difference in the attention demands during random and blocked schedules of practice? Second, what is the time course of any differential attention demands that emerge during random and blocked training? In order to address these questions two specific temporal loci were probed during practice: a pre-response interval and the inter-trial interval. It was assumed that the pre-response interval contained the reconstructive activity that is central to the reconstruction position. In contrast, the inter-trial interval has been interpreted in previous work to be the interval in which critical intra- and inter-item processing is performed during random practice. The data revealed a typical CI effect for the primary key-pressing task. Specifically, blocked-practice participants displayed superior performance during training but performed less well than the random-practice individuals at the time of retention. The poorer acquisition performance of the random-practice participants was associated with higher cognitive demand during both the pre-response and the inter-trial intervals than that of individuals assigned to blocked practice. The greater attention demands for random-practice individuals are discussed with respect to processes that might occur in both the pre-response and the inter-trial intervals.

Title:Attenuation of acoustic emission body waves in acrylic bone cement and synthetic bone using wavelet time-scale analysis.
Authors:['Qi G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-6576, USA.
Abstract:This article addresses acoustic emission (AE) wave attenuation in acrylic bone cement and wave attenuation due to the existence of material interface between acrylic bone cement and sawbone. In this article, a series of tests were performed using standard pencil lead break sources. The attenuation features inside acrylic bone cement and sawbone materials and the attenuation due to the existence of material interfaces such as cement-cement and cement-sawbone were studied. In addition, the discrete wavelet-based signal energy decomposition method was introduced to examine detail breakdown of signal energy distribution of attenuation. From the tests, it was observed that the attenuation of AE signal was linear with respect to the wave travel distance for both energy and amplitude. Furthermore, AE energy attenuation was more sensitive than AE amplitude attenuation. In the analysis of attenuation due to material interfaces, the couplant plays a major role in reducing the attenuation at the interfaces. The attenuation at an interface composed by different material is less compared with an interface composed by the same material.

Abstract:The Ames Salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of benzidine and its analogs using strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat S9 mix. 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine-2HCl and 4,4'-dinitro-2-biphenylamine were directly mutagenic to TA98, while 4,4'-dinitro-2-biphenylamine was directly mutagenic to both TA98 and TA100 in the absence of S9 mix. 2-Aminobiphenyl, 3-aminobiphenyl, and 3,3'-5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine were not mutagenic in either strains in the presence or absence of S9. In the presence of S9 mix, 4-aminobiphenyl, benzidine, 3, 3'-dichlorobenzidine-2HCl, 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine, 3,3'-4, 4'-tetraaminobiphenyl, o-tolidine, N, N-N', N'-tetramethylbenzidine, and 4,4'-dinitro-2-biphenylamine were mutagenic to TA98; 4-aminobiphenyl, 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine-2HCl, 3, 3'-dimethoxybenzidine, and 4,4'-dinitro-2-biphenylamine were mutagenic to TA100. Physicochemical parameters of these compounds including oxidation potentials, the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and the highest occupied molecular orbital, ionization potentials, dipole moment, relative partition coefficient, and basicity did not correlate with their bacterial mutagenic activities.

Title:Estimation of HIV infection and incubation via state space models.
Authors:['Tan WY', 'Ye Z']
Affiliation:Department of Mathematical Sciences, The University of Memphis, 335 Winfield Dunn, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. waitan@memphis.edu
Abstract:By using the state space model (Kalman filter model) of the HIV epidemic, in this paper we have developed a general Bayesian procedure to estimate simultaneously the HIV infection distribution, the HIV incubation distribution, the numbers of susceptible people, infective people and AIDS cases. The basic approach is to use the Gibbs sampling method combined with the weighted bootstrap method. We have applied this method to the San Francisco AIDS incidence data from January 1981 to December 1992. The results show clearly that both the probability density function of the HIV infection and the probability density function of the HIV incubation are curves with two peaks. The results of the HIV infection distribution are clearly consistent with the finding by Tan et al. [W.Y. Tan, S.C. Tang, S.R. Lee, Estimation of HIV seroconversion and effects of age in San Francisco homosexual populations, J. Appl. Stat. 25 (1998) 85]. The results of HIV incubation distribution seem to confirm the staged model used by Satten and Longini [G. Satten, I. Longini, Markov chain with measurement error: estimating the 'true' course of marker of the progression of human immunodeficiency virus disease, Appl. Stat. 45 (1996) 275].

Abstract:The camptothecin prodrug CPT-11 (irinotecan, 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin) is converted by esterases to yield the potent topoisomerase I poison SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin). Recently, a mouse strain (Es1(e)) has been identified that demonstrates reduced plasma esterase activity, and we have monitored the ability of plasma from these mice to metabolize CPT-11. Total plasma esterase activity was reduced 3-fold in Esl(e)mice in comparison to control mice, and this resulted in a 200-fold reduction in SN-38 production after incubation with CPT-11 in vitro. In addition, pharmacokinetic studies of CPT-11 and SN-38 in these animals demonstrated approximately 5-fold less conversion to SN-38. However, extracts derived from tissues from Es1(e) animals revealed total esterase activities similar to those of control mice, and these extracts metabolized CPT-11 with equal efficiency. Northern analysis of RNA isolated from organs indicated that the liver was the primary source of Es-1 gene expression and that very low levels of Es-1 RNA were present in Es1(e) mice. These results suggest that the reduced levels of Es-1 esterase present in Es1(e) mice are due to down-regulation of gene transcription, and that this plasma esterase is responsible for the majority of CPT-11 metabolism in mice.

Title:Relative influence of composition and viscosity of acrylic bone cement on its apparent fracture toughness.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The composition and viscosity of an acrylic bone cement have both been identified in the literature as being parameters that affect the mechanical properties of the material and, by extension, the in vivo longevity of cemented arthroplasties. The objective of the present study was to determine the relative influence of these parameters on a key cement mechanical property; namely, its fracture toughness. Two sets of cements were selected purposefully to allow the study objective to be achieved. Thus, one set comprised two cements with very similar compositions but very different viscosities (Cemex RX, a medium-viscosity brand, and Cemex Isoplastic, a high-viscosity brand) while the other set comprised two cements with similar viscosities but with many differences in composition (Cemex Isoplastic and CMW 1). Values of the fracture toughness (as determined using chevron-notched short rod specimens) [K(ISR)] obtained for Cemex RX and Cemex Isoplastic were 1.83 +/- 0.12 and 1.85 +/- 0.12 MPa square root(m), respectively, with the difference not being statistically significant. The K(ISR) values obtained for Cemex Isoplastic and CMW 1 were 1.85 +/- 0.12 and 1.64 +/- 0.18 MPa square root(m), respectively, with the difference being statistically significant. Thus, the influence of cement composition on its K(ISR) is more marked relative to the influence of cement viscosity. Explanations of this finding are offered, together with comments on the implications of the results for the in vivo longevity of cemented arthroplasties.

Abstract:This study addresses the visualization of crack locations in bone-cement material using a three-dimensional acoustic emission source location technique. Computer software based on an earthquake location technique was developed to determine AE source locations and was used to investigate material cracks formed at the tip of a notch in bone cement. The computed locations show that the cracks form linear features with dimensions between 0.1 and 0.2 mm although larger linear features (almost 3.5 mm) also are present. There is a difference of about 2.5 mm between the average of the event locations, and the location of the tip of the notch is 2.5 mm, which may be due to the finite size of the sensors (5 mm in diameter).

Authors:['Steiner MS', 'Zhang X', 'Wang Y', 'Lu Y']
Affiliation:Department of Urology, University of Tennessee-Memphis 38163, USA.
Abstract:It has been estimated that there will be > 180,400 new cases of prostate cancer and 31,900 prostate cancer deaths in the United States this year. New therapeutic strategies against locally advanced prostate cancer are desperately needed. A novel gene (pHyde) was identified by an improved cDNA competition hybridization technique for Dunning rat prostate cancer cell lines. A recombinant replication-deficient E1/E3-deleted adenovirus type 5 containing a pHyde gene under the control of a truncated Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter (AdRSVpHyde) was generated. In vitro, AdRSVpHyde significantly inhibited growth of human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP in culture. In vivo, a single injection of AdRSVpHyde (5 x 10(9) plaque-forming units) reduced DU145 tumors in nude mice remarkably compared with untreated control or viral control-treated DU145 tumors. Moreover, AdRSVpHyde induced apoptosis and stimulated p53 expression. These results together suggest that pHyde is a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits growth of prostate cancer and that this inhibition is at least in part due to the induction of apoptosis.

Title:Expectations about hearing aids and their relationship to fitting outcome.

Affiliation:School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, University of Memphis, and Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:Clinicians are often concerned that unrealistic prefitting expectations can have a negative impact on fitting success for new, hearing aid wearers. To investigate this concern and to explore the potential value of measuring expectations, we developed the Expected Consequences of Hearing aid Ownership (ECHO) questionnaire as a companion to the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life questionnaire. Four experiments were conducted to (1) determine realistic expectations for hearing aids, (2) evaluate expectations of new users, (3) measure reliability of prefitting expectations, and (4) assess relationships between prefitting expectations and postfitting satisfaction. Novice hearing aid users were found to have stable prefitting expectations about hearing aids, and these expectations were unrealistically high for the typical individual. There were many different expectation patterns across subjects. Of the four subscales of the ECHO, only one was predictive of the corresponding satisfaction data. Potential clinical applications are described.

Abstract:The cytokines interleukin 7 (IL-7) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) regulate lymphoid differentiation and function and activate the transcription factor Stat5. Using mice deficient for the 2 highly related transcription factors, Stat5a and Stat5b (Stat5a/b(-/-)), we investigated the role of Stat5 for B-cell differentiation, expansion, and function. Peripheral blood B cells of Stat5-deficient mice are significantly reduced, but no proliferation defects in response to various mitogenic stimuli are found. Also, IgM and IgG1 antibody production and immunoglobulin class switching are not affected. Pre- and pro-B cells of Stat5-deficient animals were found to have reduced responses to IL-7. Pro- and pre-B cells are the target cells of the abl oncogene and numerous studies have suggested that Stat5a/b is essential for transformation by derivatives of the Abelson (abl) gene. To assess the role of Stat5a/b in transformation, we have evaluated the ability of various abl derivatives to transform cells from Stat5a/b-deficient mice in vitro or in vivo. We demonstrate that the absence of Stat5a/b is not essential for the induction of lymphoid or myeloid tumors in vivo or on the ability to transform bone marrow cells in vitro.

Abstract:Originating from its DNA sequence, a computational model of the Edg1 receptor has been developed that predicts critical interactions with its ligand, sphingosine 1-phosphate. The basic amino acids Arg(120) and Arg(292) ion pair with the phosphate, whereas the acidic Glu(121) residue ion pairs with the ammonium moiety of sphingosine 1-phosphate. The requirement of these interactions for specific ligand recognition has been confirmed through examination of site-directed mutants by radioligand binding, ligand-induced [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding, and receptor internalization assays. These ion-pairing interactions explain the ligand specificity of the Edg1 receptor and provide insight into ligand specificity differences within the Edg receptor family. This computational map of the ligand binding pocket provides information necessary for understanding the molecular pharmacology of this receptor, thus underlining the potential of the computational method in predicting ligand-receptor interactions.

Title:Distortion product otoacoustic emissions to single and simultaneous tone pairs.
Authors:['Schairer KS', 'Clukey C', 'Gould HJ']

Abstract:Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) evoked by single tone pairs and three simultaneous tone pairs were recorded in 60 normal-hearing adult ears. The purpose was to replicate a previous study using the commercially available probe assembly of the Grason Stadler GSI 60 and including ear of presentation in the statistical analysis along with frequency and condition. DPOAE levels were comparable between ears and conditions, although differences among frequencies were found. Noise levels were comparable between ears and tended to increase with increases in frequency for both conditions. The latter trend was not noted with the previous study and may be due to differences in the probe assembly and/or test environment. Further, noise levels were significantly greater at 2,000 and 8,000 Hz in the simultaneous condition. Caution should be exercised when interpreting results in the simultaneous condition because not all frequencies may have optimal signal-to-noise ratios when the test is terminated.

Title:Interleukin 8, neutrophil-activating peptide-2 and GRO-alpha bind to and elicit cell activation via specific and different amino acid residues of CXCR2.
Authors:['Katancik JA', 'Sharma A', 'de Nardin E']
Affiliation:Department of Periodontology, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:The objective of this investigation was to determine the amino acid residues of the human neutrophil CXC chemokine receptor-2 (CXCR2) that are critical for binding the ligands interleukin 8 (IL-8), neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2), and growth-related protein alpha (GROalpha) and critical for receptor-mediated signal transduction. Charged residues of the amino terminus and the first extracellular loop of CXCR2 were targeted for point mutagenesis studies. Seven separate CXCR2 mutants (Glu7, Asp9, Glu12, Asp13, Lys108, Asn110, and Lys120, all to Ala) were generated. Based on the Scatchard analysis of radioligand binding studies, the following amino acids were deemed critical for ligand binding: (i) Asp9, Glu12, Lys108, and Lys120 for IL-8 and (ii) Glu7, Asp9, and Glu12 for GROalpha. Point mutations in the amino terminus domain (Asp9 and Glu12) and the first extracellular loop (Lys108, Asn110, and Lys120) of CXCR2 reduced cell activation to all three ligands as measured by changes in intracellular calcium concentration. In conclusion, high-affinity binding of IL-8, NAP-2, and GROalpha to CXCR2 involves interaction with specific and different amino acid residues of CXCR2. Furthermore, we propose that the CXCR2 amino acid residues required for cell activation are not necessarily the same residues required for ligand binding.

Title:Overexpression of a mammalian ethanolamine-specific kinase accelerates the CDP-ethanolamine pathway.
Authors:['Lykidis A', 'Wang J', 'Karim MA', 'Jackowski S']
Affiliation:Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.
Abstract:Ethanolamine kinase (EKI) is the first committed step in phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) biosynthesis via the CDP-ethanolamine pathway. We identify a human cDNA encoding an ethanolamine-specific kinase EKI1 and the structure of the EKI1 gene located on chromosome 12. EKI1 overexpression in COS-7 cells results in a 170-fold increase in ethanolamine kinase-specific activity and accelerates the rate of [3H]ethanolamine incorporation into PtdEtn as a function of the ethanolamine concentration in the culture medium. Acceleration of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway does not result in elevated cellular PtdEtn levels, but rather the excess PtdEtn is degraded to glycerophosphoethanolamine. EKI1 has negligible choline kinase activity in vitro and does not influence phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. Acceleration of the CDP-ethanolamine pathway also does not change the rate of PtdEtn formation via the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. The data demonstrate the existence of separate ethanolamine and choline kinases in mammals and show that ethanolamine kinase can be a rate-controlling step in PtdEtn biosynthesis.

Title:Surface-enhanced raman spectra of dyes and organic acids in silver solutions: chloride ion effect.
Authors:['Li YS', 'Cheng J', 'Wang Y']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA. yingli@cc.memphis.edu
Abstract:We have recorded surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectra of two different classes of compounds, cationic dyes and organic acids, and studied their chloride ion effects on the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activities of the silver solution. For the positive charge dyes, rhodamine 6G (R6G) and 1,1'-dimethyl-2,2'-cyanine iodide (DECI), no SERS could be observed without the addition of chloride ions because of lack of the electrostatic interaction between the dye species and the silver particles in the silver solution. The chloride ions served to enlarge silver particles and to contribute the existence of the surface active sites, making the silver solution SERS active to the dye samples. Surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) intensity of the dye molecules increased with the chloride ion concentration. After reaching a maximum intensity, a Cl- quenching effect on the intensity took place. For the organic acids, benzoic acid and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), SERS could be observed without the coexistence of chloride ions. The intensity of the Raman scattering did not vary significantly in the presence of small amount of chloride ion. At high Cl- concentration, quenching SERS intensity began to take effect.

Title:Toward standardization of methods of determination of fracture properties of acrylic bone cement and statistical analysis of test results.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Nyman JS']

Abstract:A succinct critical review of the literature on the fatigue, fatigue crack propagation, and fracture toughness (herein collectively termed "fracture properties") of acrylic bone cement is presented, whereby it is pointed out that a plethora of test conditions have been used. This situation precludes meaningful interstudy comparisons and mitigates against a definitive delineation of the effect of a named variable on a specified fracture property. A case for standardization of test conditions is thus made, culminating in the presentation of a recommended set of such conditions. In addition, it is shown that many literature parametric studies employed inappropriate statistical methods for performing pairwise comparisons, and all these studies have not addressed the issue of possible interactions between the parameters being investigated. A methodology for addressing these deficiencies is presented in the present report, and its use is illustrated with a set of notional fatigue test results.

Abstract:Mature rats were given lesions of the hippocampus (HIPPO), subiculum (SUBIC) or fimbria-fornix (FIFO) and then received the mild chronic stressors of food deprivation and isolation housing for ten months prior to testing. Group differences in circadian activity were investigated along with locomotion elicited by amphetamine (AMP 1.0-2.0 mg/kg i.p.) alone, and following the corticosterone (CORT) synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone (MET 10.0-25.0 mg/kg i.p.). Basal levels of plasma CORT, (ng/ml), plasma glucose (GLUC, mmol/l), thymic and splenic wet weights were subsequently determined along with complete blood counts (CBC). In comparison to age matched, unoperated controls, selective SUBIC lesions altered the circadian periodicity of locomotion, while rats with FIFO lesions were spontaneously hyperactive. Both HIPPO and FIFO animals showed significantly higher levels of amphetamine-induced locomotion. In all groups metyrapone significantly enhanced locomotion elicited by amphetamine, probably due to a pharmacokinetic interaction between these drugs. In comparison to controls, animals in the HIPPO group showed significant reductions in plasma glucose levels, decreased thymic wet weights and reductions in lymphocyte numbers, indicating lesion-related immuno-suppression. These findings highlight a functional difference among the effects of these specific hippocampal lesions on neural regulation of the HPA axis, under conditions of chronic mild stress, suggesting that the modulatory influence of the hippocampus on the stress axis is dependent on the neuroanatomical location and total extent of cell loss within this structure. They further suggest that the heightened response to amphetamine occurs independently of any lesion-induced changes in modulation of the HPA axis.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in resting energy expenditure (REE) between black and white smokers in order to determine whether REE might contribute to postcessation weight gain. DESIGN: Cross-sectional and prospective investigation of ethnic differences in REE. Differences in REE between black and white smokers were examined at baseline while all participants were smoking, and again during 2 weeks of abstinence from smoking. SETTING: Memphis, Tennessee, USA. SUBJECTS: Sixty-six black and 112 white smokers (age 30.4 y; cigarettes per day 21.4; weight 71.7 kg; body mass index 24.5 kg/m2). RESULTS: Black smokers had a significantly lower baseline REE after adjusting for gender and body weight. Changes in REE following smoking cessation did not differ by ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that black smokers may be more energy efficient, which could contribute to ethnic differences in postcessation weight gain.

Abstract:In vitro assays were used to characterize adhesion of human aortic, microvascular and umbilical vein endothelial cells to various forms of immobilized fibrinogen. All three types of endothelial cells adhered to fibrinogen in a manner that was independent of the Aalpha-chain 572-574 RGD cell binding site. In fact, all three adhered to a fragment of the molecule which is composed of only one D domain (D1) of fibrinogen. A time course study revealed that extensive adhesion of endothelial cells on the ligand coated surface occurred between one and two hours incubation. The anti-fibrinogen gammaA-chain monoclonal antibody 4A5 as well as 4A5 Fabs, blocked adhesion of endothelial cells to fibrinogen, not vitronectin. The inhibitory effects of 4A5 seemed to be indirect because the endothelial cells adhered to the recombinant fibrinogen gamma407 (which lacks the gamma-chain AGDV sequence of the carboxyl terminal 4A5 binding site) as well as they did to normal recombinant fibrinogen. A recombinant fibrinogen lacking the gamma-chain AGDV sequence, containing RGE in place of RGD at the gamma-chain 572-574 and 95-97 positions, also supported endothelial cell adhesion. The anti-alphavbeta3 antibody, LM609, blocked adhesion of endothelial cells to fibrinogen. The peptide GRGDSP inhibited endothelial cell adhesion on fibrinogen and vitronectin. These results demonstrate that alphavbeta3 mediated adhesion (attachment and spreading) of HUVECs to fibrinogen may use a site in the D domain of fibrinogen and is not dependent on the Aalpha-chain RGD (95-97 and 572-574) sequences, as has been shown in shorter term (where cells were rounded) experiments, or the alphaA-chain 408-411 cell binding sites. Thus, the data reveal the existence of another unidentified site(s) on fibrinogen which can support the irreversible adhesion (attachment and spreading) of endothelial cells.

Abstract:Surface-enhance Raman (SER) spectra of pyrazinamide (PZA), isoniazid (INAZ), and isonicotiamide (INCT) in silver sols have been studied over a range of solution concentration and pH. A linear calibration curve has been obtained for each of the sample molecules, and the lower limits of detection are estimated to be 5 ng for PZA and INAZ, and 10 ng for INCA. The variation of SER intensity with the sample solution pH is explained in terms of the charge of the sample species and the stability of the sols. The normal Raman and infrared spectra for the pure drug samples have also been collected, from which some vibration assignments for the molecules are given. The absorption behaviors of the molecules on the silver particle surfaces are also suggested.

Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN 38152-3180, USA.
Abstract:The present review contains salient features of the most widely used methods for depositing hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings on bioalloy substrates. These methods range from the ubiquitous plasma spraying in air to the recently introduced ion beam enhanced deposition technique. Special attention is paid to the residual stress in the coating that arises from various sources and whose magnitude impacts the adhesion of the coating to the substrate and, hence, the efficacy of the coated part (see, for example, the in vivo performance of HA-coated orthopaedic and dental implants). Thus, the plethora of methods for estimating residual stresses in HA-coated systems are critically examined. The review concludes with a detailed presentation of ten areas for future research work.

Title:Properties of crosslinked ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN 38152-3180, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:Substantially reducing the rate of generation of wear particles at the surfaces of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) orthopedic implant bearing components, in vivo, is widely regarded as one of the most formidable challenges in modern arthroplasty. In the light of this, much research attention has been paid to the myriad of endogenous and exogenous factors that have been postulated to affect this wear rate, one such factor being the polymer itself. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in crosslinking the polymer as a way of improving its properties that are considered relevant to its use for fabricating bearing components. Such properties include wear resistance, fatigue life, and fatigue crack propagation rate. Although a large volume of literature exists on the topic on the impact of crosslinking on the properties of UHMWPE, no critical appraisal of this literature has been published. This is one of the goals of the present article, which emphasizes three aspects. The first is the trade-off between improvement in wear resistance and depreciation in other mechanical and physical properties. The second aspect is the presentation of a method of estimating the optimal value of a crosslinking process variable (such as dose in radiation-induced crosslinking) that takes into account this trade-off. The third aspect is the description of a collection of under- and unexplored research areas in the field of crosslinked UHMWPE, such as the role of starting resin on the properties of the crosslinked polymer, and the in vitro evaluation of the wear rate of crosslinked tibial inserts and other bearing components that, in vivo, are subjected to nearly unidirectional motion.

Title:Interfacial study of benzenesulfinate chemisorbed on silver.
Authors:['Cao Y', 'Li YS', 'Tseng JL', 'Desiderio DM']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The oxidative stability of self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of thiols on silver was examined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). A benzenesulfinate (BS) monolayer on silver was also prepared and investigated with MALDI-TOF-MS and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The presence of sulfinate, sulfonate, and thiosulfonate fragment ions reveals that thiolate monolayers oxidize in the air. The relative abundance of C6H5SO2- and C6H5SO3- species in the mass spectra of the monolayer with different air-exposure times provides an estimation of the oxidation progress. In the vibrational spectrum, the large red shift of v(SOO-), combined with the lack of a shift of v(C-S) upon adsorption, indicates its bidentate O-coordination. The orientation of the confined molecules, based on the Raman surface selection rules, was derived from the preferential enhancement of the different functional groups. The benzene ring of BS was found almost normal to the metal surface as a result of the intermolecular forces; that geometry excludes the possibility of the pi-system of the benzene ring from participating as another binding site. The SER spectra of BS obtained via a selective etching process confirms these observations.

Abstract:A microfabricated amperometric microcell was designed and used for the determination of proline iminopeptidase (PIP) enzyme activity in 2-10-microl samples. The measurements were made in the range of 10.3-841.5 mU/ml enzyme activities. The sensitivity of the determinations was between - 0.0195 and - 0.0203 microA ml/mU per min. The coefficient of variation of the determined values ranged between 2.8 (at 561.2 mU/ml) and 24.1% (at 10.3 mU/ml). The microcell was manufactured on an alumina substrate using screen-printed graphite working and Ag/AgCl reference electrodes. Elevated PIP activity in the vaginal fluid is a biochemical indicator of bacterial vaginosis. The method is appropriate to differentiate between normal (66+/-145 mU/ml) and elevated, diseased (704+/-145 mU/ml), values.

Title:RNA: a method to specifically inhibit PCR amplification of known members of a multigene family by degenerate primers.

Affiliation:Department of Biochemistry, University of Tennessee, 858 Madison Avenue, Suite G01, Memphis, TN 38163, USA. pyuen@utmem.edu
Abstract:The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a versatile method to amplify specific DNA with oligonucleotide primers. By designing degenerate PCR primers based on amino acid sequences that are highly conserved among all known gene family members, new members of a multigene family can be identified. The inherent weakness of this approach is that the degenerate primers will amplify previously identified, in addition to new, family members. To specifically address this problem, we synthesized a specific RNA for each known family member so that it hybridized to one strand of the template, adjacent to the 3'-end of the primer, allowing the degenerate primer to bind yet preventing extension by DNA polymerase. To test our strategy, we used known members of the soluble, nitric oxide-sensitive guanylyl cyclase family as our templates and degenerate primers that discriminate this family from other guanylyl cyclases. We demonstrate that amplification of known members of this family is effectively and specifically inhibited by the corresponding RNAs, alone or in combination. This robust method can be adapted to any application where multiple PCR products are amplified, as long as the sequence of the desired and the undesired PCR product(s) is sufficiently distinct between the primers.

Abstract:Blood plasma and serum contain factors that activate inwardly rectifying GIRK1/GIRK4 K+ channels in atrial myocytes via one or more non-atropine-sensitive receptors coupled to pertussis-toxin-sensitive G-proteins. This channel is also the target of muscarinic M(2) receptors activated by the physiological release of acetylcholine from parasympathetic nerve endings. By using a combination of HPLC and TLC techniques with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight MS, we purified and identified sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP) and sphingosylphosphocholine (SPC) as the plasma and serum factors responsible for activating the inwardly rectifying K+ channel (I(K)). With the use of MS the concentration of SPC was estimated at 50 nM in plasma and 130 nM in serum; those concentrations exceeded the 1.5 nM EC(50) measured in guinea-pig atrial myocytes. With the use of reverse-transcriptase-mediated PCR and/or Western blot analysis, we detected Edg1, Edg3, Edg5 and Edg8 as well as OGR1 sphingolipid receptor transcripts and/or proteins. In perfused guinea-pig hearts, SPC exerted a negative chronotropic effect with a threshold concentration of 1 microM. SPC was completely removed after perfusion through the coronary circulation at a concentration of 10 microM. On the basis of their constitutive presence in plasma, the expression of specific receptors, and a mechanism of ligand inactivation, we propose that SPP and SPC might have a physiologically relevant role in the regulation of the heart.

Title:The FadR.DNA complex. Transcriptional control of fatty acid metabolism in Escherichia coli.

Abstract:In Escherichia coli, the expression of fatty acid metabolic genes is controlled by the transcription factor, FadR. The affinity of FadR for DNA is controlled by long chain acyl-CoA molecules, which bind to the protein and modulate gene expression. The crystal structure of FadR reveals a two domain dimeric molecule where the N-terminal domains bind DNA, and the C-terminal domains bind acyl-CoA. The DNA binding domain has a winged-helix motif, and the C-terminal domain resembles the sensor domain of the Tet repressor. The FadR.DNA complex reveals how the protein interacts with DNA and specifically recognizes a palindromic sequence. Structural and functional similarities to the Tet repressor and the BmrR transcription factors suggest how the binding of the acyl-CoA effector molecule to the C-terminal domain may affect the DNA binding affinity of the N-terminal domain. We suggest that the binding of acyl-CoA disrupts a buried network of charged and polar residues in the C-terminal domain, and the resulting conformational change is transmitted to the N-terminal domain via a domain-spanning alpha-helix.

Title:The effects of crude oil and the effectiveness of cleaner application following oiling on US Gulf of Mexico coastal marsh plants.

Abstract:Field studies were conducted in two different marsh habitats in Louisiana coastal wetlands to evaluate the effects of oiling (using South Louisiana Crude oil, SLC) and the effectiveness of a shoreline cleaner (COREXIT 9580) in removing oil from plant canopies. The study sites represented two major marsh habitats; the brackish marsh site was covered by Spartina patens and the freshwater marsh was covered by Sagittaria lancifolia. Field studies were conducted in each habitat using replicated 5.8 m2 plots that were subjected to three treatments; oiled only, oiled + cleaner (cleaner was used 2 days after oiling), and a control. Plant gas exchange responses, survival, growth, and biomass accumulation were measured. Results indicated that oiling led to rapid reductions in leaf gas exchange rates in both species. However, both species in 'oiled + cleaned' plots displayed improved leaf conductance and CO2 fixation rates. Twelve weeks after treatment initiation, photosynthetic carbon fixation in both species had recovered to normal levels. Over the short-term, S. patens showed more sensitivity to oiling with SLC than S. lancifolia as was evident from the data of the number of live shoots and above-ground biomass. Above-ground biomass remained significantly lower than control in S. patens under 'oiled' and 'oiled + cleaned' treatments while it was comparable to controls in S. lancifolia. These studies indicated that the cleaner removed oil from marsh grasses and alleviated the short-term impact of oil on gas exchange function of the study plants. However, use of cleaner had no detectable effects on above-ground biomass production or regeneration at the end of the first growing season in S. patens. Similarly, no beneficial effects of cleaner on carbon fixation and number of live shoots were apparent beyond 12 weeks in S. lancifolia.

Abstract:The analytical performance of amperometric microcells with different electrode geometries is compared for enzyme activity measurements. The microcells were fabricated with thin film photolithography or thick film screen-printing in four different designs. The cells made with the thin film process used flexible substrate with microelectrode array or a circular, disk-shaped working electrode. The screen-printed working electrodes had semicircle or disk shape on ceramic chips. Putrescine oxidase (PUO) activity measurement was used as a model. The determination of PUO activity is important in the clinical diagnosis of premature rupture of the amniotic membrane. An electropolymerized m-phenylenediamine size-exclusion layer was used to eliminate common interferences. The size exclusion layer revealed also to be advantageous in protecting the electrodes from fouling by putrescine (enzyme substrate). The electrode fouling of bare electrodes was insignificant for screen-printed electrodes, but very severe for electroplated platinum working electrodes. The microelectrode array electrodes demonstrated smaller RSD and higher normalized sensitivities for hydrogen peroxide and PUO activity. All the other electrodes were demonstrating comparable analytical performances.

Title:Multiple-joint velocity-spectrum strength/power development consequent to repetition manipulation.
Authors:['Weiss LW', 'Relyea GE']
Affiliation:Musculoskeletal Dynamics Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA. lweiss@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Various repetition strategies are employed in typical weight-training programs. Strength is purportedly best developed using relatively few repetitions against great resistance. Strength in this context has typically been measured isotonically (dynamic constant external resistance or DCER) by performing a one-repetition maximum (1 RM). Multiple-joint isokinetic (velocity controlled) strength assessments are now available which may enable us to emulate movement patterns and velocities with those occurring in everyday activities while providing us with force and power information that heretofore has been difficult to obtain. Therefore, we assessed the effects of various repetition schemes during heavy-resistance training on multiple-joint isokinetic performance. METHODS. SETTING: Volunteers participated in 12 weeks (36 sessions) of variable-resistance weight training (8 different exercises) in one of the following programs: I-3 sets x 3-4 RM; II-3 x 9-10 RM; III-3 x 15-16 RM; IV, control. PARTICIPANTS: 48 apparently-healthy young men (18 to 34 years of age, X = 23.2) who had not participated in systematic heavy-resistance training during the previous year. MEASURES: Pre and post velocity-spectrum tests were conducted for both the squat (0.41, 0.65, 0.90, 1.14, and 1.39 m x s(-1) and bench press (0.50, 0.79, 1.09, 1.39 and 1.69 m x s-1) at which time peak force and peak power were measured. Force and power measurements were adjusted to control for body weight (N/kg and W/kg, respectively). Change (delta) scores were used for comparisons. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA s indicated that when compared to controls, improvements in force were significantly (p < 0.05) greater only at the slowest velocity (squats: Group II > Control; bench presses: Groups I, II, III > Control). However, changes in power were significantly (p < 0.05) greater than for controls at all 5 velocities tested (squats: Groups I, II > Control; bench presses: Groups I, II > Control except at 1.69 m x sec-1) where only Group I > Control). CONCLUSIONS: Due to the mixed findings for force improvements consequent to the various repetition schemes, conclusions are somewhat tentative. It appears, however, that strength increases only for slow velocities in young, previously untrained men consequent to 3 months of a relatively wide range of RM schemes using variable-resistance equipment. Power, on the other hand, appears to increase in the same subjects across a velocity spectrum for both squats and bench presses when no more than 10 RM are performed per set.

Title:Validation of the SADL questionnaire.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To cross-validate the psychometric characteristics of the Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life (SADL) questionnaire (Cox & Alexander, 1999), and to explore the SADL's construct validity. DESIGN: Thirteen private practice Audiology clinics each distributed SADL questionnaires, by mail, to 20 adults who had recently obtained hearing aids. The completed questionnaires were returned to a central site and subject anonymity was assured. There were 196 usable responses. RESULTS: Psychometric characteristics of the items were found to be very similar to those reported previously. Thus, the internal validity of the instrument was strongly supported. The assumption that the SADL quantifies satisfaction by assessing its components was evaluated by examining the relationship between SADL scores and scores on a traditional single-item satisfaction measure. A logical and statistically significant relationship was seen between the two measures, thereby supporting the construct validity of both types of data. For private-pay clients, satisfaction scores were very similar to the interim norms published by Cox and Alexander (1999). However, clients whose hearing aids were partly or fully purchased by insurance or benefits programs tended to be more satisfied than interim norms for third-party pay clients derived 5 yr ago. For most types of clients, there was a tendency toward more satisfaction in the Negative Features subscale than observed in our previous research. CONCLUSIONS: Both construct and internal validity of the SADL questionnaire were supported by this research. The previously published interim norms appear to be mostly appropriate for private-pay clients, but might require adjustment in the Negative Features subscale. Further research is needed to explore the relationship between satisfaction and device purchase issues (third-party versus private pay).

Title:Personal and professional factors and suicide intervention skills.
Authors:['Neimeyer RA', 'Fortner B', 'Melby D']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. neimeyer@memphis.edu
Abstract:This research investigated the relationship of professional and personal factors to the ability of counselors to respond appropriately to suicidal verbalizations using the Suicide Intervention Response Inventory (SIRI). Level of training, experience with suicidal clients, and death acceptance were positively related to suicide intervention competencies. A personal history of suicidality and a belief that suicide is a personal right were negatively related to such skills. Regression analysis revealed that personal history of suicidality and attitude toward suicide as a personal right accounted for a modest, but significant, percentage of the variance in SIRI scores, beyond that accounted for by professional factors. Post hoc analysis indicated that the negative relationship between personal history of suicidal behaviors and suicide counseling skills was significant in the professionally trained participants. These results highlight the importance of attitudes toward suicide and personal history of suicidality, as well as training and experience, in effectively counseling potentially suicidal clients.

Abstract:In order to better understand the role of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in physiology and pathophysiology, it is necessary to accurately determine the molecular species and amounts of LPA in biological samples. We have developed a stable-isotope dilution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay for the direct quantitative analysis of 1-acyl-LPA. This method utilizes a deuterium-labeled internal standard, LPA (18:0-d(35)), and a single liquid-liquid extraction with acidic butanol that allows >95% recovery of LPA, followed by online normal-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. This protocol allows for the accurate, sensitive, and reproducible analysis of the individual 1-acyl-LPA species present in biological samples. The utility of the assay is demonstrated through the analysis of LPA species in plasma and serum from human volunteers. Total LPA in EDTA plasma was 0.61 +/- 0.14 microM in males and 0.74 +/- 0.17 microM in females, which increased to 0.91 +/- 0.23 and 0.99 +/- 0.38 microM after incubation for 24 h at 25 degrees C. Total LPA in serum was 0.85 +/- 0.22 microM in males and 1.57 +/- 0.56 microM in females, which increased to 4.78 +/- 0.89 and 5.57 +/- 0.73 microM after incubation for 24 h at 25 degrees C.

Abstract:Adequate calcium intake is integral to bone health as well as for optimal athletic performance. This study was conducted to investigate: (a) food sources of calcium in a sample of collegiate athletes, (b) gender and/or ethnic differences in food sources of calcium, and (c) whether athletes that derive less of their calcium intake from dairy sources increase their calcium intake from supplements or other food sources. Participants were African-American and Euro-American NCAA Division 1-A athletes. Eighty-five men and 59 women participated. Calcium intake for the previous 7-day period was assessed with a brief calcium screen. Men consumed significantly more calcium than women (1,354 vs. 898 mg/day), with female cross-country runners exhibiting the lowest average intake (605 mg/day). Both men and women obtained the majority of their calcium from dairy products and mixed dishes, while men consumed significantly more calcium-fortified foods. Several gender and ethnic interactions for calcium intake from food groups were found. Mean total dairy calcium intake was found to vary according to total calcium intake in men, and supplemental calcium was not used to augment low dairy intakes of calcium in any group. While African-Americans and Euro-Americans athletes were consuming similar levels of calcium, the female athletes in the sample did not get adequate amounts.

Affiliation:Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:Invasive infections caused by non-type b encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae have increased recently. Because capsule is a major virulence factor, capsulation of 62 recently isolated non-serotype b encapsulated strains was examined. Repeated serotyping confirmed only 69.0% of isolates. The combination of slide agglutination and cap genotyping confirmed 78.9% of type a, 100% of type e, and 86.4% of type f strains. Seven nonencapsulated strains may have lost capsulation through homologous recombination. Three strains that could not be serotyped or genotyped failed to hybridize with any cap probe and are probably nontypeable H. influenzae. Of isolates that retained an intact cap locus, 62.2% had evidence of cap amplification. The epidemiology of non-type b encapsulated H. influenzae infections is complicated by the poor specificity of available serologic reagents and by spontaneous capsule loss. Recently isolated invasive non-type b encapsulated H. influenzae frequently have cap amplification, which may contribute to their virulence.

Abstract:The diploid chromosome number of the cotton boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis Boheman, is 44. Both C- and N-banding techniques of mitotic cells demonstrated constitutive heterochromatin in the p arm of the eight largest chromosomes, the p arm of the X chromosome, and the centromeric region of autosomal groups A-D. Neither the y nor the group E autosomes appeared to contain constitutive heterochromatin. Supernumerary chromosomes were not found in the boll weevil. Restriction endonuclease banding of primary spermatocytes revealed a rod-shaped Xy tetrad in which the X and y were terminally associated. The p arm of the large, submetacentric X was C-band positive. While two of the autosomal tetrads were typically ring-shaped in primary spermatocytes, the remaining 19 autosomal tetrads were rod-shaped.

Abstract:Irinotecan, 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11) is activated by carboxylesterases (CE) to yield the potent topoisomerase I inhibitor, SN-38. We have demonstrated previously that a rabbit liver CE is approximately 100-1000-fold more efficient at drug activation than a highly homologous human CE. In an attempt to use rabbit CE expression in combination with CPT-11 for gene therapy approaches for the treatment of cancer, we have developed an adenoviral vector expressing this intracellular CE. After transduction, this virus produces very high levels of CE activity in a panel of human tumor cell lines and results in marked sensitization to CPT-11 of all of the transduced cells. Reductions in IC(50) values for this drug ranged from 11-127-fold. Additionally, comparison with an adenovirus expressing a secreted form of the rabbit CE indicated that a collateral effect could be achieved with reductions in the IC(50) values ranging from 4-19-fold. These data suggest that the described reagents may be suitable for use in vivo in a viral-directed enzyme prodrug therapy approach using CPT-11.

Abstract:Tumor cells that contaminate hematopoietic cell preparations contribute to the relapse of neuroblastoma patients who receive autologous stem cell rescue as a component of therapy. Therefore, effective purging methods are needed. This study details in vitro experiments to develop a viral-directed enzyme prodrug purging method that specifically targets neuroblastoma cells. The approach uses an adenovirus to deliver the cDNA encoding a rabbit liver carboxylesterase that efficiently activates the prodrug irinotecan,7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11). The data show that an adenoviral multiplicity of infection of 50 transduces 100% of cultured neuroblastoma cells and primary tumor cells, irrespective of the level of tumor cell line contamination. Exposure of neuroblastoma cell lines or of mixtures of these cell lines with CD34(+) cells at a ratio of 10:90 to replication-deficient AdRSVrCE for 24 h and subsequent exposure of cells to 1-5 microM CPT-11 for 4 h increased the toxicity of CPT-11 to three neuroblastoma cell lines (SJNB-1, NB-1691, and SK-N-SH) from approximately 20-50-fold and eradicated their clonogenic potential. Also, after "purging," RNA for neuroblastoma cell markers (tyrosine hydroxylase, synaptophysin, and N-MYC) was undetectable by reverse transcription-PCR. In contrast, the purging protocol did not affect the number or type of colonies formed by CD34(+) cells in an in vitro progenitor cell assay. No bystander effect on CD34(+) cells was observed. The method described is being investigated for its potential clinical utility, particularly its efficacy for use with patients having relatively high tumor burdens, because no published methods have been shown to be efficacious when the tumor burden exceeds 1%.

Title:Photoacoustic calorimetry and quantum yields of Mo(CO)(6) ligand exchange in linear alkanes: determination of volume of reaction, energetics, and kinetics of nucleophile displacement of alkane from Mo(CO)(5)(alkane).

Abstract:Photoacoustic calorimetry (PAC) and actinometry studies were used to determine the enthalpies and volumes of reaction for the production of a transient intermediate, Mo(CO)(5)-alkane, and for its subsequent reaction with tetrahydrofuran (THF). Both the enthalpy and the volume of reaction contribute to the photoacoustic signal and have been resolved by changing the solvent thermal expansion properties with a series of linear alkanes. The enthalpies for substitution of CO on Mo(CO)(6) by an alkane and of coordinated alkane on Mo(CO)(5)(alkane) by THF are 30 and -14 kcal/mol, respectively. Likewise, the volumes of reaction are 18 and -1 mL/mol. From available data for the Mo--CO bond energy, these results allow the calculation of the Mo-alkane and Mo-THF bond energies (11 and 25 kcal/mol, respectively). The Mo-alkane result is 7 kcal/mol less than that from our previous PAC study, which ignored the volume of reaction, and is in better agreement with the results of kinetic studies. The large absolute difference in the reaction volumes for each step is partially attributed to a void volume created during the formation of the Mo--THF bond. In general, the volume of reaction cannot be neglected in the calculation of enthalpies of ligand substitution from PAC studies. The quantum yields for photosubstitution of Mo(CO)(6), in contrast to Cr(CO)(6), were found to be insensitive to the chain length of the alkane solvent.

Title:Searching for the meaning of meaning: grief therapy and the process of reconstruction.
Authors:['Neimeyer RA']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Tennessee, USA. neimeyer@memphis.edu
Abstract:A comprehensive quantitative review of published randomized controlled outcome studies of grief counseling and therapy suggests that such interventions are typically ineffective, and perhaps even deleterious, at least for persons experiencing a normal bereavement. On the other hand, there is some evidence that grief therapy is more beneficial and safer for those who have been traumatically bereaved. Beginning with this sobering appraisal, this article considers the findings of C.G. Davis, C.B. Wortman, D.R. Lehman, and R.C. Silver (this issue) and their implications for a meaning reconstruction approach to grief therapy, arguing that an expanded conception of meaning is necessary to provide a stronger basis for clinical intervention.

Title:Grief therapy and research as essential tensions: prescriptions for a progressive partnership.
Authors:['Neimeyer RA']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Tennessee, USA. neimeyer@memphis.edu
Abstract:Although the articles in this Special Series take an important step toward fostering mutually respectful dialogue between thanatological research and practice, many impediments still stand in the way of the continuation of the conversation. This closing coda therefore offers several prescriptions for sustaining a constructive exchange between the two domains, in the hope that a more artful and empirically informed grief therapy might yet take shape that embodies the unique strengths of each perspective.

Title:Soluble tubulin complexes in oocytes of the common leopard frog, Rana pipiens, contain gamma-tubulin.
Authors:['Lessman CA', 'Kim H']
Affiliation:Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-6041, USA. Clessman@memphis.edu
Abstract:Oocytes of the leopard frog, Rana pipiens, contain soluble tubulin which was previously shown to exist predominantly in megadalton (MDa) fractions and that fails to readily assemble in vitro. In order to further characterize these tubulin complexes, DEAE Sepharose chromatography, Sephacryl S-300 size exclusion columns and specific immunoprecipitation were used. The results revealed the presence of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-tubulin associated with several other proteins in the soluble fraction of Rana pipiens ovarian oocytes. These Rana oocyte tubulin complexes appear to be analogous to those recently reported in Xenopus ovulated eggs as gamma-tubulin ring complexes. This seems true since both size (estimates, i.e. approximately 2MDa) and protein components are similar. Furthermore, both alpha- and gamma-tubulin antibodies immunoprecipitated identical protein bands from Rana oocyte soluble fraction. These putative Rana gamma-tubulin ring proteins include 107, 97, 95, 90 and 75 kDa components which are similar in size to those found in Xenopus and other species. Rana appears to belong to a select group in which gamma-tubulin complexes contain significant alpha- and beta-tubulin (i.e., Xenopus and sheep), while other species such as Drosophila, Aspergillus, Saccharomyces, human cells and many other mammalian cells tested lack the other tubulin components. The heterogeneity in both size and protein components of Rana oocyte gamma-tubulin ring complexes may reflect different states of tubulin complex assembly. The lower vertebrate oocyte is hypothesized to act as a repository and prestaging point for the assembly of gamma-tubulin ring complexes which will become the maternal contribution to the centrosomes of the embryo. While the gamma-tubulin ring complexes of vertebrate eggs have been described previously, this is the first report biochemically characterizing soluble gamma-tubulin complexes in vertebrate ovarian oocytes.

Title:Short-chain phosphatidates are subtype-selective antagonists of lysophosphatidic acid receptors.

Abstract:Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) are members of the phospholipid growth factor family. A major limitation in the field to date has been a lack of receptor subtype-specific agonists and antagonists. Here, we report that dioctylglycerol pyrophosphate and dioctylphosphatidic acid are selective antagonists of the LPA(1) and LPA(3) receptors, but prefer LPA(3) by an order of magnitude. Neither molecule had an agonistic or antagonistic effect on LPA(2) receptor. Consistent with this receptor subtype selectivity, dioctylglycerol pyrophosphate inhibited cellular responses to LPA in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, HEY ovarian cancer cells, PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, and Xenopus laevis oocytes. Responses elicited by S1P in these cell lines that endogenously express S1P(1), S1P(2), S1P(3), and S1P(5) receptors were unaffected by dioctylglycerol pyrophosphate. Responses evoked by the G protein-coupled receptor ligands acetylcholine, serotonin, ATP, and thrombin receptor-activating peptide were similarly unaffected, suggesting that the short-chain phosphatidates are receptor subtype-specific lysophosphatidate antagonists.

Title:Effect of crosslinking UHMWPE on its tensile and compressive creep performance.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Carroll M']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-3180, USA.
Abstract:The in vitro quasi-static tensile and compressive creep properties of three sets of GUR 1050 ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) specimens were obtained. These sets were: control (as-received stock); "low-gamma" (specimens were crosslinked using gamma radiation, with a minimum dose of 5 Mrad); and "high-gamma" (specimens were crosslinked using gamma radiation, with a minimum dose of 15 Mrad). The % crystallinity (%C) and crosslink density (rho(x)) of the specimens in the three sets were also obtained. It was found that, in both tension and compression, crosslinking resulted in a significant depreciation in the creep properties, relative to control. The trend in the creep results is explained in terms of the impact of crosslinking on the polymer's %C and rho(x). The present results are in contrast to literature reports that show that crosslinking enhances the wear resistance of the polymer. The implications of the present results, taken together with the aforementioned literature results, are fully discussed vis-a-vis the use of crosslinked UHMWPE for fabricating articular components for arthroplasties.

Title:Distinct domains of alphaIIbbeta3 support different aspects of outside-in signal transduction and platelet activation induced by LSARLAF, an alphaIIbbeta3 interacting peptide.
Authors:['Derrick JM', 'Shattil SJ', 'Poncz M', 'Gruppo RA', 'Gartner TK']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The peptide LSARLAF causes alphaIIbeta3-dependent platelet activation exemplified by secretion, aggregation, spreading and adhesion on fibrinogen, and tyrosine phosphorylation. alphaIIIbeta3-dependent outside-in signal transduction induced by LSARLAF was investigated in variant thrombasthenic platelets which lack most of the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin beta3 subunit (alphaIIbbeta3 delta724). These studies revealed that only certain aspects of this alphaIIbbeta3-dependent outside-in signaling were affected by the beta3 truncation. Specifically, alphaIIbbeta3 delta724 supported LSARLAF-induced platelet aggregation, agglutination and secretion, but failed to trigger cytoskeletal reorganization and platelet spreading on fibrinogen, despite the fact that PMA-induced non alphaIIbbeta3 mediated signaling caused spreading of these platelets on fibrinogen. Thus, distinct domains of alphaIIbbeta3 are required to support different aspects of LSARLAF-induced platelet activation. Furthermore, these studies suggest that not all alphaIIbbeta3-dependent platelet responses require an intact beta3 cytoplasmic tail.

Title:Evaluation of a Revised Speech in Noise (RSIN) test.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Gray GA', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and School of Audiology and Speech Pathology, The University of Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:A revised version of the Speech in Noise (SIN) test was developed by reallocating the recorded test material on the compact disc into different lists (blocks). The goal was to increase the equivalence and reliability of the test blocks to enhance their usefulness in research settings. The Revised Speech in Noise test has four blocks of sentences. Each block comprises twice as many sentences as in the original SIN test. There are also practice sentences for each condition. Forty-two elderly subjects with normal hearing for their age and gender provided data on the equivalence of the new test blocks. The remaining inequalities in mean scores were mostly eliminated using score weighting. Critical differences were developed to promote interpretation of scores from the same individual under different conditions. The revisions substantially improved the equivalence of test blocks and their sensitivity to performance changes. Increased test time is the associated drawback.

Abstract:A new chronoamperometric method is used to estimate changes in the membrane composition of mobile-site, ionophore-based membranes. The characteristic features of the chronoamperometric curves (initial current, slope, break time) of valinomycin-based, potassium-selective membranes loaded with potassium tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl)borate are correlated with the mobile-site and free ionophore concentration in the membrane. limiting cases for strong and negligible ion pair formation are distinguished. Replicate measurements indicate a relative standard deviation in the calculated values less than 10%. The practical applicability of the method was tested with membranes incorporated into conventional ion-selective electrode bodies or cast onto microfabricated planar sensor structures.

Abstract:From a postmodern standpoint, all trust is ultimately unfounded, in the sense that no authoritative theoretical, empirical or practical foundation exists to ground a unified, explicit, and justified framework for psychotherapeutic practice. Following a constructivist meditation on these themes, I offer five playful prescriptions for addressing this predicament that suggest a provisional way forward in a terrain that offers no firm footholds having bedrock certainty.

Title:A meta-analysis of the effects of cigarette smoking on bone mineral density.
Authors:['Ward KD', 'Klesges RC']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis Center for Community Health, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:To determine the magnitude and mediators of the association between cigarette smoking and bone mass in the epidemiologic literature we reviewed articles, published abstracts, and conference proceedings, identified through MEDLINE, psychological abstracts, conference proceedings, and article bibliographies. We studied cross-sectional and prospective human studies that provided a quantitative measure of bone mass (X-ray, absorptiometry, or computed tomography) as a function of cigarette smoking exposure. Effects were expressed as pooled standardized mean differences for categorical comparisons (e.g., bone mass in current versus nonsmokers), and as pooled correlation coefficients for continuous comparisons (e.g., correlation of bone mass and pack-years of smoking). Effects were derived for combined bone sites (all bone sites pooled within each study) and four specific sites (hip, lumbar spine, forearm, and os calcis), and were examined overall and as a function of subject and methodologic characteristics (gender, age, body weight, menopausal status, health status). Data were pooled across 86 studies, enrolling 40,753 subjects. Smokers had significantly reduced bone mass compared with nonsmokers (never and former smokers) at all bone sites, averaging a one-tenth standard deviation (SD) deficit for combined sites. Deficits were especially pronounced at the hip, where the bone mass of current smokers was one-third of a SD less than that of never smokers. Overall, effects were greatest in men and in the elderly, and were dose-dependent. In prospective studies, smokers had greater rates of bone loss over time compared with nonsmokers. Bone mass differences remained significant after controlling for age and body weight differences between the two groups. Absolute effect sizes at most bone sites were greatest for current smokers compared with never smokers, intermediate for current smokers compared with former smokers, and lowest for former smokers compared with never smokers, suggesting that smoking cessation may have a positive influence on bone mass. Based on these data, it is estimated that smoking increases the lifetime risk of developing a vertebral fracture by 13% in women and 32% in men. At the hip, smoking is estimated to increase lifetime fracture risk by 31% in women and 40% in men. It appears that smoking has an independent, dose-dependent effect on bone loss, which increases fracture risk, and may be partially reversed by smoking cessation. Given the public health implications of smoking on bone health, it is important that this information be incorporated into smoking prevention and cessation efforts.

Title:Effects of adenovirus-mediated liver-selective overexpression of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1b on insulin sensitivity in vivo.
Authors:['Wang J', 'Cheung AT', 'Kolls JK', 'Starks WW', 'Martinez-Hernandez A', 'Dietzen D', 'Bryer-Ash M']

Abstract:AIM: Protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) is an intracellular PTP known to dephosphorylate and inactivate upstream tyrosine phosphoproteins in the insulin signalling cascade. We and others reported increased abundance of catalytically impaired PTP-1B in tissue lysates from obese human subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, while genetic knockout of PTP-1B improves insulin sensitivity and prevents nutritionally mediated insulin resistance and obesity. The aim of the present work was to further elucidate the role of PTP-1B in glucose metabolism in vivo. METHODS: We used adenoviral constructs incorporating cDNAs for either wild-type (W/T) or a catalytically inactive C(215)S (C/S) mutant PTP-1B to achieve liver-selective PTP-1B overexpression in young Sprague-Dawley rats using tail vein injection, based on the high degree of hepatotropism of adenovirus 5 (Ad5). An Ad5-lacZ construct encoding beta-galactosidase was used as a control for viral effects alone. A hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp was used to study whole body glucose disposal and endogenous glucose production rates. RESULTS: Control studies in HIRcB cells confirmed catalytic activity and inactivity of W/T and C/S respectively. Mean PTP-1B abundance was 2.24 +/- 0.02- and 2.33 +/- 0.04-fold of saline-treated control in liver lysates of W/T and C/S rats respectively. Liver selective overexpression was confirmed by analysis of tissue lysates from liver, fat and muscle tissues. Ad5 treatment did not result in a statistically or clinically significant liver injury, as determined by serum alanine aminotransferase and histological examination. Seven days post injection, no significant difference in rate of weight gain, fasting blood glucose or insulin levels were seen in any group. Similarly, under steady-state glucose clamp conditions, glucose disposal rate (R(d)), endogenous glucose production rate (EGP) and serum insulin levels were similar in all groups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that moderate medium-term overabundance, to a degree resembling that seen in insulin-resistant states, of PTP-1B in liver tissue does not alter insulin action on glucose metabolism and that the major site of action of PTP-1B is presumably at insulin-responsive target tissue or tissues other than the liver.

Affiliation:Human Performance Laboratories, The University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Nine men (25.11 +/- 1.16 years) performed 3 different test sessions. In the control session, subjects performed a 10-second sprint cycle test and 1 repetition maximum (1RM) in the back squat. The 5-minute test session consisted of 10 x 1 repetition in the parallel back squat exercise at 90% of their 1RM, 5 minutes of rest, and then a 10-second sprint cycle test. The 20-minute test session consisted of the same test protocol as the 5-minute test session except that the subjects rested for 20-minutes prior to the sprint cycle test. Significant differences were found in average power and average power relative to body weight (F = 5.684, p = 0.014, and F = 1.258, p = 0.006, respectively) for the 5-minute test session. The authors conclude that this particular squat protocol could have a potential carry-over effect into improvements in 100-m sprint times when performing the squats 5-minutes prior to performance.

Title:Disabled-1 interacts with a novel developmentally regulated protocadherin.
Authors:['Homayouni R', 'Rice DS', 'Curran T']
Affiliation:Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.
Abstract:Disabled-1 (Dab1) is an intracellular adapter protein that mediates the effect of Reelin on neuronal migration and cell positioning during mammalian brain development. To identify components of the Reelin-Dab1 signaling pathway, we searched for proteins that interact with Dab1 using a yeast two-hybrid strategy. We found that the Dab1 phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain interacts with a novel protocadherin, orthologous to human protocadherin 18. Mouse Pcdh18 (mPcdh18), which consists of four exons similar to other protocadherin family members, maps to chromosome 3. The deduced amino acid sequence of mPcdh18 contains six extracellular cadherin motifs, a single transmembrane region, and a large intracellular domain. The site of Dab1 interaction was localized to the C-terminal 243 residues of mPcdh18. Expression analyses revealed that mPcdh18 is present in a variety of tissues in the embryo, but in adult mice it is primarily expressed in lung and kidney. In embryonic brain, mPcdh18 expression is temporally and spatially regulated. Our results indicate that mPcdh18 participates in signaling pathways involving PTB-containing proteins and suggest that it may play a role during brain development.

Title:Conformational changes in beta-endorphin as studied by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.
Authors:['Lin H', 'Dass C']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Because of a wide range of physiological functions, the structure of beta-endorphin (BE) is of great interest. In this study, conformational changes in BE induced by methanol are explored with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Differences in the charge-state distribution (CSD) and the extent of hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange were used to monitor the conformational changes. The latter experiments were conducted via time-resolved ESI-MS in a continuous-flow apparatus. Both these techniques demonstrate that BE exists in a random coil open structure in aqueous media, but it acquires a more compact conformation with increased concentration of methanol. The H/D exchange experiments reveal that BE forms 61% alpha-helix in mixed solvents.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Organized sport participation in youth is a common form of physical activity; yet, little is known about how it is associated with adult obesity and related health behaviors. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a history of youth sport participation was related to adult obesity, physical activity, and dietary intake among women. METHODS: Participating women (209 African American, 277 Caucasian; ages 18-39), recruited from the community, completed laboratory measures, a paper and pencil survey assessing past sport participation and current physical activity level, and dietary records. RESULTS: Linear regression revealed that a history of sport participation predicted lower adult body mass index and higher total and sport activity levels for both ethnic groups and higher work-related physical activity among Caucasians (all P < 0.001). Past sports participation did not predict dietary intake. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that girls' participation in sports may lay the foundation for adult health and health behaviors and that sports participation could be an important component of obesity prevention programs.

Abstract:The purpose of the present study was to investigate auditory stimulus feature processing and how neural generators might differ among the mismatch negativity (MMN) responses to intensity, frequency, and duration deviant stimuli. Data collected from 72 electrodes in twelve adult female subjects were analyzed. For each subject, peak amplitude and latency values at Fz were compared among responses to the three deviant stimulus types presented in individual conditions with a probability of 0.10 and 0.30, and in the multiple deviant condition in which all three deviant types were presented (design based on Deacon et al. 1998). Further, equivalent current dipoles (ECD) for each deviant type, in each condition, and for each subject were calculated in three areas: right hemisphere, left hemisphere, and frontal. Peak amplitude and latency measured at Fz were consistent with previous findings by Deacon et al. (1998) and suggested parallel processing, perhaps by separate neural generators. However, ECD locations were not significantly different among the responses to the different deviant types. Further, the ECD magnitudes did not consistently reflect the differences in amplitude observed at the scalp among responses to the deviant types and conditions. The latter finding may indicate that the procedures were not sensitive enough to identify true differences among the generators. Alternatively, it was suggested that searching for separate neural generators at the cortical level may be too restrictive because the process may begin in subcortical areas, as indicated in animal models.

Title:Verifying loudness perception after hearing aid fitting.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Gray GA']
Affiliation:The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:During the verification phase of a hearing aid fitting, clinicians often want to assess the extent to which loudness perceptions for amplified sounds are similar to those typical of normal hearers. This type of verification calls for a criterion for "normal" loudness perception of sounds presented in a sound field. This research sought to answer several questions about the parameters of a valid "normal" criterion for a verification procedure using the Contour test of loudness perception. Loudness data were obtained from 30 listeners with normal hearing. Results indicated that a loudness growth function obtained with earphone listening is not an appropriate normative reference for hearing aid fitting verification. Instead, the normative data should be based on sound field listening. Results also indicated that the same normative function could be used to assess both unilateral and bilateral fittings. Further, it is likely that the same normative function can be used for most frequency responses that are likely to be used in feasible fittings. Finally, it was found that a previously published normative function obtained using an automated test procedure was not faithfully replicated using a carefully executed fully manual test procedure. We concluded that, until a replicable normative function is established, practitioners will need to generate their own local norms to perform postfitting verification of loudness normalization.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: This study examined the relationship between community-level and school-level socioeconomic status indicators and current cigarette smoking among urban adolescents, and examined whether the socioeconomic status-cigarette smoking relationship was similar for African Americans and Whites. METHODS: Participants were 3,813 seventh-graders recruited in a large school system in the United States. Independent variables included median income and mean education within zip codes of participants' residence, percentage of participants receiving lunch at reduced or no cost at school level, and ethnicity. The dependent variable was current smoking status (never smoked vs smoking one or more cigarettes per month). RESULTS: Whites were significantly more likely than African Americans to smoke cigarettes. There was a main effect of education and lunch at reduced or no cost on cigarette smoking. Mean education by zip code was inversely associated with cigarette smoking, and lunch at reduced or no cost was directly associated with cigarette smoking. There was a significant interaction between income and ethnicity. Median income by zip code was directly associated with cigarette smoking among African Americans. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that smoking prevention efforts in this population should take both socioeconomic status and ethnicity into account.

Title:Explosive strength deficit as a predictor of vertical jumping performance.
Authors:['Weiss LW', 'Fry AC', 'Relyea GE']
Affiliation:Musculoskeletal Dynamics Lab, The University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. lweiss@memphis.edu.
Abstract:Currently, variables predictive of vertical jumping performance can account for only part of its total variability. A potential additional source of variation called explosive strength deficit (ESD) was described in 1995 by Zatsiorsky (Science and Practice of Strength Training. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics, 1995. pp. 34-35.). ESD is determined by measuring the maximum force generated under ideal circumstances (F(mm)) and under task-relevant conditions (F(m)). It is calculated as 100(F(mm) - F(m))/F(m). For this study, the following operational definitions were used: F(mm) = squatting peak force at 0.51 m x s(-1); F(m) = squatting peak force at 1.43 m x s(-1). Data were analyzed using forward stepwise multiple regression. Mean ESD for men was 29.7% (SD = 11.7) and for women was 49.3% (SD = 11.2). For men and women, respectively, zero-order correlations for ESD with restricted vertical jumping (RVJ) distance were -0.35 and -0.60, and between ESD and drop vertical jumping (DVJ) distance were -0.20 and -0.63. However, when the previously identified predictors were taken into account, ESD was not a significant predictor (p > 0.05) of either type of jump. Therefore, it was concluded that ESD on the basis of velocity-regulated squats does not augment the explained variance previously established for vertical jumping performance.

Title:Relationship between ultrastructure and the nanoindentation properties of intramuscular herring bones.
Authors:['Rho JY', 'Mishra SR', 'Chung K', 'Bai J', 'Pharr GM']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN 38152-3210, USA. jrho@cc.memphis.edu
Abstract:The nanoindentation technique was used to characterize the indentation modulus of intramuscular herring bone (Clupea harengus) along its length, from early to fully mineralized regions. Both the indentation modulus and modulus anisotropy ratio, indentation modulus longitudinally/indentation modulus transversely, increased nonmonotonically with mineralization, from 1.1 in the early stages of mineralization to 2.1 in the fully mineralized region. The indentation modulus in the fully mineralized region decreased from 19.9+/-2.0 GPa in the longitudinal direction to 11.4+/-1.5 GPa in the transverse directions. In the earliest stages of mineralization, the indentation modulus was 3.8+/-0.7 GPa in the longitudinal direction and 3.5+/-0.3 GPa in the transverse direction. High-intensity synchrotron x rays were used to examine two parameters of crystal texture, the coherence length and the angular spread. Low angular spread was seen along the c axis of bone crystallite. However, the large angular spread observed along the (300) plane indicated an imperfection of crystallite periodicity in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis in the bone. The relatively high coherence length was related to the low angular spread. In general, the indentation modulus increased with increasing crystallite size, but the indentation modulus decreased with increasing crystallite size along the (300) plane.

Title:Rheological properties of acrylic bone cement during curing and the role of the size of the powder particles.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Carroll M']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:A dynamic compressive rheometric technique was used to determine the true or complex viscosity (eta*) of three poly (methyl methacrylate), PMMA-based bone cement formulations (one commercially available and two experimental), as a function of the time that elapsed from commencement of hand mixing of the cement constituents (t). For each cement, two rheological parameters [namely, the time of onset of cure (t(ons)) and the critical cure rate (CCR), which is herein defined as the complex viscosity rate computed at t(ons)] were determined from the eta*-t data. For each cement, particle analysis was used to obtain the powder particle size distribution, from which the following parameters were obtained: (a) the overall mean particle diameter D(m), and (b) the relative amounts of small-sized PMMA beads (mean diameter d between 0 and 40 mum) (alpha) and large-sized PMMA beads (d > 75 mum) (beta). It is seen that the key particle parameter is not D(m) per se but alpha and beta. Thus, the highest values of t(ons) and CCR were obtained from a cement with the highest values of alpha and beta. An explanation for these trends is given, and two areas for further research work in this field are outlined.

Title:Adolescent reports of physician counseling for smoking.
Authors:['Alfano CM', 'Zbikowski SM', 'Robinson LA', 'Klesges RC', 'Scarinci IC']
Affiliation:University of Memphis Center for Community Health, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Physicians can play an important role in reducing adolescent smoking by counseling their adolescent patients. The appropriate delivery of smoking prevention and cessation messages depends on adequate screening of adolescents, identification of smokers, and adolescents' willingness to disclose their smoking. The present study assessed adolescent reports of physician screening and counseling and adolescents' willingness to disclose smoking, as well as demographic and health status differences in these rates. METHODS: Adolescents (n = 5016), ages 16 to 19, completed a survey on smoking and health. Reports of the prevalence of physician screening, counseling, and adolescents' willingness to disclose their smoking were examined, and logistic regression analyses assessed demographic and health status differences in these prevalence estimates. RESULTS: Overall, 43.4% of the sample reported physician screening, 42.1% reported receiving counseling, and only 28.8% of adolescents reported both. Furthermore, 79.3% of smokers reported that they would admit their smoking if asked. Screening, counseling, and disclosure rates differed by gender, neighborhood income level, smoking status, and asthma status. CONCLUSIONS: More intensive provider-delivered intervention is needed. Efforts should focus on helping providers to identify smoking correctly and to communicate appropriate prevention or cessation messages. Persistence and sensitivity with boys, experimental smokers, and youths with chronic health conditions should be a focus of provider training, because the lower willingness of these youths to disclose their smoking may be a barrier to their identification and intervention.

Abstract:PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefits of open lung biopsy in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary infiltrates in children who have undergone bone marrow transplantation. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients in whom pulmonary infiltrates developed within 6 months after bone marrow transplantation. Of 528 patients who received bone marrow transplants (313 allogeneic, 215 autologous) at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between June 1991 and December 1998, 83 (16%) had radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates after the procedure. Of these, 43 (52%) underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), 19 (23%) underwent open lung biopsy (OLB), 6 (7%) underwent needle biopsy, and 5 (6%) underwent transbronchial biopsy; 21 received medical therapy alone. The authors evaluated the outcome, culture results, histopathologic findings, radiographic findings, and clinical features of those who underwent OLB. RESULTS: The 19 patients ranged in age from 0.9 to 19.8 years (median, 11.4 years). Histopathologic studies indicated an infectious process in 6 patients (30%), bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) in 5 (26%), interstitial pneumonitis (IP) in 4 (21%), gangliosidosis in 1, and lymphocytic infiltrate in 1. Although the clinical plan was changed on the basis of the histopathologic diagnosis for 17 of the 19 patients (90%), improvement in outcome was seen in only 8 (47.5%) of these patients. Postoperative morbidity (30 days) was 47% and included prolonged intubation (7 patients), pneumothorax (2 patients), and pleural effusion (1 patient). The 30-day survival rate was 63.2% plus minus 10.6%. No patient with multisystem organ failure (MSOF), ventilator dependence, or a postoperative complication survived after OLB. CONCLUSIONS: Histopathologic analysis of OLB specimens is very accurate in determining the cause of pulmonary infiltrates in pediatric patients who have undergone BMT, but OLB may not improve patient outcome. Because the postoperative morbidity and mortality rates associated with OLB are high, careful patient selection is necessary. The mortality rates of patients with MSOF or ventilator dependence are particularly high; therefore, less-invasive alternatives for diagnosis of pulmonary lesions should be considered before OLB is performed.

Title:Role of the Src family kinase Lyn in TxA2 production, adenosine diphosphate secretion, Akt phosphorylation, and irreversible aggregation in platelets stimulated with gamma-thrombin.

Abstract:Members of the Src family of kinases are abundant in platelets. Although their localization is known, their role(s) in platelet function are not well understood. Lyn is a Src-family kinase that participates in signal transduction pathways elicited by collagen-related peptide; it has also been implicated through biochemical studies in the regulation of von Willebrand factor signaling. Here, we provide evidence that Lyn plays a role in gamma-thrombin activation of platelets. Unlike the wild-type platelets, platelets from Lyn-deficient mice do not undergo irreversible aggregation, produce thromboxane A2, or secrete adenosine diphosphate in response to submaximal gamma-thrombin concentrations that cause secretion-dependent irreversible aggregation. Phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, also requires a higher concentration of gamma-thrombin in Lyn-deficient platelets than in wild-type platelets. These findings demonstrate that Lyn signaling is required for thrombin induction of secretion-dependent platelet aggregation. Specifically, Lyn is required under these conditions to enable thrombin-induced TxA2 production and adenosine diphosphate secretion, necessary steps in secretion-dependent platelet aggregation.

Abstract:To develop simple electrochemical immunoassays, a screen printed amperometric microcell with graphite working and Ag/AgCl reference electrodes was tested for the determination of alkaline phosphatase enzyme (ALP) and anti-humanIgG conjugated ALP (alpha-hIgG-ALP) activity in 5-10 microl samples. To ensure reproducible, steady state conditions, the working electrode surface was coated with mass-transport controlling hydrogel layer. The kinetic response curves of the hydrogel coated electrodes were linear. In addition, the hydrogel layer reduced the nonspecific adsorption of the alpha-hIgG-ALP conjugate on the working electrode surface. The measurements were made in the range of 2 divided by 4000 mU ml(-1) enzyme activities using ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (AAP) as the enzyme substrate. AAP is commercially available, non-toxic and has excellent stability. The sensitivity of the determinations was about 71% of the sensitivity which could be achieved using p-aminophenylphosphate (PAPP), a not easily accessible and unstable enzyme substrate. The experimentally determined kinetic parameters of the ALP enzyme catalyzed reactions were the same with the bare and hydrogel layer coated electrodes.

Abstract:Invasive infections caused by non-type b encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae have increased in frequency in the last decade. This change prompted us to characterize the genetic relationships of 48 recently isolated invasive H. influenzae type a (Hia), e (Hie), and f (Hif) strains by comparison of restriction digest patterns (RDPs). Recent Hia isolates exhibited moderate genetic diversity, with the majority segregating into two major clonotypes. Recent Hie and, especially, Hif strains displayed considerably restricted genetic diversity. In particular, all but one Hif strain segregated into a single clonotype, and half of these isolates had identical RDPs. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the increased incidence of disease due to non-type b encapsulated H. influenzae reflects the emergence of hypervirulent clones, especially in the case of Hif. Alternatively, it is possible that non-type b encapsulated H. influenzae strains have limited overall genetic diversity.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence of smoking among youth with asthma and explore potential risk factors for smoking among these youth, compared with youth without asthma. METHODS: In March 1997, a questionnaire assessing risk factors for smoking was administered to students attending public high school in Memphis, Tennessee. The sample (n = 3234) ranged from 15 to 18 years of age, was predominately African-American (76.7%), and 56.7% female. Based on a single self-reported item, 15.7% of youth reported having asthma. Logistic regression analyses assessed asthma status differences in current smoking and the association between risk factors and smoking. RESULTS: Nearly 20% of youth reported current smoking. Adolescents with asthma (current or past) were nearly 1.5 times more likely to smoke than peers without asthma. The association between risk factors and current cigarette smoking was equivalent for youth regardless of whether they had asthma and did not differ for those youth with current vs. past asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that adolescents with or without asthma smoke for similar reasons. Research is needed to elucidate whether there are unique risk factors, not examined here, for smoking among adolescents with asthma. Smoking prevention and cessation programs are needed for youth with asthma.

Abstract:Gelatinase B is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family that efficiently cleaves gelatin, elastin, and types V and X collagen. To understand the contribution of the active site of the enzyme (amino acid residues 373-456) in these activities, we studied catalytic properties of a fusion protein consisting of maltose binding protein and the active site region of gelatinase B. We found that addition of the active site of gelatinase B, which corresponds to 12% of the total protein molecule, to maltose binding protein is sufficient to endow the protein with the ability to cleave the peptide substrates Mca-PLGL(Dpa)AR-NH(2) and DNP-PLGLWA-(D)-R-NH(2). The fusion protein hydrolyzed the Mca-PLGL(Dpa)AR-NH(2) peptide with the same efficiency as that of the stromelysin, k(cat)/K(m) approximately 1.07 x 10(6) M(-)(1) h(-)(1). The fusion protein, however, was not able to degrade the large substrate, gelatin. Inhibition of the activity of the protein by EDTA suggested that its activity was metal dependent. ESR analyses indicated that the fusion protein bound one molecule of Zn(2+). In addition, Z-Pro-Leu-Gly-hydroxamate and TIMP-1 inhibited the activity of the protein, suggesting that the structure of the active site of the fusion protein is similar to that of the other metalloproteinases. These data provide fundamental information about the structural elements required for transforming a protein to a metalloprotease.

Title:Expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein and glutamine synthetase by Muller cells after optic nerve damage and intravitreal application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
Authors:['Chen H', 'Weber AJ']
Affiliation:Department of Pharmacology, University of Tennessee at Memphis, USA.
Abstract:Muller glia play an important role in maintaining retinal homeostasis, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has proven to be an effective retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neuroprotectant following optic nerve injury. The goal of these studies was to investigate the relation between optic nerve injury and Muller cell activation, and to determine the extent to which BDNF affects the injury response of Muller cells. Using immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis, temporal changes in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glutamine synthetase (GS) were examined in rats after optic nerve crush alone, or in conjunction with an intravitreal injection of BDNF (5 microg). GFAP protein levels were normal at 1 day post-crush, but increased approximately 9-fold by day 3 and remained elevated over the 2-week period studied. Muller cell GS expression remained stable after optic nerve crush, but the protein showed a transient shift in its cellular distribution; during the initial 24-h period post-crush the GS protein appeared to translocate from the cell body to the inner and outer glial processes, and particularly to the basal endfeet located in the ganglion cell layer. BDNF alone, or in combination with optic nerve crush, did not have a significant effect on the expression of either GFAP or GS compared with the normal retina, or after optic nerve crush alone, respectively. The data indicate that although BDNF is a potent neuroprotectant in the vertebrate retina, it does not appear to have a significant influence on Muller cell expression of either GS or GFAP in response to optic nerve injury.

Abstract:Fragmentation reactions of sodium-cationized enkephalin peptides generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization were studied using post-source decay (PSD) with a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Several matrices and analyte-matrix sample preparation methods were evaluated for high-intensity ion currents that could last for the entire PSD analysis. A triple dried-droplet sample preparation procedure with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as the matrix was found to yield abundant longer-lasting ion signals of the peptide-Na(+) ion adducts. The principal decay product of these adduct ions is the [b(n-1) + Na + OH](+) ion, which provides an unambiguous identification of the C-terminal residue of a peptide. In some peptides, the loss of a second residue from the C-terminus is also observed. No other sequence-specific ions were observed.

Title:American and Swedish children's acquisition of vowel duration: effects of vowel identity and final stop voicing.
Authors:['Buder EH', 'Stoel-Gammon C']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, Tennessee 38105, USA.
Abstract:Vowel durations typically vary according to both intrinsic (segment-specific) and extrinsic (contextual) specifications. It can be argued that such variations are due to both predisposition and cognitive learning. The present report utilizes acoustic phonetic measurements from Swedish and American children aged 24 and 30 months to investigate the hypothesis that default behaviors may precede language-specific learning effects. The predicted pattern is the presence of final consonant voicing effects in both languages as a default, and subsequent learning of intrinsic effects most notably in the Swedish children. The data, from 443 monosyllabic tokens containing high-front vowels and final stop consonants, are analyzed in statistical frameworks at group and individual levels. The results confirm that Swedish children show an early tendency to vary vowel durations according to final consonant voicing, followed only six months later by a stage at which the intrinsic influence of vowel identity grows relatively more robust. Measures of vowel formant structure from selected 30-month-old children also revealed a tendency for children of this age to focus on particular acoustic contrasts. In conclusion, the results indicate that early acquisition of vowel specifications involves an interaction between language-specific features and articulatory predispositions associated with phonetic context.

Title:Human leucocyte antigen alloimmunization after bone marrow transplantation: an association with chronic myelogenous leukaemia.

Abstract:Platelet refractoriness due to human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alloimmunization is a significant risk to allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients. To identify factors contributing to this risk, we reviewed the records of 317 consecutive, paediatric, allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients at a single institution. The 6-year estimated cumulative incidence of platelet refractoriness due to HLA alloimmunization was 2.6% +/- 0.9%. The incidence among patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) 12.5% +/- 5.3% was significantly greater than that of other patients (1.1% +/- 0.6%, P < 0.001). Graft rejection (P = 0.003) and the number of platelet transfusions during the first 90 d after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (P = 0.0025) were also significantly associated with alloimmunization. The association with CML and with graft rejection was not seen among patients alloimmunized before transplantation. Eight patients developed alloimmunization, of whom three had mismatched grafts and four had unrelated grafts. Alloantibody specificities, identified in seven patients, were unrelated to host or graft major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Host recognition of alloantigens in transfused blood products, not graft-host recognition, therefore seems predominantly responsible for the alloimmunization. These results show that paediatric CML patients have a significantly increased risk of platelet refractoriness due to HLA alloimmunization after BMT. Identifying the mechanism for the increased alloimmunization risk may assist in the development of therapies to prevent platelet refractoriness.

Title:Lateralized reaching as dynamical symmetry breaking in the bushbaby (Otolemur garnettii): preliminary evidence.
Authors:['Cantalupo C', 'Ward JP', 'Franceschetti DR']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, USA. ccantal@rmy.emory.edu
Abstract:Eight bushbabies were subjected to an extensive series of hand preference trials in which they were required to reach for a raisin from a rotating platform approaching from the right- or left-hand side of their visual field. Three principal types of behavior were observed. Several individuals known to be stable in hand preference continued to show a strong preference for a single hand. Another group, including some previously categorized as stable, exhibited "ambidextrous" cross-body reaching behavior. One individual exhibited far more complex behavior, being ambidextrous at low and very high speeds but lateralized at intermediate speeds. A straightforward adaptation of the dynamical neural field theory of Schoner et al. (1997) provides a model allowing each type of behavior, except possibly the shift from lateralized behavior to ambidextrous behavior at high speed, which might nonetheless be accommodated with minor modification.

Title:Purification and characterization of apolipophorin III from immune hemolymph of Heliothis virescens pupae.
Authors:['Chung KT', 'Ourth DD']
Affiliation:Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Apolipophorin III (ApoLp-III) from Heliothis virescens pupae was purified by heat-treatment followed by Sephadex G-50 filtration and reverse phase-HPLC. The molecular mass of the purified ApoLp-III was determined as 17965.9+/-5 Da by mass spectrometry. The N-terminal sequence confirmed the protein as ApoLp-III with homology of 56-83% to other insect ApoLp-III molecules. The amino acid spatial arrangement of the predicted alpha-helix 1 of Heliothis ApoLp-III was nearly identical to that of the amphipatic alpha-helix 1 of Manduca sexta ApoLp-III. The absorption spectrum from 240-340 nm of the Heliothis ApoLp-III was the same as the UV spectra of ApoLp-III from Manduca sexta and Galleria mellonella, showing absorption maxima at 280, 268, 264 and 259 nm. These results indicated that the primary structure of ApoLp-III is conserved in lepidopterans. The Heliothis ApoLp-III was not a glycoprotein and showed hemagglutination activity against rabbit red blood cells. This hemagglutination activity was abolished by Tween 80, but not by six different carbohydrates. Hydrophobic interaction of ApoLp-III with red blood cells agreed with structural studies since ApoLp-III binds lipid through hydrophobic interaction after conformational change. Bacterial injection apparently increased the amount of ApoLp-III in immune hemolymph when compared with normal hemolymph, and may indicate that ApoLp-III plays a role in insect immunity.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To examine gender and ethnic differences in smoking and smoking cessation in a population of young adult military recruits. DESIGN: A self-administered survey of demographics, tobacco use, and other health risk behaviors was administered at the start of basic military training. SETTING: The study was conducted at Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas, where all U.S. Air Force recruits complete basic military training. SUBJECTS: All recruits who entered the U.S. Air Force between September 1995 and September 1996 participated in this study (n = 32,144; 100% participation rate). MEASURES: Recruits completed a written 53-item behavioral risk questionnaire. Measures examined in the present study included smoking status (ever having smoked a cigarette, current daily smoking, and quitting); demographics (ethnicity, gender, education, family income, and age); smoking history; and nicotine dependence. RESULTS: Rates of ever smoking, current daily smoking, and quitting were examined in multiple logistic regression analyses as a function of gender and ethnicity, controlling for age, education, and family income. Overall, 54% of recruits had ever smoked a cigarette and 24.9% smoked daily at the time of entry into basic military training. Smoking rates were highest among white and Native American recruits. Among whites, women were more likely to be a current daily smoker (31.6% vs. 29.4%; odds ratio [OR] = 1.18, 99% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.08-1.29). The opposite pattern was observed among African-Americans (5.6% vs. 9.8%, respectively; OR = .57; CI = .41-.79). Current smokers had low levels of nicotine dependence compared with the general population of U.S. smokers, but whites tended to be more dependent than other ethnic groups. Cessation rates were similar for men and women but differed according to ethnicity, ranging from 15% among whites to 23% among Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: These findings document important gender and ethnic differences in cigarette smoking among military recruits. Whites and Native Americans were more likely to smoke, less likely to quit, and more nicotine-dependent than other ethnic groups. Across gender/ethnicity groups, smoking rates were especially high among white women, with nearly one-third smoking daily until entry into basic training. Gender differences were not observed in cessation rates, but Hispanics were more likely than other ethnic groups to have quit smoking. The results highlight the need to develop effective cessation interventions for this population.

Abstract:Ligand recognition by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), as well as substrate recognition by enzymes, almost always shows a preference for a naturally occurring enantiomer over the unnatural one. Recognition of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by its receptors is an exception, as both the natural L (R) and unnatural D (S) stereoisomers of LPA are equally active in bioassays. In contrast to the enantiomers of LPA, analogs of N-acyl-serine phosphoric acid (NASPA) and N-acyl-ethanolamine phosphoric acid (NAEPA), which contain a serine and an ethanolamine backbone, respectively, in place of glycerol, are recognized in a stereoselective manner. This stereoselective interaction may lead to the development of receptor subtype-selective antagonists. In the present study, we review the stereochemical aspects of LPA pharmacology and describe the chemical synthesis of pure LPA enantiomers together with their ligand-binding properties toward the LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 receptors and their metabolism by lipid phosphate phosphatase 1 (LPP1). Finally, we evaluate the concept of stereopharmacology in developing novel ligands for LPA receptors.

Abstract:Recent characterization of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors has made possible studies elucidating the structure-activity relationships (SAR) for agonist activity at individual receptors. Additionally, the availability of these receptors has allowed the identification of antagonists of LPA-induced effects. Two receptor-subtype selective LPA receptor antagonists, one selective for the LPA1/EDG2 receptor (a benzyl-4-oxybenzyl N-acyl ethanolamide phosphate, NAEPA, derivative) and the other selective for the LPA3/EDG7 receptor (diacylglycerol pyrophosphate, DGPP, 8:0), have recently been reported. The receptor SAR for both agonists and antagonists are reviewed, and the molecular basis for the difference between agonism and antagonism as well as for receptor-subtype antagonist selectivity identified by molecular modeling is described. The implications of the newly available receptor-subtype selective antagonists are also discussed.

Abstract:The Gamblers' Beliefs Questionnaire (GBQ) is a self-report measure of gamblers' cognitive distortions. GBQ test items were constructed on the basis of theory, empirical evidence, and expert review. Four hundred three adults completed the initial set of items, and 21 items were selected to make up the final GBQ. The factor structure of the GBQ consisted of 2 closely related factors: Luck/Perseverance and Illusion of Control. The full scale showed good internal consistency (alpha = .92) and adequate test-retest reliability (r = .77). Problem and pathological gamblers scored higher than nonproblem gamblers on the GBQ and its factors. GBQ scores were moderately correlated with the duration of gambling sessions among problem and pathological gamblers, and there was no relationship between GBQ scores and social desirability.

Authors:['Jarmulowicz LD']

Abstract:Considering the importance of word and stem frequency in the adult lexical processing literature, and the effect of input frequency on children's acquisition of words (Tardif, Shatz, and Naigles, 1997), it was hypothesized that children's acquisition of English morphologically conditioned stress alternations would be affected by the frequency with which children were exposed to different stress-changing suffixes (e.g., -tion, -ity, and -ic). Study 1 determined the proportional representation of suffixes in a children's literature corpus, thereby allowing the suffix variable to be established. Study 2 empirically examined the effect of suffix frequency on school-aged children's judgments of primary stress placement. Findings suggest that age and suffix frequency both play a role in children's awareness of stress placement.

Abstract:Inheritance of mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA2, predisposes humans to breast and ovarian cancers. Inherited mutations in the BRCA2 gene are also known to cause susceptibility to prostate cancer. BRCA2 protein exists in a large multi-protein complex from which a novel structural DNA binding protein BRCA2-associated factor 35 (BRAF35) has been isolated. We have cloned a novel cDNA encoding an alternatively spliced protein of BRAF35, designated as BRAF25. BRAF25 transcript is present in various human cells. We have precisely mapped the BRAF25 cDNA sequence to the genomic chromosome 19 sequence. Analysis of the predicted sequence of BRAF25 identified a protein of 215 amino acids. BRAF25 contains a truncated high mobility group domain, a kinesin-like coiled-coil domain and multiple Src homology 2 (SH2) motifs. Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for BRAF25 revealed the presence of BRAF25 in human prostate cancer cells.

Abstract:BRAF25 is an alternatively spliced protein of BRAF35 (see associated paper). We have mapped the BRAF25 gene to chromosome sub-band 19p13.3, a region where loss of chromosomal heterozygosity has been reported in about 50% of ovarian cancers. Because of the high incidence of genetic links of prostate cancer to breast and ovarian cancers, we investigated the BRAF25 expression in the prostate specimens. Immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies specific for BRAF25 revealed a strong immunostaining in sections of the benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The staining was concentrated on the nuclei of cells facing the lumen of prostatic glands, even though the sporadic nuclei of cells in stromas were also stained. However, the expression of BRAF25 was dramatically reduced in intermediate prostate cancer and absent in advanced prostate cancer. Preincubation of the antibody with the immunizing peptide abolished immunostaining in BPH specimens. Therefore, the expression of BRAF25 was gradually lost in prostate cancer.

Abstract:The Hawthorne interview program between 1929 and 1932 was one of the most significant industrial studies in the United States. The Hawthorne researchers applied Jean Piaget's clinical method in their extensive interviews with tens of thousands of workers. Chiefly responsible for the program's methodology was Elton Mayo, an Australian who saw interviewing as a means to promote social cooperation. Previous discussions of the Hawthorne experiments have ignored the influence of Piaget in the social sciences. This article provides an account of Mayo's and the Hawthorne researchers' efforts to fuse Piaget's innovation with burgeoning American industrial psychology. The endeavor was not an isolated event but rather drew on the theories and practice of Janet-Piaget psychology, on the support of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial Foundation, and on the discourse among social scientists about Piaget's work.

Title:Effect of loading rate on the apparent fracture toughness of acrylic bone cement.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN 38152-3180, USA.
Abstract:In this study, a determination is made of the effect of loading rate, v (0.1 mm min(-1) versus 1.0 mm min(-1) versus 10 mm min(-1)) on the value of the plane strain fracture toughness, K(Ic), of three commercial formulations of acrylic bone cement (Osteopal), CMW3, and Copal), that are characterized as "low-", "medium-", and "high-" viscosity brands, respectively). For all formulations, K(Ic) increases with increase in v. However, while this trend is statistically significant for CMW3 and Copal, this is not so for Osteopal. The CMW3 and Copal results are explained in terms of changes of the molecular relaxation transitions in the cement and the thermal state at the crack tip of the test specimen. Two implications of the findings are discussed. In the case of Osteopal, a recommendation for further study is made.

Abstract:There is evidence from previous cross-sectional studies that high volumes of certain sports, including running, swimming and cycling, may have a negative impact on bone mineral density. The aim of the present study was to evaluate prospectively the effects of high athletic training in individuals who engage in high volumes of all three of these activities (triathletes). Bone mineral density for the total body, arms and legs was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in 21 competitive triathletes (9 men, 12 women) at the beginning of the training season and 24 weeks later. Age, body mass index, calcium intake and training volume were also recorded to examine potential mediators of bone mineral density change. Men had greater bone mineral density at all sites than women. No significant changes were observed over the 24 weeks for either total body or leg bone mineral density. Bone mineral density in both arms increased by approximately 2% in men (P < 0.03), but no change was observed for women. Change in bone mineral density at all sites was unrelated to age, body mass index, calcium intake and training volume. The results suggest that adverse changes in bone mineral density do not occur over the course of 6 months of training in competitive triathletes.

Abstract:The epithelial cells of prostate gland secrete various secretory products that play an important role in the growth and differentiation of prostate gland. These secretory products have also been implicated in neuroendocrine differentiation of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate malignancy. We have cloned a prostate-derived cDNA encoding a novel protein with a predicted molecular weight of 78 kDa (P(78)), and precisely mapped the cDNA sequence to chromosome 19. The P(78) gene has a complex genomic structure with 18 exons and 17 introns. The P(78) contains two conserved structural domains with limited similarity to domain D of synapsin I. The P(78) mRNA was expressed in various human cell lines. Western blot analysis using antibody specific for the P(78) revealed the presence of the P(78) protein in the prostate cancer cell lines with much lower level in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines compared to that in a primary prostate cancer cell line.

Authors:['Cui Y', 'Lewis G', 'Qi G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:A numerical technique, geometric element modeling and analysis, was used to investigate the effect of the cross-sectional shape of the rod (circular versus square) in three-dimensional models of the standard (dual-rod) Texas Scottish Rite Hospital (TSRH) spinal instrumentation on two biomechanical characteristics (namely, stiffness and the von Mises equivalent stress) of the instrumentation under compressive force and torque, applied separately. The model constraints are the same as those acting on the instrumentation clinically, that is, when it is attached to the vertebrae of the human spine. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the compressive and torsional loadings applied on the model are within the range of those experienced by the spine during normal walking. It was found that use of square cross-sectioned rods leads to better biomechanical performance of the model compared to the case when the rods are circular. This finding points the way to the possibility of using square cross-sectioned rods in the TSRH instrumentation.

Abstract:This paper presents the first estimates of school-level intraclass correlation (ICC) for smoking-related variables from an urban and largely African American population. Seventh graders (n = 6967) from 39 middle schools in Memphis, TN, were measured at baseline in 1994 and annually through 1997. Mixed model regression methods were used to estimate variance components for school and residual error. School-level ICCs were large enough, if ignored, to substantially inflate the Type I error rate in an analysis of treatment effects. We show how those correlations can be reduced using regression adjustments and used to determine sample size for future school-based smoking prevention studies.

Title:Spectroscopic method for the determination of the ionic site concentration in solvent polymeric membranes and membrane plasticizers.
Authors:['Gyurcsanyi RE', 'Lindner E']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, Herff College of Engineering, University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152-6582, USA.
Abstract:The built-in site density of either fixed sites or mobile hydrophobic ion sites determines whether a membrane is permselective for cations or anions of the sample. The molar ratio of the ionophore to the intrinsic or added ionic sites in an ion-selective membrane significantly influences the potentiometric response of ionophore-based electrodes. Consequently, full knowledge of the "site inventory" in an ion-selective membrane maybe essential when new, uncharacterized polymers or plasticizers are implemented for ion-selective electrode fabrication. A simple spectroscopic method was developed for the fast and accurate determination of the ionic site concentration (covalently attached functionalized groups or impurities) in plasticized polymeric membranes and membrane plasticizers. The method is based on the determination of the degree of protonation of hydrogen ion-selective chromoionophores incorporated into these membranes or dissolved in the membrane plasticizers. In electroneutral membranes, the concentration of the positively charged, protonated ionophore and the total concentration of negative sites are equal. The method was applied for the determination of ionic sites (both positively and negatively charged) in PVC materials (different purity grade, and bearing various functional groups), polyurethanes (aliphatic, aromatic, and polycarbonate-based), and selected Fluka plasticizers (2-nitrophenyl octyl ether and 2-ethylhexyl sebacate). The technique proved to be appropriate for fast quantification of ionic impurities in hydrophobic, optically transparent materials.

Title:Key issues involved with the use of miniature specimens in the characterization of the mechanical behavior of polymeric biomaterials--a review.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:This article is arranged in three parts. In the first, a brief history of the use of miniature specimens for characterizing the mechanical behavior of materials in general is given. In the second part, several trends in literature reports of small punch and small shear punch tests of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene and acrylic bone cement specimens are examined critically. In this exercise, special attention is paid to one test metric; namely, the work to failure [which is the area under the punch load (P) versus punch displacement (Delta) plot up to the failure point]. In the third part of the article, seven key issues in this field are discussed. In each case, the gaps in the current knowledge base are pointed out. Among those issues are determination of sensitivity of test results to test variables, development of methods for converting P-Delta results to bulk material properties, and constitutive modeling of the mechanical behavior of a polymeric biomaterial, under both small punch and small shear punch loading.

Title:A test phantom for estimating changes in the effective frequency of an ultrasonic scanner.
Authors:['Wilson T', 'Zagzebski J', 'Li Y']
Affiliation:Department of Radiology, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163, USA.
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Ultrasonic frequency is an important performance feature of B-mode scanners. It is particularly relevant when comparing instruments from different manufacturers and reporting clinical results. We investigated a test phantom to independently measure an effective imaging frequency, including effects of depth-dependent attenuation and frequency filtering during echo reception. METHODS: The approach capitalizes on variations of the frequency dependence of backscatter with scatterer size. A tissue-mimicking phantom containing 48-microm-diameter scatterers was constructed. Embedded at depths of 1, 3, 7, and 9 cm were sets of cylindrical inclusions, each containing tissue-mimicking material with a different scatterer size and number density. Computer simulations helped establish scatterer parameters for the cylinder bodies that resulted in image contrast versus the background that varied with frequency, with each cylinder transitioning from negative to positive contrast at a different frequency. Acoustic properties of the phantom were verified by a laboratory apparatus. Initial tests of the effectiveness of the phantom were done by imaging with several scanners using various frequency and imaging settings on transducers. RESULTS: Images were obtained with 2 clinical scanners in which modest changes in the image acquisition parameters were adjusted. Image contrast between test cylinders and background corresponded to operating frequency with a multihertz transducer. Changes in observable contrast consistent with a shift in operating frequency were not always accompanied by visual indicators that such changes in the scanning protocol had occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The test phantom performs as predicted by computer simulations and theoretical calculations of backscatter versus frequency. Contrast on images of the test phantom produced by clinical systems correlates with scanner frequency settings, showing feasibility. Relative shifts in effective frequency and operating bandwidth can be assessed from these contrast differences between settings with this test phantom.

Title:Short-term administration of basic fibroblast growth factor enhances coronary collateral development without exacerbating atherosclerosis and balloon injury-induced vasoproliferation in atherosclerotic rabbits with acute myocardial infarction.

Abstract:We evaluated the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on the extent of atherosclerosis and balloon injury-induced vasoproliferation in atherosclerotic animals with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Fifty-six rabbits were fed a 1% cholesterol diet. Balloon injury of iliac arteries and experimental acute myocardial infarction were induced in the same animals. Rabbits were then randomized to a bFGF group (20 pg/day, intravenously) or a control group (intravenous saline solution). The beneficial effects of bFGF on cardiac function, infarct size, and collateral vessel development, and the possible effect on vasoproliferation of balloon-injured vessels, were measured after 1 and 2 weeks. The extent of atherosclerosis was measured after 1, 2, and 4 weeks. Our results showed that bFGF significantly reduced infarct size and increased collateral-vessel density (P <.01) in infarct areas. Cardiac function was better in the bFGF group than in corresponding controls (P <.05). Similar beneficial effects of bFGF were noted in animals after 1- and 2-week treatments. However, the extent of atherosclerosis and the vasoproliferation in chronic atherosclerotic vessels induced by balloon injury and cholesterol diet were not significantly different between the two groups. Our results suggest that short-term treatment with bFGF enhances collateral development and produces maximum therapeutic benefits without exacerbating atherosclerosis and cell proliferation in stenotic vessels after AMI in atherosclerotic rabbits.

Abstract:A sample of 120 adolescent smokers (80 males, 40 females), most of whom were referred by school personnel after being caught with cigarettes at school (n=113), reported motivations for making a quit attempt during a smoking cessation project. Most students (n=76) were randomly assigned to a four session cessation program that included discussion of a number of motivational topics, and the remaining students were assigned to a self-help control group that received a pamphlet recommending strategies for quitting. Reported motivations for quitting did not differ significantly across the two treatment conditions. Concern about future health (73%) was the most popular reason given for making a quit attempt, followed by concern about current health (65%). Concerns about physical appearance (59%), the cost of cigarettes (52%), and athletic performance (51%) were also listed as motivators by a majority of the participants. Future health was the most popular choice for the most important motivator to quit (35%). Females and participants with fewer best friends smoking were more likely to report that the prevalence of non-smoking teenagers, the relationship between smoking and weight, and physical appearance concerns were motivators to quit. African Americans were more likely than Whites to list current health concern as the most important motivator.

Abstract:A potential method of recruiting adolescents for smoking cessation interventions is to offer treatment to students who have been caught with cigarettes at school. The present investigation surveyed 110 adolescents after they were caught with cigarettes at school. The majority of participants were daily smokers (65%) and 17% of the sample scored > or =6 on a version of the Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire. Smoking was pervasive in their social environment, with approximately half the sample reporting that all five of their five best friends smoked. Interest in quitting was evident. Most had made a quit attempt during the past year (71%) and two-thirds planned to quit within the next 6 months. However, questionable strategies (e.g., increasing caffeine consumption) had been used during previous quit attempts. The implications for developing school-based smoking cessation programs are discussed.

Title:Receptor-mediated activation of a Cl(-) current by LPA and S1P in cultured corneal keratocytes.
Authors:['Wang J', 'Carbone LD', 'Watsky MA']
Affiliation:Department of Physiology, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.
Abstract:PURPOSE: This study was designed to examine the effects of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) on Cl(-) currents (ICl(LPA)) in cultured corneal keratocytes isolated from the corneas of New Zealand White rabbits. METHODS: ICl(LPA) and resting voltages were recorded with the amphotericin perforated-patch technique. Phenotype was determined with antibodies to alpha-smooth muscle actin. RESULTS: Keratocytes cultured in serum have a phenotype (myofibroblast) and ionic currents similar to those of keratocytes isolated directly from corneas during wound healing. LPA and S1P both activated ICl(LPA) in a dose-dependent manner, and the LPA receptor-specific antagonist dioctyl-glycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP) blocked the LPA response, but not the S1P response. In addition, a relatively inactive form of LPA (LPA 8:0) was relatively ineffective in activating ICl(LPA). Activation of ICl(LPA) significantly depolarized the cells, and this depolarization was reversed by blocking ICl(LPA) with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) or 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that activation of ICl(LPA) by LPA in cultured corneal keratocytes is receptor mediated and that ICl(LPA) can also be activated by S1P. From a functional standpoint, this work confirms that the current, which is typically thought of as purely volume-activated, can be activated through a receptor. In addition, activation of ICl(LPA) results in depolarization of the keratocyte. Finally, this work demonstrates that cultured corneal keratocytes can act as a model for the study of ion channel function in keratocytes during corneal wound healing.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Identifying reliable oligonucleotide sequences for use in microarray experiments is a complex process. Two key issues are the accuracy of the input sequences and the specificity of the oligonucleotide sequences. RESULTS: We provide a suite of Perl scripts that facilitates the search for gene-specific oligonucleotides for microarray experiments. Genes of interest are first identified in the form of UniGene clusters. The sequences of these clusters were extracted and assembled into contigs to increase their accuracy. The 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the contig was parsed. Then, multiple 50mer oligonucleotide sequences with similar melting temperature were obtained from each 3'UTR. These sequences were analyzed for gene specificity. Five Cy3-labeled cDNAs were used to empirically verify the specificity of a set of 1814 50mers. CONCLUSION: Oliz can be used to select oligonucleotide sequences for microarrays. Oliz is freely available for academic users at http://www.utmem.edu/pharmacology/otherlinks/oliz.html

Title:Isothermal microcalorimetry: an analytical technique for assessing the dynamic chemical stability of UHMWPE.
Authors:['Charlebois SJ', 'Daniels AU', 'Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, The University of Tennessee-Campbell Clinic, Memphis, TN, USA. steven.charlebois@zimmer.com
Abstract:In this work, isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC) was utilized to measure the exothermic heat flow from specimens of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), that had been sterilized by various standard methods, under simulated shelf storage (air at 25 degrees C, 30% r.h.) and simulated implantation (phosphate buffered saline, PBS, at 37 degrees C) conditions. Gamma-radiation sterilized UHMWPE yielded initial heat flow rates approximately 7-10 times higher in simulated shelf storage and 2-3 times higher in simulated implantation (even after 1 month in PBS) than specimens which were unsterilized or sterilized using either ethylene oxide gas (ETO) or gas plasma (GP). These results show that gamma sterilization of UHMWPE produces many more unstable bonds in the polymer than is the case when ETO or GP is used, and that the net exothermic physico-chemical change proceeds steadily in a diffusion-limited manner in air or saline. In addition, gamma sterilization in nitrogen rather than in air did not prevent the creation of unstable bonds, but did defer physico-chemical change until the UHMWPE was exposed to oxygen. These results demonstrate the usefulness of IMC as a viable method for studying the stability of polymeric implant materials.

Abstract:Bar trajectory during weightlifting movements is related to the position of the body during the lift and the displacement of the feet during the drop-under phase. The purpose of this study was to examine anterior-posterior foot displacement and its relationship with performance in the snatch of collegiate weightlifters. Snatch attempts of men weightlifters from the 1998 U.S.A. Weightlifting Collegiate National Championships were analyzed for horizontal displacement of the feet by video analysis. Lifts were analyzed under 2 conditions: all lifts combined and the heaviest successful attempt for each lifter. Lifts (n = 74) were placed into 4 groups: forward displacement (FD, >2.5 cm); no displacement (ND, +/-2.5 cm); rearward displacement (RD, >2.5 cm); and those that showed asymmetric (AS, >7 cm difference in right and left foot) displacement of the feet. Chi-square revealed no significant difference in success rate between groups for all attempts. No statistically significant differences were noted between groups in body mass to bar mass ratio or Sinclair formula for heaviest successful attempts. Results indicate that foot displacement did not significantly affect snatch success or lifting ability in collegiate national level lifters.

Abstract:This cross-sectional study investigated the effects of participation in various sports on side-to-side (contralateral) differences in bone mineral density (BMD) of the upper and lower limbs. The BMD of the arms and legs was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The subjects were 184 collegiate athletes, both men and women, who participated in NCAA Division I-A baseball, basketball, football, golf, soccer, tennis, cross-country, indoor/outdoor track, and volleyball. Results revealed greater BMD of the right arms compared with the left arms for all teams, with the most pronounced differences observed in men's and women's tennis and men's baseball. Differences in the lower limbs were less common. No significant differences in lower limb BMD were found in the women. In men, differences in lower limb BMD were found in the football and tennis teams, with the nondominant leg having greater bone mass. Recognition of contralateral differences in bone density may be of particular interest to strength and conditioning professionals as they consider the need to include bilateral and unilateral training programs in an effort to maximize performance and minimize stress-related injuries.

Abstract:Collagen-induced activation of platelets in suspension leads to alpha(IIb)beta(3)-mediated outside-in signaling, granule release, thromboxane A2 (TxA2) production, and aggregation. Although much is known about collagen-induced platelet signaling, the roles of TxA2 production, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and dense-granule secretion, and alpha(IIb)beta(3)-mediated outside-in signaling in this process are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that TxA2 and ADP are required for collagen-induced platelet activation in response to a low, but not a high, level of collagen and that alpha(IIb)beta(3)-mediated outside-in signaling is required, at least in part, for this TxA2 production and ADP secretion. A high level of collagen can activate platelets deficient in PLC gamma 2, G alpha q, or TxA2 receptors, as well as platelets treated with a protein kinase C inhibitor, Ro31-8220. Thus, activation of alpha(IIb)beta(3) in response to a high level of collagen does not require these signaling proteins. Furthermore, a high level of collagen can cause weak TxA2 and ADP-independent aggregation, but maximal aggregation induced by a high level of collagen requires TxA2 or secretion.

Title:Effect of an accelerated aging protocol on viscoelastic properties of UHMWPE.

Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN 38152-3180, USA.
Abstract:The values of two viscoelastic properties (storage modulus and loss angle) of four sets of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene specimens were obtained. Two sets comprised specimens that had been sterilized (using gamma radiation in air or ethylene oxide gas) while the other two sets comprised specimens that were sterilized and then exposed to an accelerated aging protocol that, in the literature, has been proposed as simulating 5 years of real-time shelf aging. An analysis of the present results from the four specimen sets and those obtained, in a previous study by the present author, on specimens machined from real-time shelf aged tibial inserts suggests that the claim made for the accelerated aging protocol may be conservative.

Title:The International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA): psychometric properties of the English version.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC']

Abstract:The International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) is a seven-item questionnaire designed to be generally applicable in evaluating the effectiveness of hearing aid treatments. The inventory was developed to facilitate cooperation among researchers and program evaluators in diverse settings. It is brief and general enough to be appended to other outcome measures that might be planned in a particular application, and will provide directly comparable data across otherwise incompatible projects. For this plan to be successful, it is essential to generate psychometrically equivalent translations in the languages in which hearing aid research and treatment assessments are performed. This article reports the psychometric properties of the inventory for the original English version. The items are reasonably internally consistent, providing adequate statistical support for summing the scores to generate a total outcome score. However, for maximum internal consistency, it would be desirable to generate two scores for the inventory.

Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:The kinestatic charge detection (KCD) principle has been a digital radiography technique for more than a decade. The advances of the KCD technique have gone from diagnostic imaging to portal imaging. However, little work has been done on understanding the selection of key KCD parameters and relationships between them. In the present study, an engineering model was established that could be used to optimize the placements of key parameters in terms of KCD system mechanical design. In the proposed KCD engineering model, the basic energy conservation law was applied to the process of ion transmission. It allows for the computation of the KCD design parameters such as the optimum grid placement, high voltage board tilt angle and grid wire space, as well as to provide recommendations on high voltage board and electric potentials and their ratio.

Abstract:The goal of the present work was to test the hypothesis that test frequency, f, does not have a statistically significant effect on the in vitro fatigue life of an acrylic bone cement. Uniaxial constant-amplitude tension-compression fatigue tests were conducted on 12 sets of cements, covering three formulations with three very different viscosities, two different methods of mixing the cement constituents, and two values of f (1 and 10 Hz). The test results (number of fatigue stress cycles, N(f)) were analyzed using the linearized form of the three-parameter Weibull equation, allowing the values of the Weibull mean (N(WM)) to be determined for each set. Statistical analysis of the lnN(f) data, together with an examination of the N(WM) estimates, showed support for the hypothesis over the range of f used. The principal use and explanation of the present finding are presented.

Abstract:Smoking withdrawal effect information was collected from 75 adolescents (54 males and 21 females) making a quit attempt during a school-based smoking cessation program. A strong need to smoke was the most common withdrawal effect (60%), followed by irritability (51%), and difficulty concentrating (41%). Most (61%) participants experienced two or more withdrawal effects during the quit attempt, and withdrawal effects were evident in those smoking less than daily. Significant ethnic differences were found, with African Americans reporting significantly fewer withdrawal effects than Caucasians. After controlling for smoking frequency, African Americans were still less likely to report irritability, difficulty concentrating, and restlessness. Participants who chose to use nicotine replacement during the quit attempt were more likely to report difficulty concentrating, restlessness, and feeling miserable.

Abstract:Microarray technology has greatly aided the identification of genes that are expressed differentially. Statistical analysis of such data by multiple comparisons procedures has been slow to develop, in part, because methods to cluster the results of such comparisons in biologically meaningful ways have not been available. We isolated and analyzed, by Northern blot and GeneChip, replicate liver RNA samples (n = 4/group) from rats fed with control diet or diet containing one of three chemopreventive compounds, selected because their pharmacological activities, including RNA expression response, are relatively well understood. We report on a classification tree, based on the results of nonparametric multiple comparisons, which results in the bipolar hierarchical clustering of genes in relation to their response to treatment. In addition to identifying treatment-responsive genes, application of this procedure to our test study identified the known pharmacological relationships among the treatment groups without supervision. Also, small treatment-specific subsets of genes were identified that may be indicative of additional pharmacophores present in the test compounds.

Title:Characterization of bioactive peptides in bovine adrenal medulla by a combination of fast HPLC and ESI-MS.
Authors:['Wang H', 'Dass C']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Campus Box 526060, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:A method based upon a combination of fast high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrometry (MS) is developed for the analysis of bioactive peptides in bovine adrenal medulla. The fast HPLC uses a short column (33 mm x 4.6 mm) packed with nonporous silica-based C-18 stationary phase. Prior to HPLC separation, the medulla was homogenized and the peptide-rich fraction was isolated from it by solid-phase extraction. In-source collision-induced dissociation and tandem MS were used to obtain the sequence of the suspected peptides. Several peptides, including Met-Enk, Leu-Enk, Leu-Enk-Lys, bovine adrenal medullary (BAM)-12 (Met-Enk-RRVGRPE), Leu-Enk-Arg, and YGGT, were unambiguously identified. The first four peptides are the products of proenkephalin A precursor protein and Leu-Enk-Arg belongs to the dynorphin family and is derived from proenkephalin B (prodynorphin) precursor. The database search revealed that YGGT is a part of the sequence of five different precursor proteins.

Title:p53-mediated regulation of expression of a rabbit liver carboxylesterase confers sensitivity to 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11).

Abstract:We have exploited the ability of wild-type (wt) p53 to repress gene expression and produce tumor-selective cytotoxicity using viral-directed enzyme prodrug therapy. Vectors containing either the cytomegalovirus or Rous sarcoma virus promoter regulating transcription of a rabbit liver carboxylesterase (CE) have been constructed. Upon transfection of these plasmids into cells expressing either wt or mutant p53, differential expression of the CE has been observed, resulting in sensitization of the cells expressing the latter protein to the anticancer prodrug irinotecan, 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino] carb- onyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11). Transduction of isogenic cell lines with adenovirus containing CE under control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter confirmed the decreased sensitization of cells expressing wtp53 to CPT-11. These studies indicate that the inactivation of wtp53 by mutant p53 in human tumor cells may be sufficient enough to generate a therapeutic window for enhanced cytotoxicity with CPT-11.

Title:Isoforms of soluble alpha-tubulin in oocytes and brain of the frog (genus Rana): changes during oocyte maturation.
Authors:['Wang T', 'Lessman CA']
Affiliation:Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, The University of Memphis, 201 Life Sciences Building, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-3560, USA.
Abstract:Rana oocytes have previously been shown to contain much more soluble tubulin than does the brain, suggesting different assembly and disassembly dynamics of frog oocyte tubulin compared to that in brain. By using centrifugation, SDS-PAGE, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blots, probed with anti-alpha-tubulin monoclonal antibodies, polymorphic alpha-tubulins (isoforms) were compared in brains and follicle-enclosed oocytes of northern (Rana pipiens) and southern (R. berlandieri) frogs. Oocyte tubulin in both species had isoforms with greater ranges of isoelectric point (pI) than those of brain tubulins; in particular, the oocyte tubulin pIs ranged further into the acidic region of the isoelectric-focusing gels than corresponding brain tubulin. This difference may, in part, be responsible for the previously reported assembly differences between oocyte tubulin (undetectable assembly) and brain tubulin (high assembly). Isoforms of alpha-tubulin with relatively acidic pI were more abundant in northern frog brain and oocyte soluble extracts than in analogous extracts from southern frogs. Furthermore, additional acidic alpha-tubulin isoforms were found in progesterone-treated oocytes (i.e., eggs), indicating increased heterogeneity of acidic alpha-tubulin isoforms during oocyte meiotic maturation. Among northern frog oocyte soluble components fractionated on Superose-6b columns, tubulin complexes with apparent molecular mass of about 1800 kDa were found to contain acidic alpha-tubulin isoforms while the putative oligomeric tubulins with an apparent molecular mass of about 250 kDa contained an additional relatively basic alpha-tubulin isoform. The acidic alpha-tubulin isoforms, therefore, are proposed to be associated with cold-adaptable cells of brain and oocytes, and may also be involved in stabilization of large soluble tubulin complexes in oocytes of the northern frog.

Abstract:We surveyed influenza activity in a live poultry market in Central China for 16 months, isolating viruses from 1% of 6360 fecal samples. We obtained multiple H3N6, H9N2, H2N9, H3N3, and H4N6 isolates and single H1N1 and H3N2 isolates. Two distinct H3 molecules were identified; other hemagglutinin subtypes were phylogenetically homogeneous. The H3N6 viruses (9 genotypes) and H9N2 viruses (4 genotypes) were genetically heterogeneous, whereas the H2N9, H3N3 and H4N6 viruses had single genotypes. Thirteen representative viruses were tested for their ability to replicate in quail and chickens. All tested viruses replicated in the respiratory tract of quail. Only nine of the viruses were shed in detectable levels in infected chickens, and four of these were detected in less than 50% of infected birds. A single H4N6 isolate caused disease and systemic spread in chickens. These findings show that quail are broadly susceptible to different subtypes of influenza A virus.

Title:The relative influence of five variables on the in vitro wear rate of uncrosslinked UHMWPE acetabular cup liners.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Fencl RM', 'Carroll M', 'Collins T']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-3180, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:The wear factors, k(exp)(in 10(-6)mm(3)N(-1)m(-1)), of two sets of hemispherical uncrosslinked ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene UHMWPE acetabular cup liners, when articulated against 28-mm-diameter Co-Cr alloy femoral heads, were determined in a hip joint wear simulator. All test conditions used were the same for both sets, with the exception that in one set (comprising six liners), the bovine serum concentration in the test lubricant (P) was 25vol%, while it was 90vol% for the other set (comprising seven liners). For each liner in each set, the values of the following independent or explanatory variables were determined: the tensile toughness (U, in MJm(-3)) of the UHMWPE; the degree of crystallinity (%C) of the UHMWPE; the mean surface roughness (R(a), in microm) of the liner; and the radial clearance between the femoral head and the liner (DeltaL, in mm). All the results in both sets were combined and correlational analyses were performed between k(exp), on the one hand, and various combinations of U, %C,R(a),DeltaL, and P, on the other hand. It was found that the strongest correlations were obtained when P was included, but that %C and U are also important variables. Within the range of values of the independent variables used, the recommended relationship isk(exp)=460U(0.72)%C(-5.29)P(-0.66)(adjustedr(2)=0.858). This relationship has many potential uses, such as for screening uncrosslinked UHMWPEs that are being considered as candidates for fabricating acetabular cup liners, and for conducting studies of the sensitivity of k(exp) to a change in a value of a specified independent variable (with the values of all the other independent variables held constant). These uses, as well as the study limitations, are discussed in detail.

Title:A prospective evaluation of the relationships between smoking dosage and body mass index in an adolescent, biracial cohort.

Abstract:Although there is clearly an inverse relationship between smoking and body weight, recent studies suggest that weight attenuation via smoking is slow and may take decades to accrue. This investigation prospectively evaluated the relationships between smoking dosage (or lack thereof) and relative weight change in 1697 adolescents followed over 4 years. A 4 (smoking groups: 0, 1, 2, or 3 or more years of smoking exposure)x2 (ethnicity: Caucasian or African American)x2 (gender: male or female) analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to assess weight gain attenuation associated with increasing exposure to smoking. The overall results revealed a significant three-way interaction between smoking dosage, gender, and ethnicity. Specifically, smoking initiation was associated with an increase in body mass index (BMI) for 2 years after initiation. For those youth smoking 3 or more years, body weights were almost identical compared to never-smokers. No significant reductions in body weight were observed in any gender or ethnic group for up to 3 years after smoking initiation. It is concluded that smoking initiation is not associated with adolescent body weight change for at least a 3-year period.

Abstract:Food supplementation studies of breeding birds have traditionally concentrated on energetic constraints on breeding performance. It is only recently that the nutritional quality of the prebreeding diet has also been considered influential. We examined the importance of specific nutrients in the prebreeding diet of the Florida scrub-jay ( Aphelocoma coerulescens). Birds were provided with one of two supplements (rich in protein and fat or rich in fat only) prior to breeding in 2000 and 2001 and their breeding performance, in relation to unsupplemented (control) birds, was examined. Birds receiving both supplements significantly advanced laying in both years, and increased clutch size in 2000 but not in 2001. Laying date explained variation in clutch size in birds on dietary supplements. Egg mass and volume declined with laying order, irrespective of dietary treatment, but birds on the high fat, high protein diet laid heavier third eggs than controls and this was independent of laying date. Laboratory analysis of 14 abandoned and unhatched eggs revealed that as egg mass increased so did the absolute amount of protein and water while fat content remained relatively fixed. Using these relationships between the masses of egg components and fresh egg mass, we calculated that heavier third eggs laid by birds on high fat and high protein, compared with those laid by controls, contained more water that may be fundamental to chick growth and survival. This is the first demonstration for an avian species that nutritional quality of prebreeding diet can simultaneously influence laying date, clutch size, and egg size and composition.

Title:Rapid progression to regular cigarette smoking among nonsmoking adolescents: interactions with gender and ethnicity.

Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. jblitstn@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: While the correlates and predictors associated with transition through the stages of smoking acquisition have received substantial attention, the identification of factors associated with the time course of progression remain generally unexplored. METHODS: We identified adolescents escalating from nonsmoking to regular smoking in 1 year as rapid progressors (n = 98) and those escalating from nonsmoking to experimental smoking in 1 year as slow progressors (n = 555). We entered demographic and psychosocial variables, initial reactions to smoking variables, and their interactions with gender and ethnicity into a logistic regression analysis comparing rapid progressors to slow progressors. RESULTS: At baseline, rapid progressors reported more friends who smoked regularly. Girls who reported more concern with dieting and less social success were more likely to progress to regular smoking within 1 year; these variables did not influence progression in boys. Those who associated positive feelings with their initial smoking experience were more likely to progress to regular smoking. Differences between white and African American youth emphasize the importance of physiological interpretations of initial smoking experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that even as nonsmokers, adolescents likely to progress quickly to regular smoking can be identified. Researchers designing prevention programs should take these factors into account.

Title:Finite element analysis of a model of a therapeutic shoe: effect of material selection for the outsole.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN 38152-3180, USA.
Abstract:The finite element analysis method was used to perform a sensitivity study of the effect of the materials used for the two layers of the outsole (high-density polyethylene, HDPE, and polyurethane, PU) of a "solid rocker-bottom" design of a therapeutic shoe on the responses (stresses and displacements) of a model of the shoe. It was found that the aforementioned materials choice affected the model responses in a noticeable manner. For example, when HDPE was used for the top layer of the outsole, the von Mises stress at the interface between the bottom of the foot and the top layer of the insole ranged from being about 8% lower to being about 62% higher compared to when PU was used. The implications of this finding are discussed.

Abstract:This meta-analysis examined 118 studies of the psychosocial outcomes of children exposed to interparental violence. Correlational studies showed a significant association between exposure and child problems (d = -0.29). Group comparison studies showed that witnesses had significantly worse outcomes relative to nonwitnesses (d = -0.40) and children from verbally aggressive homes (d = -0.28). but witnesses' outcomes were not significantly different from those of physically abused children (d = 0.15) or physically abused witnesses (d = 0.13). Several methodological variables moderated these results. Similar effects were found across a range of outcomes, with slight evidence for greater risk among preschoolers. Recommendations for future research are made, taking into account practical and theoretical issues in this area.

Abstract:Raman, and infrared spectra of mesna and dimesna have been collected in the present spectroscopic studies. Based on the group frequencies, relative intensities and Raman depolarization measurements, some vibrational assignments have been suggested. For both mesna and dimesna, at least two rotational conformers have been identified. Adsorption behavior was investigated from the recorded surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra. It was found that both mesna and dimesna adsorbed as thiolate on silver sol particles with the cleavage of the S-H bond in mesna and the S-S bond in dimesna. For the adsorbed thiolate, two conformers existed in the adsorption state.

Abstract:To examine the skeletal muscle characteristics of power lifters, 5 competitive power lifters (PL; X +/- SE; age = 31.0 +/- 1.5 years, squat = 287.7 +/- 15.7 kg, bench press = 170.5 +/- 17.7 kg, and deadlift = 284.2 +/- 7.5 kg) and 5 untrained control subjects (CON; age = 27.3 +/- 3.3 years) served as subjects. Isokinetic squat force and power was greater (p < 0.05) for the PL at all bar velocities (0.20, 0.82, and 1.43 m;pd s(-1)), as was vertical jump height and estimated power. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis m. revealed significant differences for percent fiber type (PL, IIA = 45.5 +/- 1.6%, IIB = 1.3 +/- 0.8%; CON, IIA = 33.4 +/- 3.1%, IIB = 12.0 +/- 2.4%); percent fiber type area (PL, IIA = 51.8 +/- 1.6%, IIB = 1.3 +/- 0.8%; CON, IIA = 43.5 +/- 3.4%, IIB = 12.4 +/- 2.6%); and percent myosin heavy chain isoform (PL, IIa = 59.5 +/- 6.1%; CON, 46.5 +/- 2.5%). Muscle fiber characteristics were significantly correlated (r = +/- 0.61) with numerous strength and power measures for the PL. These data illustrate the muscle fiber characteristics necessary for the maximal force production requirements of power lifting.

Affiliation:Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.
Abstract:The orphan glutamate receptor delta2 is selectively expressed in Purkinje cells and plays a crucial role in cerebellar functions. Recently, ataxia in the hotfoot mouse ho4J was demonstrated to be caused by a deletion in the delta2 receptor gene (Grid2) removing the N-terminal 170 amino acids of the delta2 receptor. To understand how delta2 receptors function, we characterized mutations in eight additional spontaneously occurring hotfoot alleles of Grid2. The mouse Grid2 gene consists of 16 exons, spanning approximately 1.4 Mb. Genomic DNA analysis showed that seven hotfoot mutants had a deletion of one or more exons encoding the N-terminal domain of delta2 receptors. The exception is ho5J, which has a point mutation in exon 12. Deletions in ho7J, ho9J, ho11J and ho12J mice result in the in-frame deletion of between 40 and 95 amino acids. Expression of constructs containing these deletions in HEK293 cells resulted in protein retention in the endoplasmic reticulum or cis-Golgi without transport to the cell surface. Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicated that these deletions also reduce the intermolecular interaction between individual delta2 receptors. These results indicate that the deleted N-terminal regions are crucial for oligomerization of delta2 receptors and their subsequent transport to the cell surface of Purkinje cells. The relatively large size of the Grid2 gene may be one of the reasons why many spontaneous mutations occur in this gene. In addition, the frequent occurrence of in-frame deletions within the N-terminal domain in hotfoot mutants suggests the importance of this domain in the function of delta2 receptors.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To investigate how much information a vibrational technique can reveal regarding the loosening of the femoral component of a total hip arthroplasty. DESIGN: Numerical modal analysis using finite element method and computer simulation. BACKGROUND: Existing work suggested that this technique is capable of revealing total hip arthroplasty loosening. However, the potentials of this technique are not fully studied yet. There is a need to establish the limitation of this technique. METHODS: Numerical modal analysis was conducted to obtain the natural frequencies and mode shapes of femoral models under free vibration. An absent interface portion was hypothesized at specified locations the data from modal analysis were then used in a computer simulation to visualize the vibration diagnosis. RESULTS: The effects of interface failure on the femoral component stiffness vary with the locations and sizes of failure. Nominal critical, reliable, and nondetectable levels of interface failure are found. CONCLUSION: When the size of failure is more than one-third of the stem length, this tool is able to provide a reliable diagnosis. The critical detectable interface failure size is one-fifth of the stem length. It was found that the motion at higher harmonics is the most sensitive to the interface failure. This tool is unlikely to differentiate the slight differences in natural frequencies that occur when the interface failure length is less than one-sixth of the stem length. It is likely to fail in detecting failures located at the stem central portion regardless of their length. RELEVANCE: A numerical study of the vibration tool is important prior to pursuing clinical trials of the tool and may guide the characterizations involved in the trials.

Title:Influence of lamella features of UHMWPE on its physical and uniaxial tensile properties. I. Effect of sterilization method in uncrosslinked and unaged materials.

Abstract:The changes in the tensile toughness (U), degree of crystallinity (%C), melting temperature (Tm), lamella thickness, and lamella alignment of uncrosslinked and unaged GUR 1150HP ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene specimens, following different sterilization treatments (none, gamma-irradiation in air, gamma-irradiation in a nitrogen-rich atmosphere, ethylene oxide gas, and gas plasma) were determined. For each of the properties - U, %C, and Tm - the only significant difference in the mean value was found between the set of specimens gamma-irradiated in air, on the one hand, and each of the other sets, on the other hand. It was found that lamella thickness showed little change between the groups of specimens but there was a significant difference in the lamella orientation between the set of specimens that had been gamma-irradiated in air, on the one hand, and each of the other sets, on the other. It thus appears that the changes seen in the physical and mechanical properties determined may be a reflection of the change in the polymer's lamella alignment.

Title:Fatigue testing and performance of acrylic bone-cement materials: state-of-the-art review.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:Over the past three decades or so, a very large volume of literature has been generated on the impact of an assortment of variables on the fatigue lifetimes of a large number of acrylic bone-cement formulations. In the present article, this literature is examined critically to reveal areas of agreement, areas of disagreement, as well as a welter of underexplored and unexplored topics. For example, there is unanimity of support for the notion that an increase in the molecular weight of the powder constituents or the fully cured cement leads to an increase in the cement's fatigue life, whereas there is disagreement as to whether vacuum mixing the cement constituents leads to an increase in the fatigue life of the fully cured cement (relative to the hand-mixed counterpart). Among the underexplored topics is systematic study of the effect of test frequency on the fatigue results, whereas determination of the optimal concentration of the antibiotic in an antibiotic-loaded cement is an example of the unexplored topics. It is pointed out that resolving the controversies, addressing the underexplored topics, and filling the lacunae will allow comprehensive evaluations of acrylic bone-cement materials to be made. This enhanced body of knowledge will prove invaluable in the continued use of acrylic bone cement as the anchoring agent in cemented arthroplasties.

Title:Schedule-induced ethanol self-administration in DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice.
Authors:['Mittleman G', 'Van Brunt CL', 'Matthews DB']
Affiliation:Psychology Department, University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. G.Mittleman@mail.psyc.memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: The purpose of these experiments was to provide an initial investigation into ethanol self-administration elicited in the schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) paradigm. METHODS: Mature male mice were food deprived to between 80 and 85% of their baseline weight and received 20 daily 1 hr SIP test sessions in which a food pellet (20 mg) was delivered on a fixed-time 60 sec schedule. In different groups, the acquisition of drinking 5% (v/v) ethanol solution (experiment 1) or water (experiment 2) was recorded along with other behaviors that occurred in the test chambers. RESULTS: Results indicated that C57BL/6J mice drank significantly more ethanol than DBA/2J mice and that C57 mice achieved blood alcohol concentrations as high as 300 mg/dl. Blood alcohol concentrations were consistently correlated with g/kg ethanol intake. The groups did not differ in consumption of water. SIP test sessions using higher concentrations of ethanol (10-20% v/v, experiment 1) or sucrose solutions (0.1-2% w/v, experiment 2) then were performed. Group differences in ethanol consumption were maintained at all ethanol concentrations. Although DBAs drank more of a low concentration of sucrose (0.1%), when expressed as g/kg, sucrose intake was equivalent in the two strains at all concentrations. Analysis of the time course of drinking clearly showed that this behavior was adjunctive in nature. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the effectiveness of this procedure in inducing ethanol self-administration and its utility for investigating the genetic bases of vulnerability toward excessive ethanol consumption.

Title:Instrumental and perceptual evaluations of two related singers.
Authors:['Buder EH', 'Wolf T']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. ehbuder@memphis.edu
Abstract:The primary goal of this study was to characterize a performer's singing and speaking voice. One woman was not admitted to a premier choral group, but her sister, who was comparable in physical characteristics and background, was admitted and provided a valuable control subject. The perceptual judgment of a vocal coach who conducted the group's auditions was decisive in discriminating these 2 singers. The singer not admitted to the group described a history of voice pathology, lacked a functional head register, and spoke with a voice characterized by hoarseness. Multiple listener judgments and acoustic and aerodynamic evaluations of both singers provided a more systematic basis for determining: 1) the phonatory basis for this judgment; 2) whether similar judgments would be made by groups of vocal coaches and speech-language pathologists; and 3) whether the type of tasks (e.g., sung vs. spoken) would influence these judgments. Statistically significant differences were observed between the ratings of vocal health provided by two different groups of listeners. Significant interactions were also observed as a function of the types of voice samples heard by these listeners. Instrumental analyses provided evidence that, in comparison to her sister, the rejected singer had a compromised vocal range, glottal insufficiencies as assessed aerodynamically and electroglottographically, and impaired acoustic quality, especially in her speaking voice.

Title:Effect of test specimen cross-sectional shape on the in vitro fatigue life of acrylic bone cement.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Janna S']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-3180, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:Constant-amplitude uniaxial tension-compression fatigue tests were conducted on specimens fabricated from 12 sets of acrylic bone cements, covering cement formulations with three different viscosities (so-called "high-", "medium-" and "low-viscosity" varieties), two different methods of mixing the cement constituents (so-called "hand-" and "vacuum-mixed" methods) and two test specimen shapes (rectangular-cross-sectioned or "flat" and circular-cross-sectioned or "round"). The test results-namely, the number of fatigue stress cycles, N(f)-were analyzed using the linearized transformation of the three-parameter Weibull relationship, allowing the values of the Weibull mean, N(WM), to be determined for each set. Values ranged from 14,300 to 1,284,331 for the round specimen sets and from 2898 to 72,960 for the flat specimen sets. Statistical analysis of the ln N(f) data, together with an examination of the N(WM) values, showed that, for any combination of cement formulation and mixing method, round specimens had significantly longer fatigue lives compared to flat ones. These results are explained in terms of two factors. The first is the smaller surface area of the waisted zone in the round specimens compared to that in the flat specimens (nominal value of 157mm(2) versus nominal value of 185mm(2)), leading to the possibility of fewer crack initiation sites on the round specimens compared to the flat ones. Secondly, it is postulated that the crystallinity of the round specimens was higher than that of the flat ones, a consequence of the significantly lower measured residual liquid monomer contents of the former compared to the latter (3.40+/-1.28wt%/wt compared to 3.81+/-1.48wt%/wt). The significance of the present finding is that it indicates that, for a set of bone cement formulation and experimental conditions, discriminating fatigue test results are more likely to be obtained if flat, rather than round, test specimens are used.

Title:Use of isothermal heat-conduction microcalorimetry (IHCMC) for the evaluation of synthetic biomaterials.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Daniels AU']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-3180, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:Isothermal heat-conduction microcalorimetry (IHCMC) allows measurement of extremely small rates of heat flow-on the order of 0.1 microwatt. This provides, for example, the ability to directly observe-and quantitate in a few days-rates of degradation as low as 1% per year at body temperature, in solid material samples of a few grams. Also, one method of IHCMC data analysis allows direct determination of the reaction-rate constant at the temperature of interest, thereby avoiding possible errors due to rate mechanism changes with temperature, an issue that needs to be considered when the Arrhenius method is used. IHCMC can also be used to measure transient phenomena, such as heat of adsorption, and initial metabolic responses of cellular entities to biomaterials. The purposes of this review article are to (a) explain the basic principles, attractive features, limitations, and methods of IHCMC; (b) describe biomaterials applications to date--including studies of the stability of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene and implant-grade calcium sulfate, setting reactions of dental adhesives, and macrophage response to biomaterial particles; (c) provide a discussion of issues and concerns that should be addressed in order to maximize the utility of IHCMC in biomaterials studies; and (d) suggest a number of possible future biomaterials applications for this technique.

Abstract:The recently introduced camptothecin-derived chemotherapeutic agents have demonstrated remarkable promise in cancer therapy and as such have been approved for use in humans for the treatment of ovarian, lung, and colon cancer. CPT-11 is a prodrug that is activated by esterases to yield the potent topoisomerase I inhibitor, SN-38. Considerable success has been achieved in the treatment of both naive and drug-resistant colon cancer with CPT-11. However, mechanisms of resistance to this agent have not been explored in detail. The role of the ATP-dependent drug transporter ABCG2 in CPT-11 cytotoxicity is unclear because some ABCG2 mutants confer camptothecin resistance, whereas others do not. Because CPT-11 is activated by carboxylesterases (CEs), we assessed the relative contribution of each protein in mediating CPT-11 toxicity by both drug accumulation and cell growth-inhibition assays. Our results indicate that the expression of ABCG2 protects cells from CPT-11 toxicity, even in the presence of high levels of a rabbit liver carboxylesterase (rCE), which can efficiently activate the drug. However, this can be partially overcome by the ABCG2 inhibitor reserpine. These studies indicate that overexpression of ABCG2 in vivo would probably overcome any increased drug activation that might be achieved by gene delivery or antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy methods using rCE.

Title:AlphaIIbbeta3-mediated outside-in signaling induced by the agonist peptide LSARLAF utilizes ADP and thromboxane A2 receptors to cause alpha-granule secretion by platelets.

Abstract:The peptide LSARLAF (LSA) causes alphaIIbbeta3-dependent platelet activation that results in alpha-granule secretion and aggregation. LSARLAF-induced, alphaIIbbeta3-mediated outside-in signaling causing alpha-granule secretion and platelet aggregation was studied using washed mouse platelets. ADP receptor antagonists, enzyme inhibitors, normal platelets and platelets from mice that lack either Galphaq or thromboxane (Tx) A2 receptors were used for this investigation. The results demonstrate that LSA-induced alphaIIbbeta3-mediated signaling producing aggregation of washed platelets is mediated through the release of ADP and thromboxane, which cause alpha-granule release by mediating their effects though Galphaq and/or Gi depending on the level of LSA used to activate the platelets. Specifically, alphaIIbbeta3 elicited aggregation of washed platelets in response to a low level of LSA requires signaling through the ADP receptor P2Y1 and Galphaq, and the ADP receptor P2Y12 and Gi as well as TxA2 receptors. However, this aggregation is independent of Galphaq and TxA2 signaling in response to high LSA concentrations, but is dependent on ADP signaling through its receptor P2Y12, and therefore presumably Gi, regardless of the level of LSA used to activate the platelets. PKC function is required for ADP secretion and the subsequent signaling through P2Y12 regardless of the level of LSA used to activate the platelets. The end point of the LSA-induced alphaIIbbeta3-mediated signaling characterized in this study is alpha-granule secretion, which provides the fibrinogen required for aggregation of washed platelets.

Abstract:The Reelin signaling pathway controls neuronal positioning during mammalian brain development by binding to the very low density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein E receptor-2, and signaling through the intracellular adapter protein Disabled-1 (Dab1). To identify new components in the Reelin signaling pathway, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen to select Dab1-interacting proteins. Here, we report the characterization of a new mouse Dab1-interacting protein that is orthologous to rat Dab2IP, a Ras-GTPase activating protein previously shown to bind to Dab2/DOC. The interaction of Dab1 and Dab2IP was confirmed in biochemical assays and by co-immunoprecipitation from brain lysates. The site of interaction between Dab1 and Dab2IP was narrowed to the Dab1-PTB domain and the NPxY motif in Dab2IP. The deduced amino acid sequence of mouse Dab2IP encompasses 1,208 residues containing several protein interaction motifs as well as a Ras-like GAP-related domain. Northern blot analysis revealed at least two isoforms of Dab2IP mRNA in the brain, both of which exhibited increased expression during development. In situ hybridization analyses indicated that Dab2IP mRNA is diffusely expressed throughout the developing and the adult brain. Using a polyclonal antiserum specific for Dab2IP, we observed protein expression in the soma and processes of neurons in a variety of brain structures, including the developing cerebral cortex. Our findings suggest that Dab2IP may function as a downstream effector in the Reelin signaling pathway that influences Ras signaling during brain development.

Abstract:Laser-induced optoacoustic spectroscopy (LIOAS) was used to determine the enthalpies and volumes of reactions for each step in ligand substitution of molybdenum hexacarbonyl with tetrahydrothiophene (THT). The enthalpy for substitution of CO on Mo(CO)6 by an alkane and of coordinated alkane on Mo(CO)5(alkane) by THT are 114 and -99 kJ mol(-1), respectively. Likewise, the volumes of reaction are 13 and -16 ml mol(-1). These results allow the calculation of the bond energies for Mo-alkane (56 kJ mol(-1)) and Mo-THT (155 kJ mol(-1)). Furthers studies should reveal that, for certain cases, the volume of reaction can be neglected in the determination of enthalpies of ligand substitution by LIOAS.

Abstract:This paper provides an overview of the measurement of hearing aid fitting outcomes in real life using self-report methods. Three topics are addressed: (1) why we should measure real-life outcomes; (2) seven different types of self-report outcome data; and (3) issues to consider in self-report outcome measurement. It is stressed that self-report data provide a unique view of the way that clients function and feel in their daily lives with regard to their hearing health. Self-report outcome data are multidimensional, and the different domains are only moderately correlated. When these types of data are gathered, it is essential to control relevant variables to safeguard validity and reliability.

Abstract:The purpose of these studies was to examine the axial evolution of the negative glow in a hollow cathode discharge. The time-average negative glow profiles along the central axis of a hollow cathode were recorded for 81 pulse widths over the range of 5-25 microseconds in increments of 0.25 microseconds at a constant interpulse delay of 206.4 microseconds. Subsequent numerical processing yielded the instantaneous negative glow profile. The negative glow was viewed through a mesh-covered slot along the length of the hollow cathode. The negative flow profiles were imaged using a vidicon video camera. A PC-based frame grabber digitized the video images and stored them for subsequent processing.

Abstract:This work aims at studying dynamical models of neural networks, which exhibit phase transitions between states of various complexities. We use the biologically motivated KIII model, which has demonstrated excellent performance as a robust dynamical memory device. KIII is a high-dimensional dynamical system with extremely fragmented boundaries between limit cycles, tori, fixed points, and chaotic attractors. We study the role of additive noise in the development of itinerant trajectories. Noise not only stabilizes aperiodic trajectories, but there is an optimum noise level with highly itinerant behavior. We speculate that the previously found optimum classification performance of KIII as a function of the noise level, also identified as chaotic resonance, is related to chaotic itinerant oscillations among various ordered states.

Abstract:A sample of 372 adolescents completed annual surveys regarding their initial reactions to smoking (IRTS) and their current smoking status. Each annual survey asked participants if they had the following five reactions the first time they smoked a cigarette: coughing, or feeling dizzy, sick, high, or relaxed. Time 1 IRTS data were collected within 1 year of the reported initial smoking experience, and Time 2 IRTS data were collected 1 year later. Kappa values for two IRTS items, coughing (.45) and dizziness (.40), indicated modest but acceptable reliability across a 1-year period, but the remaining items showed poor reliability (all < or =.31). Logistic regression analyses indicated that no IRTS item significantly predicted regular (at least weekly) smoking 1 year later. However, when IRTS and smoking status were assessed concurrently (at Time 2), reports of feeling relaxed and not coughing during the initial episode were significantly correlated with regular smoking. Participants who progressed from experimental to regular smoking from Time 1 to Time 2 were more likely to report relaxation as an initial reaction to smoking at Time 2 after denying relaxation at Time 1.

Abstract:In a recent work, we demonstrated the usefulness of the Hilbert transform in identifying the in-plane rotation angle between two objects. Here we use the Hilbert-wavelet bases instead of the Hilbert transform in the determination of the exact angle of rotation. We describe the design of the two-dimensional Hilbert-wavelet filter based on the spectral-factorization method to generate a Hilbert-transform pair of orthogonal wavelet bases. We compare the relative performance of the Hilbert transform and the Hilbert wavelet to identify both in-plane and out-of-plane rotation angles. We demonstrate that the Hilbert wavelet offers better rotation-angle determination than the Hilbert transform. We present correlation based rotated and scaled object identification and tracking using Hilbert or Hilbert-wavelet transformed infrared image sequences. We also demonstrate reduced data handling and improved tracking of distorted objects using the Hilbert-wavelet transform.

Abstract:The platelet fibrinogen (Fg) receptor (GPIIb/IIIa) is an integrin which plays a critical role in hemostasis by recognizing at least the four adhesive ligands: Fg, fibronectin (Fn), vitronectin (Vn), and von Willebrand factor (vWf). We reported that residues 309-312 of GPIIb alpha appear to comprise at least part of a Fg binding site on the Fg receptor (Gartner, T. K., and Taylor, D. B. (1990) Thromb. Res. 60, 291-309). Here we report that the peptide GPIIb alpha 300-312 (G13) inhibits platelet aggregation and binds Fg and Vn. Significantly, this peptide inhibits the adhesion of stimulated platelets to Fg, Fn, Vn, and vWf, but not the adhesion of resting platelets to Fn. Thus, GPIIb 300-312 may constitute a specific but common recognition site on GPIIb/IIIa for both LGGAKQAGDV- and RGD-containing ligands.

Title:Molecular genetics of sex determination in channel catfish: studies on SRY, ZFY, Bkm, and human telomeric repeats.

Abstract:In amniotes, the banded krait minor (Bkm) minisatellite (GATA), the human telometric sequence (TTAGGG)7, and the Y-specific genes, ZFY and SRY, are associated with a particular sex. These sequences were studied in the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus. However, none was sex-specific in catfish; homologs of each were present in males and females. Our data suggest that components of mammalian sex-determining systems may be widespread and shared among the vertebrates in general. Whether those components are involved in sex determination in lower vertebrates or merely represent evolutionary precursors of sex-determining factors in amniotes remains to be determined.

Title:Maturation of hearing aid benefit: objective and subjective measurements.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:The goals of this investigation were to determine whether hearing aid benefit improved significantly over the first 10 weeks of hearing aid use and whether time-related changes in benefit (if any) were affected by the type of benefit measurement (i.e., objective or subjective). A total of 17 hearing-impaired subjects participated, with different subjects completing different phases of the study. Benefit was measured soon after the hearing aid fitting and again after 10 weeks of adjustment to hearing aid use. Objective benefit data were determined using the Connected Speech Test. No significant changes in objective benefit were noted in noisy or reverberant listening environments when visual cues were available. However, in a low-noise setting and in a noisy setting without visual cues, improvements in objective benefit were seen over time. Subjective benefit data were derived from responses to the Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit. These data indicated significant benefit improvement over time in all five types of daily life situations assessed, although the improvement was small in reverberant and noisy environments. Significant, but modest, correlations were found between objective and subjective data for low-noise and reverberant listening environments. Comparison of experienced and novice hearing aid wearers suggested that although experienced wearers obtain more benefit than novice wearers, they evidence similar time-related changes in benefit during the first 10 weeks of new hearing aid use.

Title:Effect of aging the hollow cathode by sputtering on the analytical precision of the hollow cathode discharge emission source.
Authors:['Tseng JL', 'Kung JY', 'Williams JC', 'Griffin ST']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:Sputtering changes the analytical performance of the hollow cathode as an emission source. Proper conditioning (aging) of the hollow with sputtering greatly improves precision. Conditioning decreases the blank emission signal and changes the shape of the hollow. Micrographs which show the evolution of the bottom of the hollow into a stable bulb shape are presented. The blank emission signal decreases with aging of the hollow and approaches a constant value when the hollow is properly conditioned. A short-term stability (n = 5) of approximately 1.8% RSD has been observed frequently. An average long-term stability over several days (n = 45) of 4.5% for Li and 3.5% for Na in the emission signal from microsamples (less than 50 nL) deposited in the hollow cathode discharge source is reported here. Instrumentation, operation, and sample preparation procedures are described.

Title:Predictability and reliability of hearing aid benefit measured using the PHAB.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Rivera IM']
Affiliation:Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis, TN.
Abstract:This investigation explored the extent to which self-assessed hearing aid benefit measured by the Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (PHAB) could be predicted from adaptation to hearing loss and/or from communication difficulties reported without amplification. Adaptation to hearing loss was measured using 13 scales of the Communication Profile for the Hearing Impaired (CPHI). These were combined to produce three composite CPHI scores. Results from 58 experienced hearing aid wearers indicated that benefit was significantly related to magnitude of unaided difficulties for all seven PHAB subscales. In addition, one of the three composite CPHI scores contributed to benefit prediction for the two sound perception subscales of the PHAB. Test-retest reliability of PHAB subscale scores was evaluated for 28 subjects using correlations and difference distributions. Reliability was found to be consistent with previous studies but modest. Critical differences were large compared with the anticipated size of benefit differences due to, for example, different hearing aid prescriptions. It is concluded that the PHAB is best suited for group research: when used for individual subjects, the PHAB may not be sensitive enough to detect important differences between hearing aid conditions.

Title:Magnetic properties of iron nitride-silica nanocomposite materials prepared by high-energy ball milling.
Authors:['Mishra SR', 'Viano A', 'Roy S', 'Ali N', 'Losby J']
Affiliation:Department of Physics, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:Powder mixtures of (FexN)y and (SiO2)1-y, with x between 3 and 4 and y equal to 0.2 or 0.6, were ball-milled for 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 h. X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and magnetization measurements allowed an investigation of structural and magnetic properties to be carried out. The samples consist of nanostructured Fe3N and Fe4N particles in a SiO2 matrix. As the milling time increases, the Fe4N phase is eliminated from the particles in favor of Fe3N. Coercive fields as high as 270 and 84 Oe are obtained for (FexN)0.2(SiO2)0.8 at 5 and 300 K, respectively. This higher coercive field, upon cooling, indicates the presence of small superparamagnetic particles. The coercive field also increases with milling time, which is due to the reduced particle size and induced stain. The saturation magnetization decreases with increased milling time as a consequence of an increase in the superparamagnetic fraction and increased strain. Hard and soft magnetic properties are observed for y = 0.2 and y = 0.6 samples, respectively.

Abstract:CONTEXT: Adult survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for medical and psychosocial sequelae that may adversely affect their health status. OBJECTIVES: To compare the health status of adult survivors of childhood cancer and siblings and to identify factors associated with adverse outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Health status was assessed in 9535 adult participants of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of long-term survivors of childhood cancer who were diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. A randomly selected cohort of the survivors' siblings (n = 2916) served as a comparison group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Six health status domains were assessed: general health, mental health, functional status, activity limitations, cancer-related pain, and cancer-related anxiety/fears. The first 4 domains were assessed in the control group. RESULTS: Survivors were significantly more likely to report adverse general health (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-3.0; P<.001), mental health (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.6-2.1; P<.001), activity limitations (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.3-3.3; P<.001), and functional impairment (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 4.1-6.6; P<.001), compared with siblings. Forty-four percent of survivors reported at least 1 adversely affected health status domain. Sociodemographic factors associated with reporting at least 1 adverse health status domain included being female (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.6; P<.001), lower level of educational attainment (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.8-2.2; P<.001), and annual income less than 20 000 dollars (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.6-2.1; P<.001). Relative to those survivors with childhood leukemia, an increased risk was observed for at least 1 adverse health status domain among those with bone tumors (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.8-2.5; P<.001), central nervous system tumors (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-2.0; P<.001), and sarcomas (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5; P =.01). CONCLUSION: Clinicians caring for adult survivors of childhood cancer should be aware of the substantial risk for adverse health status, especially among females, those with low educational attainment, and those with low household incomes.

Abstract:A substantial number of cigarette smokers are thought to engage in regular exercise. It is unclear why individuals who engage in a health-promoting activity such as exercising would simultaneously engage in a health-damaging behavior like smoking. Two possibilities are that (1) exercise serves as a "harm reduction" strategy to lessen the negative effects of smoking, or (2) that among weight conscious individuals, exercise and smoking are both used as weight control strategies. To examine these issues, smoking status, physical activity level, weight concerns, and several additional health behaviors and attitudes were assessed by questionnaire in a population of United States Air Force recruits (n=32,144). Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to compare characteristics of highly physically active smokers with both highly physically active never-smokers, and less active smokers. A substantial proportion of smokers reported being highly physically active (15.8%), although this proportion was significantly higher for never-smokers (22.7%). Active smokers were similar to active never-smokers across several health behaviors and attitudes, including diet, seatbelt use, and attitudes toward illegal drugs and condom use. Compared to less active smokers, active smokers consumed more fruits and vegetables, worried less about their weight, were less nicotine dependent, and had greater previous success at quitting smoking. These findings indicate that a substantial proportion of highly physically active young adults are regular cigarette smokers. Based on findings regarding general health behaviors and smoking history, this group may be particularly amenable to smoking cessation efforts.

Abstract:Ureaplasma urealyticum is a common inhabitant of mucosal surfaces but is also associated with a higher incidence of pneumonia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. Culture and polymerase chain reaction demonstrate high isolation rates of ureaplasma in clinical specimens documenting their presence but do not associate the organism directly with the diseased tissue. In this study, lung tissue samples from newborn mice inoculated intranasally with U. urealyticum were used to develop an in situ hybridization (ISH) test for the organism. In situ hybridization allows the localization of gene expression for visualization within the context of tissue morphology. New techniques which use biotinyl-tyramide based signal amplification have been able to greatly enhance the sensitivity of ISH. Using the Dako GenPoint Catalyzed Signal Amplification system to detect a biotinylated DNA probe specific for an internal nucleotide sequence within the urease gene of U. urealyticum, the organism was detected within the infected murine lung tissues. Electron microscopy was used to verify the presence of the organisms in the positive ISH areas. The ISH procedure developed in this study can be used to analyze the presence of ureaplasma in human neonatal lung tissue with the corresponding histopathology.

Abstract:Infants with Ureaplasma urealyticum in the lower respiratory tract are at risk for chronic lung disease (CLD) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) but causality has been difficult to prove. The goal of this study was to identify ureaplasma in human neonatal lung tissue using the in situ hybridization (ISH) procedure described in Part 1 (Exp. Mol. Pathol., in press) of this report. By correlating their presence with the histopathologic findings, it may be possible to provide further evidence of the pathogenicity of ureaplasmas and their association with BPD. Lung autopsy tissue from seven infants with positive cultures and seven infants with negative cultures for ureaplasma were included in the study. All culture-positive infants were positive for ureaplasma on ISH and all had histopathologic evidence of BPD. Two of the seven infants with negative cultures were positive for ureaplasma with ISH. Of interest, these two infants were also found to have BPD at autopsy. The other five infants with negative cultures were also negative for ureaplasma on ISH and had no evidence of BPD. This study correlates the presence of U. urealyticum by ISH with the finding of BPD on histopathologic evaluation and provides evidence that it has a role in the development of CLD.

Title:Improving dietitians' teaching skills.

Abstract:Many health professionals lack important teaching skills, perhaps adding to patient difficulties in understanding and adopting therapeutic diets. Research suggests that teaching skills improved after dietitians took a continuing education course entitled "Effective Patient Teaching." Our study tested whether dietitians' new skills would persist in the field and whether selected patient outcomes would differ as a result. Thirty staff dietitians from six urban hospitals were videotaped teaching patients, then randomly assigned to take the Effective Patient Teaching course or not (control group). Follow-up videotapes were made after 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. After each teaching session, patient satisfaction and recall were assessed. Two judges rated 20 teaching skills, which were divided into four subsets for analysis. Repeated measures analyses of variance showed overall gains only for the group that took the Effective Patient Teaching course, which scored higher than the control group at 1 week and 1 month, but not at baseline or 3 months. Gains occurred in presentation skills and essential teaching functions. Throughout the study, interpersonal skills were high and adherence promotion skills were low for dietitians in both groups. Groups did not differ on patient satisfaction or recall. Improvements in dietitians' teaching skills translated to the field immediately after they completed the continuing education program, but not all gains were sustained after 3 months. We recommend that dietitians assess their teaching and adherence promotion skills, obtain training where warranted, and periodically reassess the application of those skills during patient teaching sessions.

Abstract:Current streambank restoration efforts focus on providing bank stability, enhancing water quality, and improving woody habitat using native vegetation rather than traditional engineering techniques. However, in most cases harsh site conditions limit restoration success. A two-year field study was conducted at Twentymile Creek, in northern Mississippi, investigating edaphic factors governing the survival of black willow (Salix nigra) cuttings used for streambank restoration. Low height growth, above-ground biomass production, and average leaf area were observed in willow cuttings grown in plots subjected to moisture deficits. However, sediment texture emerged as the dominant factor determining willow post growth, health, and survival. Shoot biomass, leaf biomass, and total above-ground biomass were 15-, 10-, and 14-fold greater for large willow cuttings (posts) grown in plots with sandy sediments relative to those grown in plots with similar moisture and soil redox potential but with silt and clay sediments. Average leaf size, average leaf mass and specific leaf area were all lower in fine textured plots. Under moisture conditions present at our sites, coarse-grained sediment (sand) was more conducive to willow growth, biomass production, and survival than were fine-grained sediments (silt/clay). Our results strongly suggest that soil texture and moisture conditions can determine restoration success. Therefore, it is critical that site conditions are factored into the selection of project locations prior to the initiation of willow planting restoration projects.

Title:Determination of the activation energies of and aggregate rates for exothermic physico-chemical changes in UHMWPE by isothermal heat-conduction microcalorimetry (IHCMC).
Authors:['Hardison A', 'Lewis G', 'Daniels AU', 'Smith RA']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Exothermic heat flow rates (Q=microW=microJ/s), as a function of elapsed time, were measured by isothermal heat-conduction microcalorimetry (IHCMC) in order to study the aggregate rate of physico-chemical change in specimens of unsterilized and sterilized ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Standard protocols for performing the IHCMC tests were developed and are described. Use of the standard protocols yielded the desired results-data that were not significantly different among either replicate sets of unsterilized specimens or as a function of which calorimeter test well was used. Heat flow rates measured in air at 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 35 degrees C, and 45 degrees C yielded estimates of activation energies of 47, 11, and 41 kJ/mol for unsterilized, gamma-radiation sterilized, and ethylene oxide gas (EtO) sterilized polymer, respectively. These results support the ideas that (a). initial exothermic degradation takes place much more easily in the radiation-sterilized material, due to direct oxidation of readily available free radicals, and (b). the much slower degradation process in EtO-sterilized UHMWPE is not appreciably different than in unsterilized polymer. Comparison with other activation energy data suggests that the rate-limiting process in EtO- or un-sterilized polymer is oxygen diffusion into the polymer. For shelf storage in air, for periods up to 8 months, the mean exothermic heat flow in air, at 25 degrees C (Q(m)) [determined from the Q values averaged over the time period between 15 and 20 h after test start], from UHMWPE gamma-radiation sterilized in air was significantly higher than for unsterilized material (2.91+/-0.11 vs. 0.73+/-0.11 microW). The higher rate can be attributed to oxidation of radiation-induced free radicals in the polymer near its surface. For the gamma-irradiated polymer, the decline in Q(m) with shelf storage time suggests that, eventually, degradation might become oxygen diffusion limited in this case also. However, in vivo, surface wear of an UHMWPE articular component may continue to expose unoxidized free radicals, keeping the exothermic reaction rate high and, possibly, continuing to produce an oxidized UHMWPE surface prone to wear.

Title:Chronic intermittent injections of high-dose ethanol during adolescence produce metabolic, hypnotic, and cognitive tolerance in rats.
Authors:['Silvers JM', 'Tokunaga S', 'Mittleman G', 'Matthews DB']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Many humans are first exposed to ethanol during adolescence, the time at which they are most likely to binge drink ethanol. Chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure produces ethanol tolerance in adolescent rodents. Recent studies suggested that adolescent animals administered CIE experienced increased cognitive impairment following an ethanol challenge. These studies further explore development of ethanol tolerance caused by CIE in adolescence, and whether CIE during adolescence leads to altered ethanol response in adulthood. METHODS: Beginning postnatal day (P) 30, adolescent rats were administered 5.0 g/kg ethanol or saline every 48 hours for 20 days. In experiment I, animals were tested for differential weight gain. In experiment II, loss of righting reflex (LORR) was observed after each injection, then at completion of pretreatment all animals were tested with 5.0 g/kg ethanol and LORR was observed. In experiment III, blood ethanol levels were observed and elimination rates calculated after the first and fifth pretreatments. All animals were tested with 5.0 g/kg at completion of pretreatment and elimination rates were recalculated. In experiment IV, animals were trained on the spatial version of the Morris Water Maze Task (MWMT) on non-treatment days. Following completion of pretreatment and training, animals were tested after receiving an ethanol (1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 g/kg), or saline. Tests for experiments II, III, and IV were repeated in the same animals following 12 ethanol-free days. RESULTS: Chronic intermittent ethanol exposure during adolescence caused differential weight gain (experiment I). Adolescent rats developed tolerance to ethanol-induced LORR (experiment II) and metabolic tolerance to ethanol (experiment III). This tolerance was seen after 12 ethanol-free days. CIE also attenuated ethanol-induced spatial memory deficits in the MWMT (experiment IV). This effect was not long-lasting. CONCLUSIONS: Following CIE pretreatment during adolescence, tolerance developed to the hypnotic and cognitive impairing effects of ethanol, along with increased metabolic rate and decreased weight gain. These results further emphasize the ability of CIE to produce a variety of effects during adolescence, some having long-lasting consequences.

Abstract:Puma encodes a BH3-only protein that is induced by the p53 tumor suppressor and other apoptotic stimuli. To assess its physiological role in apoptosis, we generated Puma knockout mice by gene targeting. Here we report that Puma is essential for hematopoietic cell death triggered by ionizing radiation (IR), deregulated c-Myc expression, and cytokine withdrawal. Puma is also required for IR-induced death throughout the developing nervous system and accounts for nearly all of the apoptotic activity attributed to p53 under these conditions. These findings establish Puma as a principal mediator of cell death in response to diverse apoptotic signals, implicating Puma as a likely tumor suppressor.

Abstract:Surface topography, microstructure, and micromechanical properties of human lamellar bone were characterized by atomic force microscopy and nanoindentation. The lamellar bone surfaces were prepared by two different methods: microtome sectioning and mechanical polishing. The lamellar bone surfaces prepared by mechanical polishing revealed that thin lamellae formed depressions approximately 200 nm deep, whereas the surfaces prepared by microtome sectioning were flat. Atomic force microscopy surface topographic images at higher magnification showed differences between thick and thin lamellae in polished samples, but these differences were less pronounced in microtomed samples. Roughness measurements confirmed that there was a significant difference between thick (21.0 nm) and thin lamellae (8.3 nm) in polished samples (p < 0.001). The difference in surface roughness between thick (13.9 nm) and thin lamellae (12.7 nm) in microtomed sample was statistically insignificant (p = 0.74). Higher elastic modulus values were observed for thick lamella in microtomed samples compared with that of thin lamellae, whereas measured elastic modulus differences between thick and thin lamellae in polished samples were found to be statistically insignificant.

Title:Interaction of myeloperoxidase with vascular NAD(P)H oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species in vasculature: implications for vascular diseases.

Abstract:Vascular NAD(P)H oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have emerged as important molecules in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetic vascular complications. Additionally, myeloperoxidase (MPO), a transcytosable heme protein that is derived from leukocytes, is also believed to play important roles in the above-mentioned inflammatory vascular diseases. Previous studies have shown that MPO-induced vascular injury responses are H2O2 dependent. It is well known that MPO can use leukocyte-derived H2O2; however, it is unknown whether the vascular-bound MPO can use vascular nonleukocyte oxidase-derived H2O2 to induce vascular injury. In the present study, ANG II was used to stimulate vascular NAD(P)H oxidases and increase their H2O2 production in the vascular wall, and vascular dysfunction was used as the vascular injury parameter. We demonstrated that vascular-bound MPO has sustained activity in the vasculature. MPO could use the vascular NAD(P)H oxidase-derived H2O2 to produce hypochlorus acid (HOCl) and its chlorinating species. More importantly, MPO derived HOCl and chlorinating species amplified the H2O2-induced vascular injury by additional impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation. HOCl-modified low-density lipoprotein protein (LDL), a specific biomarker for the MPO-HOCl-chlorinating species pathway, was expressed in LDL and MPO-bound vessels with vascular NAD(P)H oxidase-derived H2O2. MPO-vascular NAD(P)H oxidase-HOCl-chlorinating species may represent a common pathogenic pathway in vascular diseases and a new mechanism involved in exacerbation of vascular diseases under inflammatory conditions.

Abstract:The Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) is a self-report questionnaire that is used to quantify the impact of a hearing problem on an individual's daily life. In this investigation, the relationships were explored between typical clinical audiometric data and the four subscale scores of the APHAB administered in the unaided (without-amplification) condition. Sixty subjects provided APHAB scores, audiograms, and speech recognition data. Analyses revealed significant relationships between audiometric data and each of the three APHAB subscales that reflect speech communication (EC, RV, and BN). None of these subscales was significantly more strongly related to any specific audiological variable. However, the pattern of associations between audiometric variables and subscale scores was consistent with predictions based on item content for subscales EC and RV, but not for BN. As predicted, no relationship was found between audiometric data and scores for the Aversiveness subscale (AV). Even for the subscales with the strongest associations, differences in audiometric data could be used to explain half or less of the variance in self-report data.

Title:The cerebellum and spatial ability: dissection of motor and cognitive components with a mouse model system.

Abstract:The cerebellum has recently been linked to spatial navigation, as indicated by the inferior performance of cerebellar mutant or cerebellar lesioned animals in the water maze. The inability to dissociate motor from cognitive deficits in the impaired water maze performance has been a confounding variable in previous studies, however. In this study, we sought to define clearly the role of the cerebellar system in spatial navigation outside of motor control by creating a mouse model of Purkinje cell loss with intact motor ability, and testing these mice in the water maze. To this end, we made aggregation chimeras between Lc/+ mice, which lose all Purkinje cells postnatally, and +/+ control mice. Lc/+ mice are ataxic and show impaired rotor-rod performance. By contrast, we show that Lc/+ left arrow over right arrow +/+ chimeras above a threshold of Purkinje cell loss show no outward signs of motor impairment and demonstrated normal rotor-rod ability. In the water maze, we found that Lc/+ mice showed impaired performance in the place, cue and platform removal tasks, whereas Lc/+ left arrow over right arrow +/+ chimeras performed similarly to controls in all tasks. We found that the impaired performance in the water maze of Lc/+ mice resulted from both motor as well as cognitive impairment that could be separated from one another by statistical means. In addition, through the analysis of individual chimeric mice, the relationships between these deficits and the total number of Purkinje cells were determined and a specific role for Purkinje cells in search strategy was identified.

Title:Effect of rest interval length on repeated 1 repetition maximum back squats.
Authors:['Matuszak ME', 'Fry AC', 'Weiss LW', 'Ireland TR', 'McKnight MM']
Affiliation:Human Performance Laboratories, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:To examine the effects of different rest intervals on the repeatability of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) efforts in the free-weight back squat exercise, 17 weight-trained men served as subjects (mean age 22.0 years). One repetition maximum was tested on each of the first 2 days of testing to establish a stable baseline (1RM = 184.9 kg). Each of the next 3 sessions involved performing 2 1RM back squats, with the rest interval between attempted lifts being either 1, 3, or 5 minutes, assigned in a counterbalanced fashion. For the 1-minute rest interval, 13 of 17 subjects successfully completed the second lift; for the 3-minute rest interval, 16 of 17 were successful; and for the 5-minute rest interval, 15 of 17 were successful. Cochran Q analysis determined no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the ability to repeat a successful maximal-effort back squat when different rest intervals were used. These findings are consistent with the literature for the bench-press exercise and indicate that 1-minute rest intervals are sufficient for recovery between attempted lifts during 1RM testing or training for the free-weight back squat when involving lifters of this caliber.

Title:Effect of knee position on hip and knee torques during the barbell squat.
Authors:['Fry AC', 'Smith JC', 'Schilling BK']
Affiliation:Human Performance Laboratories, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. afry@memphis.edu
Abstract:UNLABELLED: Some recommendations suggest keeping the shank as vertical as possible during the barbell squat, thus keeping the knees from moving past the toes. This study examined joint kinetics occurring when forward displacement of the knees is restricted vs. when such movement is not restricted. Seven weight-trained men (mean +/- SD; age = 27.9 +/- 5.2 years) were videotaped while performing 2 variations of parallel barbell squats (barbell load = body weight). Either the knees were permitted to move anteriorly past the toes (unrestricted) or a wooden barrier prevented the knees from moving anteriorly past the toes (restricted). Differences resulted between static knee and hip torques for both types of squat as well as when both squat variations were compared with each other (p < 0.05). For the unrestricted squat, knee torque (N.m; mean +/- SD) = 150.1 +/- 50.8 and hip torque = 28.2 +/- 65.0. For the restricted squat, knee torque = 117.3 +/- 34.2 and hip torque = 302.7 +/- 71.2. Restricted squats also produced more anterior lean of the trunk and shank and a greater internal angle at the knees and ankles. The squat technique used can affect the distribution of forces between the knees and hips and on the kinematic properties of the exercise. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Although restricting forward movement of the knees may minimize stress on the knees, it is likely that forces are inappropriately transferred to the hips and low-back region. Thus, appropriate joint loading during this exercise may require the knees to move slightly past the toes.

Title:Subtractive hybridization identifies a novel predicted protein mediating epithelial cell invasion by virulent serotype III group B Streptococcus agalactiae.

Abstract:Group B Streptococcus agalactiae bacteria (group B streptococci [GBS]) are the most common cause of serious bacterial infection in newborn infants. The majority of serotype III-related cases of neonatal disease are caused by a genetically related subgroup of bacteria, restriction fragment digest pattern (RDP) type III-3, suggesting that these strains possess unique genes contributing to virulence. We used genomic subtractive hybridization to identify regions of genomic DNA unique to virulent RDP type III-3 GBS strains. Within one of these III-3-specific regions is a 1,506-bp open reading frame, spb1 (surface protein of group B streptococcus 1). A mutant type III GBS strain lacking Spb1 was constructed in virulent RDP type III-3 strain 874391, and the interactions of the wild-type and spb1 isogenic mutant with a variety of epithelial cells important to GBS colonization and infection were compared. While adherence of the spb1 isogenic mutant to A549 respiratory, C2Bbe1 colonic, and HeLa cervical epithelial cells was slightly lower than that of the 874391 strain, invasion of the Spb1(-) mutant was significantly reduced with these cell lines compared to what was seen with 874391. The defect in epithelial invasion was corrected by supplying spb1 in trans. These observations suggest that Spb1 contributes to the pathogenesis of neonatal GBS infection by mediating internalization of virulent serotype III GBS and confirm that understanding of the population structure of bacteria may lead to insights into the pathogenesis of human infections.

Title:Effect of fabrication pressure on the fatigue performance of Cemex XL acrylic bone cement.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Janna SI']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, 316 Engineering Science Building, Memphis, TN 38152-3180, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:During a cemented arthroplasty, the prepared polymerizing dough of acrylic bone cement is subjected to pressurization in a number of ways; first, during delivery into the freshly prepared bone bed, second, during packing in that bed (either digitally or with the aid of a mechanical device), and, third, during the insertion of the prosthesis. Only a few studies have reported on the influence of the level of pressurization experienced during these events (which, depending on the cementing technique used, has been put at between 8 and 273 kPa) on various properties of the cement. That was the focus of the present study, in which the fully reversed tension-compression (+/-15 MPa; 5 Hz) fatigue lives (expressed as number of cycles to fracture, N(f)) of rectangular cross-sectioned "dog-bone" specimens (Type V, per ASTM D 638) fabricated from Cemex XL cement, at pressure applied continuously to the cement dough during curing in the specimen mold, p=75,150, and 300 kPa, were determined. The N(f) results were analyzed using the linearized transformation of the three-parameter Weibull relationship to obtain estimates of the Weibull mean, N(WM), which was taken to be the index of fatigue performance of the specimen set. Over the range of p studied, N(WM) increased as p increased (for example, from 329,118 cycles when p was 75 kPa to 388,496 cycles when p was 300 kPa); however, the increase was not significant over any pair of p increment steps (Mann-Whitney U-test; alpha<0.05).

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a school based smoking cessation programme among students caught smoking at school. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial comparing cessation rates among students in a behavioural cessation programme and those receiving self help materials only. SETTING: Eighteen schools in the Memphis, Tennessee area. SUBJECTS: Two hundred and sixty one adolescent cigarette smokers (166 male, 95 female) averaging 15.8 years of age. INTERVENTION: Students assigned to the intervention received a four session behavioural treatment programme administered individually by a health educator. In addition, these students received stage matched intervention in brief phone calls monthly until the one year follow up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Self reported and biochemically verified smoking cessation at post-test and 12 month follow up. RESULTS: Recruiting students who were caught smoking at school proved to be highly successful. Participants rated the programme favourably, and retention rates were high. Although treated participants improved more in tobacco related knowledge relative to controls (p = 0.002), there were no group differences in changes in attitudes toward smoking. In addition, treated and control participants demonstrated no significant differences in cessation rates both at post-test and follow up. Comparisons between self reported cessation rates and those obtained under bogus pipeline conditions or with biochemical verification suggested significant falsification of cessation among participants. CONCLUSIONS: Our results failed to demonstrate any significant effect of the cessation programme on smoking rates for treated adolescents compared with controls. Our findings also highlight the importance of utilising strong methodology in research on adolescent smoking cessation, including control groups and biochemical verification of smoking status.

Abstract:The International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) is a seven-item survey that was developed for use in research settings to facilitate comparison of data across diverse investigations. The inventory also has potential applications in clinical evaluation of hearing aid fitting outcomes. This article reports the development of norms for the inventory that are suitable for use with group data in research applications, and individual data in a clinical setting. The normative group was defined as adults fitted bilaterally with analog, single-channel, single-memory, compression processing, in-the-ear hearing aids. There were 154 subjects. Associations between outcomes and demographic variables (e.g., gender, hearing loss, etc.) were explored, and several relationships were seen. Based on these data, two sets of norms were derived. The appropriate set will depend on the individual's reported subjective hearing problems without amplification.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, etiology and outcome of graft failure in pediatric allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with primary or secondary graft failure were identified by database review. A retrospective chart review was performed. Etiologic factors were identified and assessed for statistical significance. RESULTS: 309 children underwent allogeneic BMT during the time interval studied. Four cases of primary graft failure and 7 cases of secondary graft failure occurred. Nonmalignant diagnosis, lower total nucleated cell (TNC) dose, and conditioning without total body irradiation were associated with a higher incidence of graft failure. Donor source, donor/recipient CMV status, CD34+ cell dose, and alloimmunization were not associated with graft failure. CONCLUSIONS: Graft failure is a relatively uncommon occurrence in pediatric patients. Autologous reinfusion may allow time to prepare the patient for a second transplant and decrease complications associated with aplasia. More immunosuppressive conditioning regimens may decrease the incidence of graft failure, particularly in patients with non-malignant diseases or those with lower stem cell doses. More frequent monitoring of chimerism by VNTR analysis may detect late graft failure earlier and allow for more rapid intervention.

Abstract:Biopsies fro the vastus lateralis muscle of male weightlifters (WL; n=6; X +/- SE, age=27.0 +/- 2.1 years), and non-weight-trained men (CON; n=7; age=27.0 +/- 2.0 years) were compared for fiber types, myosin heavy chain (MHC) and titin content, and fiber type-specific capillary density. Differences (p<0.05) were observed for percent fiber types IIC (WL=0.4 +/- 0.2, CON=2.4 +/- 0.8); IIA (WL=50.5 +/- 3.2, CON=26.9 +/- 3.7); and IIB (WL=1.7 +/- 1.4, CON=21.0 +/- 5.3), as well as percent MHC IIa (WL=65.3 +/- 2.4, CON=52.1 +/- 4.2) and percent MHC IIB (WL=0.9 +/- 0.9; CON=18.2 +/- 6.1). All WL exhibited only the titin-1 isoform. Capillary density (caps.mm(-2)) for all fiber types combined was greater for the CON subjects (WL=192.7 +/- 17.3; CON=262.9 +/- 26.3), due primarily to a greater capillary density in the IIA fibers. Weightlifting performances and vertical jump power were correlated with type II fiber characteristics. These results suggest that successful weightlifting performance is not dependent on IIB fibers, and that weightlifters exhibit large percentages of type IIA muscle fibers and MHC IIa isoform content.

Abstract:The channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) is extensively used in aquaculture in the Southeast US and is susceptible to many bacterial infections acquired from its pond environment. Research is needed to better understand the defensive response and innate immunity of channel catfish against fish pathogens like Edwardsiella ictaluri and Aeromonas hydrophila. The main objectives were purification and characterization of an innate antimicrobial factor isolated from catfish leucocytes that has both bactericidal and antiviral activities. Oxygen-independent mechanisms of innate immunity for killing microorganisms have not been identified in leucocytes of channel catfish. Leucocytes were separated from catfish blood, and granule extracts were obtained by homogenization, centrifugation, and extraction with 10% acetic acid. The granule extracts were further purified by gel filtration chromatography. Bactericidal assays against the two fish pathogens and SDS-PAGE analysis were done on the isolated antimicrobial factor. Determination of antiviral activity of the factor was done by in vitro tissue culture using herpes simplex virus-type 1. Mass spectrometry analyses were done for molecular weight (655 Da), purity, and structural characterization of the innate non-peptide antimicrobial factor.

Abstract:Lipid phosphate phosphatase 1 (LPP-1) is presumed to regulate the balance between lipid phosphates and their dephosphorylated counterparts. The currently prevailing hypothesis based on in vitro studies proposes that LPP-1 should regulate phospholipid lipid growth factors and second messengers, including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), diacylglycerol (DAG), and phosphatidic acid (PA). To evaluate the role of LPP-1 in vivo, three transgenic lines were established. RT-PCR, Western blotting, and enzymatic activity measurement confirmed a copy number-dependent ubiquitous overexpression of LPP-1. PMA-stimulated PA production in immortalized LPP-1 fibroblasts led to an elevation in the accumulation of DAG without major changes in the phospholipid classes isolated from the liver. The LPP-1 phenotype showed reduced body size, birth weight, and abnormalities in fur growth, whereas histological abnormalities included significantly decreased number of hair follicles, disrupted hair structure, and a severely impaired spermatogenesis. Implantation of LPP-1 or wild-type embryos into pseudopregnant LPP-1 mothers yielded a reduced litter size. The plasma level of alanine-leucine aminotransferase was significantly elevated. Unexpectedly, plasma concentrations of the five major acyl-species of LPA were indistinguishable between wild-type and LPP-1 animals. In contrast with previous studies using plasmid-mediated overexpression in vitro, transgenic overexpression of LPP-1 did not affect ERK1/2 activation elicited by LPA, S1P, thrombin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which was presumed to be a major signaling event regulated by LPP-1. Thus, transgenic overexpression of LPP-1 in mice elicited a number of unexpected phenotypic alterations without affecting several aspects of LPA signaling, which point to previously unappreciated mechanisms and roles of lipid phosphates in select organs.

Title:Quantitative and graphic acoustic analysis of phonatory modulations: the modulogram.
Authors:['Buder EH', 'Strand EA']
Affiliation:School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38104, USA. ehbuder@memphis.edu
Abstract:A method is presented for analyzing phonatory instabilities that occur as modulations of fundamental frequency (f0) and sound pressure level (SPL) on the order of 0.2 to 20 cycles per second. Such long-term phonatory instabilities, including but not limited to traditional notions of tremor, are distinct from cycle-to-cycle perturbation such as jitter or shimmer. For each of the 2 parameters (f0, in Hz, and SPL, in dB), 3 frequency domains are proposed: (a) flutter (10-20 Hz), (b) tremor (2-10 Hz), and (c) wow (0.2-2.0 Hz), yielding 6 types of instability. Analyses were implemented using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) with domain-specific analysis parameters. Outputs include a graphic display in the form of a set of low-frequency spectrograms (the "modulogram") and quantitative measures of the frequencies, magnitudes, durations, and sinusoidal form of the instabilities. An index of a given instability is developed by combining its duration and average modulation magnitude into a single quantity. Performance of the algorithms was assessed by analyzing test signals with known degrees of modulation, and a range of applications was reviewed to provide a rationale for use of modulograms in phonatory assessment.

Abstract:Pancreatic beta cells play a central role in maintaining glucose homeostasis because they secrete insulin in response to increased level of blood glucose; failure of this capacity constitutes a major component of the pathogenesis of diabetes. The identification of key regulators of pancreatic beta-cell differentiation is relevant for the overall understanding of this process and for future experiments aimed at regenerating insulin-producing beta cells from pancreatic or embryonic stem cells. Several studies using transgenic or knockout mice have established that the development and function of pancreatic beta cells are controlled by several genes encoding specific transcription factors. By inactivating the homeobox gene Pax4, we previously demonstrated that its function is required for the formation of mature insulin-producing cells. Here, we show that during pancreas ontogeny, Pax4 is expressed in differentiating endocrine cells, including beta cells. Pax4 activity appears essential for appropriate initiation of beta-cell differentiation because loss of Pax4 prevents the expression of Pdx1, HB9 and insulin in beta-cell precursors. This role of Pax4 appears to be accomplished via its genetic interaction with another homeobox gene, Nkx2.2.

Abstract:In four separate studies, the effect of three methods used to highly crosslink ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) (gamma irradiation, electron beam irradiation, and peroxide treatment) on the polymer's stiffness was investigated using quasi-static and dynamic nanoindentation. From the quasi-static studies, it was found that (a) the highest value of the elastic modulus, E (2240 +/- 157 MPa) was obtained from specimens prepared from direct compression molded UHMWPE crosslinked using gamma irradiation, with a dosage of 7.5 Mrad; (b) the value of E for specimens formed from direct compression molded UHMWPE was higher (1950 +/- 255 MPa) compared to results obtained from specimens formed from ram extruded UHMWPE (1583 +/- 140 MPa); and (c) the magnitude of the decrease in the value of E as a result of subjecting a highly crosslinked UHMWPE specimen to uniaxial tensile forces depends on the method used for the crosslinking. From the dynamic study, (d) it was found that the extent of the change in both the storage modulus and the loss modulus, as a result of subjecting a highly crosslinked UHMWPE specimen to uniaxial tension forces, depends on the method used for the crosslinking.

Title:Place specific influences on the wave I to V interpeak latency of the auditory brain-stem response.
Authors:['Zapala DA', 'Gould HJ', 'Mendel MI']
Affiliation:Department of Audiology, Methodist Hospitals of Memphis, Tennessee 38104.
Abstract:There is controversy over whether the wave I to V interpeak latency (I-V IPL) of the auditory brain-stem response can be manipulated by cochlear processing. In this study, a forward masking paradigm was used to test the predictions of two contrasting models of I-V IPL generation. The paradigm was designed to determine if the I-V IPL can be affected by masking selected portions of the cochlear response region. The results from ten normal hearing subjects suggest that: (1) waves I and V can be masked semi-independent of each other, and (2) the I-V IPL can be shortened or prolonged by masking the basal or apical portion of the cochlear response region respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that, at least in normal hearing subjects, wave V is biased to reflect more apical cochlear events than wave I. Additionally, they offer tentative support for anecdotal reports of shortened I-V IPLs in the presence of high-frequency hearing loss.

Abstract:The purpose of this investigation was to determine if speech intelligibility improved when divers made specific modifications to their speaking patterns while in a hyperbaric helium-oxygen (heliox) environment. Divers were trained to produce a variety of sentences using speech with three types of alterations: (1) slowed rate, (2) increased loudness, and (3) a combination of slightly slowed rate, a minimal increase in loudness, increased pause time, and greater mouth opening (composite strategy). Both diver and non-diver listeners judged these sentences for intelligibility. In addition, acoustic analysis of the cues for the identification of voicing, place, and manner of articulation was conducted to determine if such cues might become more audible in the speech signal when repair strategies were used. Both perceptual and acoustic results showed the composite method to be the best for natural-sounding, intelligible speech. It had the effect of slowing rate and increasing loudness just enough to increase intelligibility without causing distortion. It was concluded that teaching divers to produce speech using this method would be a worthwhile investment for improving speech intelligibility.

Abstract:The goal of the present work was to investigate the influence of the viscosity classification of an acrylic bone cement on its in vitro fatigue performance, as determined in fully-reversed tension-compression (+/-15 MPa) fatigue tests. The test matrix comprised six commercially available bone cements [Orthoset1, (OS1), Orthoset(R)3 (OS3), CemexRX (CRX), Cemex XL (CXL), Palacos R (PR) and Osteopal (OP)], two methods of mixing the cement constituents (hand-mixing and vacuum-mixing), two methods of fabricating the test specimens (direct molding and molding followed by machining), two specimen cross-sectional shapes (rectangular or "flat" and circular or "round"), and four test frequencies (1, 2, 5, and 10 Hz). In total, 185 specimens, distributed among 20 sets, were tested. The test results (number of fatigue stress cycles, N_f) were processed using the linearized transformation of the three-parameter Weibull distribution, whence estimates of the Weibull mean, N_[WM], were obtained. Statistical analysis of the ln N_f results (Mann-Whitney test; alpha<0.05) and a comparison of the N_[WM] estimates for specimen sets in which the formulations have essentially the same composition but different viscosity classification (namely, OS1 versus OS3, CRX versus CXL, and PR versus OP) showed that, in the majority of the comparisons carried out, the viscosity classification of a bone cement does not exert a significant influence on its in vitro fatigue performance.

Abstract:The study utilized the geometric element analysis method to investigate the effect of three variables (head diameter, d; head material; and neck material) on the y-direction displacement, due to fretting (delta), in a model of the head-neck connection in a modular version of the femoral component of a hip implant, subjected to a resultant hip joint force only. It was found that while d and neck material exerted a strong effect on delta, the head material had practically no such effect. The implications of this finding for design and materials selection issues for this connection are discussed.

Abstract:A series of nonsteroidal ligands were synthesized as second-generation agonists for the androgen receptor (AR). These ligands were designed to eliminate metabolic sites identified in one of our first-generation AR agonists, which was inactive in vivo due to its rapid metabolism to inactive constituents. The binding affinity of these compounds was evaluated using AR isolated from rat ventral prostate. These second-generation compounds bound the AR in a high affinity and stereoselective manner, with K(i) values ranging from about 4 to 130 nM. The ability of these ligands to stimulate AR-mediated transcriptional activation was examined in cells transfected with the human AR and a hormone-dependent luciferase reporter gene. Although some compounds were unable to stimulate AR-mediated transcription, several demonstrated activity similar to that of dihydrotestosterone (DHT, an endogenous steroidal ligand for the AR). We also evaluated the in vivo pharmacologic activity of selected compounds in castrated male rats. Three compounds were identified as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), exhibiting significant anabolic activity while having only moderate to minimal androgenic activity in vivo.

Title:Speech perception benefits from sound field FM amplification.
Authors:['Mendel LL', 'Roberts RA', 'Walton JH']
Affiliation:School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. lmendel@memphis.edu
Abstract:The effects of sound field FM amplification (SFA) on speech perception performance were investigated in this 2-year study. Kindergarten children with normal hearing were randomly assigned to a treatment group, which comprised 7 classrooms that had SFA systems installed in them, and to a control group, which comprised another 7 classrooms that did not have any amplification available. The children were followed from the beginning of kindergarten through the end of first grade. Improvements in speech perception performance were measured for both groups, with the treatment group demonstrating progress much sooner than the control group. However, this difference was not apparent by the end of the study. The only significant difference measured between the treatment and control groups was that the treatment group performed significantly better than the control group when the stimuli were presented with SFA for the treatment group and without SFA for the control group. The teachers who used SFA enjoyed using amplification in their classrooms and felt that their students enjoyed using it as well.

Title:Molecular modeling of CPT-11 metabolism by carboxylesterases (CEs): use of pnb CE as a model.

Abstract:CPT-11 is a prodrug that is converted in vivo to the topoisomerase I poison SN-38 by carboxylesterases (CEs). Among the CEs studied thus far, a rabbit liver CE (rCE) converts CPT-11 to SN-38 most efficiently. Despite extensive sequence homology, however, the human homologues of this protein, hCE1 and hiCE, metabolize CPT-11 with significantly lower efficiencies. To understand these differences in drug metabolism, we wanted to generate mutations at individual amino acid residues to assess the effects of these mutations on CPT-11 conversion. We identified a Bacillus subtilis protein (pnb CE) that could be used as a model for the mammalian CEs. We demonstrated that pnb CE, when expressed in Escherichia coli, metabolizes both the small esterase substrate o-NPA and the bulky prodrug CPT-11. Furthermore, we found that the pnb CE and rCE crystal structures show an only 2.4 A rmsd variation over 400 residues of the alpha-carbon trace. Using the pnb CE model, we demonstrated that the "side-door" residues, S218 and L362, and the corresponding residues in rCE, L252 and L424, were important in CPT-11 metabolism. Furthermore, we found that at position 218 or 252 the size of the residue, and at position 362 or 424 the hydrophobicity and charge of the residue, were the predominant factors in influencing drug activation. The most significant change in CPT-11 metabolism was observed with the L424R variant rCE that converted 10-fold less CPT-11 than the wild-type protein. As a result, COS-7 cells expressing this mutant were 3-fold less sensitive to CPT-11 than COS-7 cells expressing the wild-type protein.

Title:Suppressing irrelevant information: knowledge activation or inhibition?
Authors:['McNamara DS', 'McDaniel MA']

Abstract:In 3 experiments, the authors examined the role of knowledge activation in the suppression of contextually irrelevant meanings for ambiguous homographs. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants with greater baseball knowledge, regardless of reading skill, more quickly suppressed the irrelevant meaning of ambiguous words in baseball-related, but not general-topic, sentences. Experiment 3 demonstrated that participants with greater general knowledge, regardless of reading skill, more quickly suppressed the irrelevant meaning of the ambiguous words in general-topic sentences. As predicted by D. S. McNamara's (1997) knowledge-based account of suppression, ambiguity effects are influenced by greater activation of knowledge related to the intended meaning of the homograph. These results challenge inhibition (e.g. M. A. Gernsbacher, K. R. Varner. & M. Faust, 1990) as the sole mechanism responsible for the suppression of irrelevant information.

Abstract:PURPOSE: Islet transplantation is limited by islet graft failure because of poor revascularization, host immune rejection, and nonspecific inflammatory response. Human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF) gene delivery is likely to promote islet revascularization and survival. METHODS: We evaluated gene expression from a bicistronic plasmid encoding hVEGF and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (pCMS-EGFP-hVEGF). Glucose responsiveness of islets was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo, and revascularization in islet graft was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: After transfection, hVEGF and EGFP expression levels were comparable with original monocistronic plasmids in Jurkat cells but higher and prolonged hVEGF expression in islets transfected with the bicistronic plasmid was observed, possibly as the result of differences in promoter strength and hypoxia response. The 3:1 w/w complexes showed little toxicity to islets at a dose of 5 microg DNA per 2000 islets. On glucose challenge, insulin release from transfected islets as well as secretion from islets after transplantation under the mouse kidney capsules in response to glucose stimulation, increased with time. Immunohistochemical staining of transplanted islets using mouse anti-human insulin, mouse anti-human von Willebrand factor, and rat anti-mouse CD31 antibodies suggests that islets are functional and there is new blood vessel formation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that transient hVEGF gene expression by the islets may promote islet revascularization and prolong islet survival after transplantation.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To develop, validate, and cross-validate a formula for predicting resting energy expenditure (REE) in African-American and European-American women. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of REE in women. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group served to develop and validate a new equation for predicting REE while the second was used to cross-validate the prediction equation. The accuracy of the equation was compared to several existing formulae. SETTING: University metabolic laboratory, Memphis, TN, USA. SUBJECTS: Healthy, premenopausal African-American and European-American women between 18 and 39 y of age. The validation sample included 239 women (age: 28.4 y, wt: 70.7 kg, body mass index (BMI): 25.2 kg/m(2), REE: 5840 kJ/day), while the cross-validation sample consisted of 232 women (age: 27.5 y, wt: 70.7 kg, BMI: 25.2 kg/m(2), REE: 5784 kJ/day). RESULTS: The prediction equation derived from the current sample, which included adjustments for ethnicity, was the only formula that demonstrated a high level of accuracy for predicting REE in both African-American and European-American women. The mean difference between REE predicted from the new formula and measured REE was 28 kJ/day (s.d.=668) for European-American women and 142 kJ/day (s.d.=584) for African-American women. CONCLUSIONS: Previous equations for predicting energy needs may not be appropriate for both African-American and European-American women due to ethnic differences in REE. A new equation that makes adjustments in predicted REE based on ethnicity is recommended for determining energy needs in these groups (Predicted REE (kJ/day)=616.93-14.9 (AGE (y))+35.12 (WT (kg))+19.83 (HT (cm))-271.88 (ETHNICITY: 1=African American; 0=European American)).

Abstract:Neointimal lesions are characterized by accumulation of cells within the arterial wall and are a prelude to atherosclerotic disease. Here we report that a brief exposure to either alkyl ether analogs of the growth factor-like phospholipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), products generated during the oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein, or to unsaturated acyl forms of LPA induce progressive formation of neointima in vivo in a rat carotid artery model. This effect is completely inhibited by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma antagonist GW9662 and mimicked by PPARgamma agonists Rosiglitazone and 1-O-hexadecyl-2-azeleoyl-phosphatidylcholine. In contrast, stearoyl-oxovaleryl phosphatidylcholine, a PPARalpha agonist and polypeptide epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor failed to elicit neointima. The structure-activity relationship for neointima induction by LPA analogs in vivo is identical to that of PPARgamma activation in vitro and disparate from that of LPA G protein-coupled receptor activation. Neointima-inducing LPA analogs up-regulated the CD36 scavenger receptor in vitro and in vivo and elicited dedifferentiation of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells that was prevented by GW9662. These results suggest that selected LPA analogs are important novel endogenous PPARgamma ligands capable of mediating vascular remodeling and that activation of the nuclear transcription factor PPARgamma is both necessary and sufficient for neointima formation by components of oxidized low density lipoprotein.

Title:Basic principles of the KIV model and its application to the navigation problem.
Authors:['Kozma R', 'Freeman WJ']
Affiliation:Division of Computer Science, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. rkozma@memphis.edu
Abstract:EEG measurements indicate the presence of common-mode, coherent oscillations shared by multiple cortical areas. In previous studies the KIII model has been introduced, which interprets the experimental observations as nonlinear, spatially distributed dynamical oscillations of locally coupled neural populations. KIII can account for the fast and robust classification and pattern recognition in sensory cortices. In order to describe selection of action, planning, and spatial orientation functions, in this paper we expand KIII into the KIV model. KIV approximates the operation of the corticostriatal-hippocampal system. KIV consists of three KI, eight KII and three KIII components, including sensory and cortical systems, as well as the hippocampus, amygdala, and the septum. KIV implements various types of dynamic neural activities. The neural activity patterns determine the emergence of global spatial encoding to implement the orientation function of a simulated animal. Our results indicate the mechanisms, which we believe support the generation of cognitive maps in the hippocampus based on the sensory input-based destabilization of cortical spatio-temporal patterns. In this paper, we describe the conceptual design of the KIV model. We outline the biological background and motivation of the basic principles that are applied to design the KIV computational model. We use the KIV model to explain how the hippocampal neural circuitry functions are constructed and controlled by the corticostriatal-hippocampal loops, supplemented with specific subcortical units. In the second part, we implement these principles using the example of the hippocampal formation as a KIII unit. We demonstrate the learning and navigation principles using the Evolving Multi-module Mobile Agent (EMMA) in 2D software environment.

Title:Discourse comprehension.

Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:The field of discourse processing has dissected many of the levels of representation that are constructed when individuals read or listen to connected discourse. These levels include the surface code, the propositional textbase, the referential situation model, the communication context, and the discourse genre. Discourse psychologists have developed models that specify how these levels are mentally represented and how they are dynamically built during comprehension. This chapter focuses on the meaning representations that are constructed when adults read written text, such as literary stories, technical expository text, and experimenter-generated "textoids." Recent psychological models have attempted to account for the identification of referents of referring expressions (e.g. which person in the text does she refer to), the connection of explicit text segments, the establishment of local and global coherence, and the encoding of knowledge-based inferences.

Abstract:In the recent memory, Jean Piaget has been known as a cognitive developmental psychologist. But in 1936 when Harvard gave him his first honorary degree, he was recognized mainly as a sociologist. Why did Harvard honor him in 1936? Who knew his work well enough to nominate him? This article will address these questions by exploring archival documents from different sources. Evidence draws our attention to a broad social and intellectual endeavor in philanthropy, other social sciences, and especially industrial research that brought Piaget across the water. This article also attempts to interpret the circumstances of the nomination process inside and outside of Harvard University by using a theory of institutional design. It suggests that embodied in Harvard's honor of Piaget in 1936 was an idealistic act in social designing for a future society.

Title:Behavioral assessment of gambling: an application of the timeline followback method.
Authors:['Weinstock J', 'Whelan JP', 'Meyers AW']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The Gambling Timeline Followback (G-TLFB), a measure of gambling behavior that uses the timeline followback methodology, was psychometrically evaluated with samples of frequent-gambling young adults. Seven dimensions of gambling behavior were assessed: type, frequency, duration, intent, risk, win-loss, and consumption of alcohol while gambling. The G-TLFB demonstrated adequate to excellent test-retest reliability with a sample of 57 frequent gamblers (r=.75 to.96) and with a group of 34 disordered gamblers (r=.73 to.93). With a separate sample of 58 frequent-gambling participants, convergent, concurrent, and discriminant validity were assessed. The G-TLFB correlated positively with daily self-monitoring reports (r=.59 to.87). The dimensions of frequency and duration demonstrated concurrent validity with gambling screening instruments, and standard drinks consumed while gambling demonstrated concurrent validity with a measure of alcohol misuse. The G-TLFB also demonstrated discriminant validity with demographic variables and a measure of positive impression management.

Title:Vibrational spectroscopic studies in the hydrolysis and condensation of chlorotrimethylsilane.
Authors:['Li YS', 'Le K']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. yingli@memphis.edu
Abstract:Raman and infrared spectroscopy were used to study the hydrolysis and condensation of chlorotrimethylsilane (CTMC) in aqueous organic solvents. From the recorded spectra and their intensity variation with time, we were able to identify trimethylsilanol as the reaction intermediate or the hydrolysis product as well as hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) as the final condensation product. The measured Raman intensity of CTMS at different time revealed that hydrolysis of CTMS is first order in terms of the CTMS concentration. From the Raman spectra collected under different conditions, it was noted that condensation reaction rates is faster in neutral condition than in acidic condition.

Title:Genetic correlates of gene expression in recombinant inbred strains: a relational model system to explore neurobehavioral phenotypes.

Abstract:Full genome sequencing, high-density genotyping, expanding sets of microarray assays, and systematic phenotyping of neuroanatomical and behavioral traits are producing a wealth of data on the mouse central nervous system (CNS). These disparate resources are still poorly integrated. One solution is to acquire these data using a common reference population of isogenic lines of mice, providing a point of integration between the data types. Recombinant inbred (RI) mice, derived through inbreeding of progeny from an inbred cross, are a powerful tool for complex trait mapping and analysis of the challenging phenotypes of neuroscientific interest. These isogenic RI lines are a retrievable genetic resource that can be repeatedly studied using a wide variety of assays. Diverse data sets can be related through fixed and known genomes, using tools such as the interactive web-based system for complex trait analysis, www.WebQTL.org. In this report, we demonstrate the use of WebQTL to explore complex interactions among a wide variety of traits--from mRNA transcripts to the impressive behavioral and pharmacological variation among RI strains. The relational approach exploiting a common set of strains facilitates study of multiple effects of single genes (pleiotropy) without a priori hypotheses required. Here we demonstrate the power of this technique through genetic correlation of gene expression with a database of neurobehavioral phenotypes collected in these strains of mice through more than 20 years of experimentation. By repeatedly studying the same panel of mice, early data can be re-examined in light of technological advances unforeseen at the time of their initial collection.

Title:Attenuation of neointima formation through the inhibition of DNA repair enzyme PARP-1 in balloon-injured rat carotid artery.

Abstract:Increased oxidative stress is a major characteristic of restenosis after angioplasty. The oxidative stress is mainly created by oxidants such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are assumed to play an important role in neointima formation after angioplasty. DNA is a sensitive target for oxidants; however, oxidative DNA damage remains a poorly examined field in the pathogenesis of restenosis. In the present study, we demonstrated that the expression of the oxidative DNA damage marker 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) was quickly increased in rat carotid arteries after balloon injury. It reached its peak at 14 days after injury and still kept high expression at 28 days after injury. The immunostaining of 8-oxo-dG was present predominantly in the neointima. In response to oxidative DNA damage, the DNA repair enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) was significantly increased after balloon injury. The time course change and location of PARP-1 is similar to that of 8-oxo-dG. Daily injections of the PARP-1 inhibitor PJ34 (5 mg.kg(-1).day(-1) ip) attenuated neointima formation by approximately 40% at 7, 14, and 28 days after balloon injury. Treatment with PJ34 inhibited leukocyte infiltration and improved both anatomic (reendothelialization) and functional (endothelial function) recovery of endothelial cells after balloon injury. In conclusion, levels of oxidative DNA damage and the DNA repair enzyme PARP-1 are increased in vessels after balloon injury. Inhibition of PARP-1 attenuates neointima formation through inhibition of leukocyte infiltration and improvement of endothelial cell recovery after balloon injury. Targeting of the DNA repair enzyme might be a therapeutic strategy for restenosis.

Title:Estimation of the minimum number of test specimens for fatigue testing of acrylic bone cement.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Sadhasivini A']

Abstract:In the literature on fatigue testing of acrylic bone cements, data sets of various sizes have been used in different test series for the same cement formulation. There are two important consequences of this situation. First, it means that some test series last much longer than others, with all the implications for the cost of testing. Second, it makes drawing conclusions about the fatigue performance of a cement, based on the results of different literature series, a problematic issue. Clearly then, a recommendation as to what should be the minimum number of test specimens to use that would allow for confidence in the results of the statistical treatment of the test results (Gmin) would be desirable. In the present work, a method that could be used to culminate in such a recommendation is described. This method involves (i) obtaining experimental fatigue test results and (ii) analyzing those results using the Weibull probability distribution function and other statistical methods. This methodology is illustrated using fatigue life results obtained from uniaxial tension-compression fatigue tests on specimens fabricated from the polymerizing dough of one commercially available acrylic bone cement. For a tolerable error of 5%, we estimated Gmin to be either 7 (if the fatigue life results are treated using the two-parameter Weibull distribution function) or 11 (if the fatigue life results are treated using the three-parameter Weibull distribution function). To be on the conservative side, we therefore recommend that Gmin be 11. Three key limitations of the methodology presented here are discussed.

Title:Influence of dihydrotestosterone on sex determination in channel catfish and blue catfish: period of developmental sensitivity.
Authors:['Davis KB', 'Goudie CA', 'Simco BA', 'Tiersch TR', 'Carmichael GJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:Treatment of channel catfish with 0.2, 20, or 200 mg/liter of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the water during the egg stage or during egg and sac-fry stages did not alter the expected 1:1 sex ratio of the progeny. Feeding DHT at 200 mg/kg of feed for the first 21 days after yolk sac absorption resulted in 80% females; this proportion was increased by combining feeding with treatment of 200 mg DHT/liter in the sac-fry stage (90%) or in the egg and sac-fry stage (97%). In contrast, treatment of blue catfish sac-fry with 200 mg DHT/liter, with or without the combination of feeding DHT at 200 mg/kg food, resulted in 100% female populations. Neither clomiphene citrate, an estrogen-receptor blocking agent, nor clofibrate, an inhibitor of hepatic synthesis of cholesterol, affected the sex ratio of channel catfish, and neither of these compounds altered the feminizing effect of 200 mg DHT/kg when fed in combination with DHT. The nonaromatizable androgen DHT is not as effective as many other androgens in producing paradoxical female populations of channel catfish. However, feminization of blue catfish by treatment of sac-fry indicates that this species is more susceptible to hormonal manipulation and that the period of sex determination may occur earlier in development than in channel catfish.

Title:Effects of ethanol and GABAB drugs on working memory in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice.
Authors:['Escher T', 'Mittleman G']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:RATIONALE: It has been suggested that GABA(B) receptors may be part of a neural substrate mediating some of the effects of ethanol. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this experiment was to investigate, in mice, the effects of ethanol on working memory in a delayed matching-to position (DMTP) task, and additionally to determine if these effects were modulated by GABA(B) receptors. METHODS: Female C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice were trained in the DMTP task, and after asymptotic levels of performance accuracy were achieved, injections (IP) of ethanol, baclofen, or phaclofen were administered. Baclofen or phaclofen were then co-administered with ethanol. Each test was repeated twice. RESULTS: Ethanol caused deficits in working memory at 2.0 g/kg and higher. The highest dose (2.5 g/kg) produced additional non-specific effects, indicative of sedation. Baclofen increased performance accuracy (2.5 mg/kg), while decreasing the total number of trials completed. When combined with ethanol (1.5 g/kg), baclofen increased memory deficits at the highest dose (7.5 mg/kg). Phaclofen increased performance accuracy at 10 and 30 mg/kg but had no effect on the total number of trials completed. When combined with ethanol (2.5 g/kg), phaclofen did not significantly alter ethanol-induced deficits in performance. CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of performance accuracy, total trials completed and variables indexing bias and motor impairment indicated that GABA(B) drugs modulate working memory in a behaviorally specific manner. Overall, these receptors may be part of a neural substrate that modulates some of the effects of ethanol.

Title:Speech intelligibility in severe adductor spasmodic dysphonia.

Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN USA. brenda.bender@acu.edu
Abstract:This study compared speech intelligibility in nondisabled speakers and speakers with adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD) before and after botulinum toxin (Botox) injection. Standard speech samples were obtained from 10 speakers diagnosed with severe ADSD prior to and 1 month following Botox injection, as well as from 10 age- and gender-matched healthy adults. This yielded 3 speaking conditions: pre-Botox injection, post-Botox injection, and normal control. Thirty phrases were extracted from the speech samples and arranged in a counterbalanced listening experiment. Thirty students, reporting little experience with distorted speech, served as listeners. Each listener's response was scored for words correctly identified using a liberal scoring criterion yielding a percentage of words correctly identified for each speaker. The results indicated that the speakers with ADSD were significantly more intelligible in the post-Botox condition than in the pre-Botox condition. The results also indicated that healthy speakers were significantly more intelligible than the speakers in both the pre- and post-Botox conditions. In general, these results indicated that intelligibility is affected in severe ADSD and that the use of Botox injection in ADSD improves intelligibility scores. However, the results also indicated that the use of Botox injection does not result in speech intelligibility similar to that of normal, non-ADSD speakers.

Title:Biotic diversity of Natchez Trace State Forest, western Tennessee.

Abstract:We carried out a multiple-scale assessment of biotic resources within Natchez Trace State Forest (NTSF) in western Tennessee, focusing on the relation between biotic communities and seven previously developed ecological land types (ELT, based on topography and soils). We wanted to test the functional ability of ELTs for biodiversity stewardship. Woody and herbaceous flora as well as herpetofauna and avifauna communities had substantial differences between upland and lowland forests. However, none of the faunal communities distinguished among upland ELTs. In addition, herbaceous taxa also failed to distinguish upland ELTs. The results suggest the present use of ELTs at NTSF will not be a helpful guide to land stewardship focusing on biodiversity. The disturbance history of the Forest and the mobility of animals are given as potential explanations for a poor relationship between abiotic ELTs and the resident biota.

Title:The effects of oil spill and clean-up on dominant US Gulf coast marsh macrophytes: a review.
Authors:['Pezeshki SR', 'Hester MW', 'Lin Q', 'Nyman JA']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. srpezshk@memphis.edu
Abstract:The objective of this review was to synthesize existing information regarding the effects of petroleum hydrocarbons on marsh macrophytes in a manner that will help guide research and improve spill-response efficiency. Petroleum hydrocarbons affect plants chemically and physically. Although plants sometime survive fouling by producing new leaves, even relatively non-toxic oils can stress or kill plants if oil physically prevents plant gas-exchange. Plant sensitivity to fouling varies among species and among populations within a species, age of the plant, and season of spill. Physical disturbance and compaction of vegetation and soil associated with clean-up activities following an oil spill appear to have detrimental effects on the US Gulf coast marshes. Other techniques, including the use of chemicals such as cleaners or bioremediation, may be necessary to address the problem. Clean-up may also be beneficial when timely removal prevents oil from migrating to more sensitive habitats.

Title:Effects of acrylamide on germinal vesicle migration and dissolution in oocytes of the frog, Rana pipiens.
Authors:['Lessman CA', 'Kessel RG']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:We have demonstrated that when Rana oocytes are treated with 10 mM acrylamide, germinal vesicle migration (GVM) is promoted while meiosis reinitiation by progesterone is inhibited. A number of other specific alterations result from the acrylamide treatment: (i) A dense band of fibrillar material appears adjacent to the oolemma in acrylamide-treated oocytes. Furthermore, (ii) the fibrillar material reacts with an intermediate filament antibody using immunogold techniques applied to transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, (iii) acrylamide inhibits progestogen-induced annulate lamellae breakdown. In addition, (iv) the cortical mitochondria-rich layer appears to be thickened by acrylamide, which also (v) affects oocyte microvillar retraction and organization. Finally, (vi) electrophysiological measurement of membrane voltage indicates that acrylamide does not significantly affect cell viability during the incubation period used in this study. In summary, acrylamide exerts profound effects on the physiological event of GVM, and these are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in the cytoskeleton are a contributing factor in meiosis reinitiation.

Abstract:Calcium intake often is inadequate in female collegiate athletes, increasing the risk for training injuries and future osteoporosis. Thus, a brief and accurate assessment tool to quickly measure calcium intake in athletes is needed. We evaluated the reliability and validity, compared to 6 days of diet records (DRs), of the Rapid Assessment Method (RAM), a self-administered calcium checklist. Seventy-six female collegiate athletes (mean age = 18.8 yrs, range= 17- 21; 97 % Caucasian) were recruited from basketball, cross-country, field hockey, soccer, and volleyball teams. Athletes completed a RAM at the start of the training season to assess calcium intake during the past week. Two weeks later, a second RAM was completed to assess reliability, and athletes began 6 days of diet records (DRs) collection. At completion of DRs, athletes completed a final RAM, corresponding to the same time period as DRs, to assess agreement between the 2 instruments. The RAM demonstrated adequate test-retest reliability over 2 weeks (n= 56; Intraclass correlation [ICC] = 0.54, p < 0.0001) and adequate agreement with DRs (n = 34; ICC = 0.41, p = 0.0067). Calcium intake was below recommended levels, and mean estimates did not differ significantly on the RAM (823 +/- 387 mg/d) and DRs (822 +/- 330 mg/d; p = 0.988). Adequacy of calcium intake from both DRs and the RAM was classified as "inadequate" (<1000 mg/d) and "adequate" (> or = 1000 mg/d). Agreement between the RAM and DRs for adequacy classification was fair (ICC= 0.30, p = 0.042), with the RAM identifying 84% of athletes judged to have inadequate calcium intake based on DRs. The RAM briefly and accurately estimates calcium intake in female collegiate athletes compared to DRs.

Abstract:One of the most substantial legacies of Herman Feifel was his pioneering research on attitudes toward death and dying in a variety of populations. The authors review the large and multifaceted literature on death anxiety, fear, threat and acceptance, focusing on the attitudes toward death and dying of relevant professional and patient groups, and the relationship of death concern to aging, physical and mental health, religiosity, and terror management strategies. We conclude with several recommendations for improving the conceptual and practical yield of future work in this area.

Abstract:Calcium intake in adolescent and young adult female athletes often is inadequate to optimize peak bone mass, an important determinant of osteoporosis risk. The purpose of this study was to determine if calcium supplementation in eumenorrheic female collegiate athletes increases intake to recommended levels and promotes increases in bone mineral density (BMD). Forty-eight eumenorrheic female athletes from several college teams (15 soccer, 7 cross-country, 8 indoor track, and 18 basketball) were randomized at the beginning of a competitive season to receive either an oral calcium supplement (1000 mg calcium citrate/400 I.U. Vitamin D) or placebo daily throughout the training season (16 weeks). Self-reported daily pill intake was obtained every 2 weeks to assess adherence. Calcium intake was evaluated using the Rapid Assessment Method, and total body and leg BMD was measured at pre-, mid-, and postseason using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA; Hologic QDR-2000). Pre-season calcium intake was lower than national recommendations for this age group (12), averaging 842 mg/d (SD = 719) and was lower in the placebo group compared to the supplemented group (649 +/- 268 vs. 1071 +/- 986 mg/d, respectively; p = .064). Adherence to supplementation was good, averaging 70% across the training season. Supplementation boosted total calcium intake to a mean of 1397 +/- 411 mg/d, which is consistent with recommended levels for this group (37). Supplementation did not influence BMD change during this 16-week intervention. Across teams, a small increase of 0.8% was observed in leg BMD. Change in total body BMD was modified by team, with a significant increase of 1.5% observed in basketball players. These results indicate that providing calcium supplements of 1000 mg/d is adequate to boost total intake to recommended levels during athletic training. Longer intervention trials are required to determine whether calcium supplementation has a positive effect on BMD.

Abstract:Interferons (IFNs) play critical roles in host defense by modulating the expression of various genes via tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT transcription factors. IFN-alpha/beta activates another important transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), but its role in IFN-mediated activity is poorly understood. Sensitivity to the antiviral and gene-inducing effects of IFN was examined in normal fibroblasts and in NF-kappaB knockout fibroblasts from p50- and p65-null mice. Antiviral assays demonstrated that NF-kappaB knockout fibroblasts were sensitized to the antiviral action of IFN. Moreover, analysis of IFN-stimulated gene expression by real-time PCR demonstrated selective effects of NF-kappaB on gene expression. Our results demonstrate that a subset of IFN-stimulated genes is regulated through an NF-kappaB-dependent pathway and that NF-kappaB may regulate the sensitivity of cells to IFN-mediated antiviral activity.

Title:Brain-derived neurotrophic factor reduces TrkB protein and mRNA in the normal retina and following optic nerve crush in adult rats.

Abstract:Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a well-known retinal neuroprotectant, but its effectiveness is limited: higher doses do not yield increased cell survival, multiple applications are not additive, and long-term delivery does not reverse, ganglion cell death. These limitations might reflect either injury- or BDNF-induced retinal changes in TrkB, the high affinity tyrosine kinase receptor used by BDNF. Retinal levels of TrkB protein and mRNA were measured in rats following intravitreal application of BDNF alone, optic nerve crush alone, and both. Full-length receptor protein levels (TrkB.FL) were determined by Western blot analysis and mRNA (trkB.FL) levels were measured using RNAse protection assay (RPA). BDNF alone produced a rapid and prolonged decrease in normal retina TrkB.FL. Nerve crush also resulted in decreased TrkB.FL, but the reduction was not apparent before 2-week post-crush. BDNF applied at the time of the crush yielded reductions in TrkB.FL similar to that of BDNF alone. With respect to TrkB mRNA levels, injection of BDNF into normal eyes and optic nerve crush alone showed bell-shaped patterns of change: approximately 50% below normal at 24-h post-procedure, approximately 50% above normal at 3 days, normal at 7 days, and approximately 50% below normal at 2-week post-procedure. When BDNF and nerve crush were combined, trkB-FL levels reached 90% of normal 1-week post-crush/injection. The data suggest that the limitation of BDNF in promoting ganglion cell survival following optic nerve injury results, in part, due to drug-induced down-regulation of the full-length TrkB receptor needed to activate intracellular pathways.

Title:Disruption of CCTbeta2 expression leads to gonadal dysfunction.
Authors:['Jackowski S', 'Rehg JE', 'Zhang YM', 'Wang J', 'Miller K', 'Jackson P', 'Karim MA']

Abstract:There are two mammalian genes that encode isoforms of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), a key rate-controlling step in membrane phospholipid biogenesis. Quantitative determination of the CCT transcripts reveals that CCTalpha is ubiquitously expressed and is found at the highest levels in the testis and lung, with lower levels in the liver and ovary. CCTbeta2 is a very minor isoform in most tissues but is significantly expressed in the brain, lung, and gonads. CCTbeta3 is the third isoform recently discovered in mice and is expressed in the same tissues as CCTbeta2, with its highest level in testes. We investigated the role(s) of CCTbeta2 by generating knockout mice. The brains and lungs of mice lacking CCTbeta2 expression did not exhibit any overt defects. On the other hand, a large percentage of the CCTbeta2(-/-) females were sterile and their ovaries exhibited defective ovarian follicle development. The proportion of female CCTbeta2(-/-) mice with defective ovaries increased as the animals aged. The rare litters born from CCTbeta2(-/-) x CCTbeta2(-/0) matings had the normal number of pups. The abnormal ovarian histopathology was characterized by disorganization of the tissue in young adult mice and absence of follicles and ova in older mice, along with interstitial stromal cell hyperplasia which culminated in the emergence of tubulostromal ovarian tumors by 16 months of age. Grossly defective CCTbeta2(-/-) ovaries were associated with high follicle-stimulating (FSH) and luteinizing (LH) hormone levels. Male CCTbeta2(-/0) mice exhibited progressive multifocal testicular degeneration and reduced fertility but had normal FSH and LH levels. Thus, the most notable phenotype of CCTbeta2 knockout mice was gonad degeneration and reproductive deficiency. The results indicate that although CCTbeta2 is expressed at very low levels compared to the alpha-isoform, loss of CCTbeta2 expression causes a breakdown in the gonadal response to hormonal stimulation.

Title:Skeletal muscle and hormonal adaptations to circuit weight training in untrained men.
Authors:['Harber MP', 'Fry AC', 'Rubin MR', 'Smith JC', 'Weiss LW']
Affiliation:Human Performance Laboratories, The University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Twelve men either performed 10 weeks of timed circuit weight training 3 days week(-1) (CWT; n=8; X+/-SE; age=23.6+/-1.8 years), or were part of a sedentary control group (n=4; age=20.5+/-1.0 years). Significance was P<0.05 for all analyses. The CWT program significantly increased 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) strength for nine of 10 exercises (15-42%). Although no body composition measure significantly changed for the CWT group, low-to-moderate effect sizes were evident for body weight, lean body mass, and relative fat. CWT did not alter percent fiber type, but did increase cross-sectional areas for type IIA fibers (microm(2); pre=5988+/-323, post=7259+/-669). Relative (%) myosin heavy-chain (MHC) expression increased for MHC IIa (pre=42.5+/-2.7, post=50.1+/-2.6), and decreased for MHC IIb (pre=21.8+/-2.8, post=15.4+/-2.4) for the CWT group. Serum testosterone, cortisol, and the testosterone/cortisol ratio did not change at any time for the CWT group. None of the measured variables changed for the control group. These data indicate that for untrained subjects, CWT of the type used resulted in improved muscular strength and a tendency toward increased lean mass. Compared with other types of weight training, fewer adaptations of the muscle fibers were evident. This is likely due in part to the relatively low loads used with this type of resistance exercise.

Title:A psychological model that integrates ethics in engineering education.
Authors:['Magun-Jackson S']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. smgnjcks@memphis.edu
Abstract:Ethics has become an increasingly important issue within engineering as the profession has become progressively more complex. The need to integrate ethics into an engineering curriculum is well documented, as education does not often sufficiently prepare engineers for the ethical conflicts they experience. Recent research indicates that there is great diversity in the way institutions approach the problem of teaching ethics to undergraduate engineering students; some schools require students to take general ethics courses from philosophical or religious perspectives, while others integrate ethics in existing engineering courses. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method to implement the integration of ethics in engineering education that is pedagogically based on Kohlberg's stage theory of moral development.

Title:Influences of the temporal nature of the applied load and the tibial baseplate material on the stress distribution in a three-dimensional model of the human knee joint containing a prosthetic replacement.
Authors:['Nambu SN', 'Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of mechanical Engineering, The university of Memphis, TN 38152-3180, USA.
Abstract:The finite element analysis method was used to determine the stresses in all sections of a three-dimensional model of the proximal section of the human knee joint into which was cemented two parts of a total knee joint replacement (the tibial tray and the tibial baseplate), fully constrained at its distal end, and subjected to a total compressive joint force of 2 kN acting on points corresponding to the condyles. When the mean values of these stresses were computed for all sections of the model, two important trends were seen. First, when the load was applied dynamically, the stresses were between 1 and 20% different than when it acted quasi-statically. Second, regardless of how the load was applied, the stresses when the tibial baseplate was considered fabricated from ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene ranged from about 40% lower to about 320% higher compared to when Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy was used. The significance of these findings as well as the limitations of the study are discussed.

Abstract:Swallowing impairment with advancing age is a major health care problem, especially among nursing home residents. An estimated 40% to 60% of nursing home residents have signs of swallowing disorders or dysphagia. The high number of nursing home residents with dysphagia is, at least in part, caused by patients with swallowing disorders being more likely to be discharged to institutional care. Aging alone does not result in swallowing disorders. Conditions that contribute to swallowing problems include dementia, cerebral vascular accidents, Parkinson's disease, neuromuscular disorders, and some medications. This article discusses the health-related rationale for thickened liquids and fluid viscosities, reviews each phase of the study, and concludes with the practical implications of the study for clinical dietitians.

Title:Anaerobic exercise and oxidative stress: a review.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ', 'Goldfarb AH']
Affiliation:Department of Sport and Exercise Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Oxidative stress and subsequent damage to cellular proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, as well as changes to the glutathione system, are well documented in response to aerobic exercise. However, far less information is available on anaerobic exercise-induced oxidative modifications. Recent evidence indicates that high intensity anaerobic work does result in oxidative modification to the above-mentioned macromolecules in both skeletal muscle and blood. Also, it appears that chronic anaerobic exercise training can induce adaptations that act to attenuate the exercise-induced oxidative stress. These may be specific to increased antioxidant defenses and/or may act to reduce the generation of pro-oxidants during and after exercise. However, a wide variety of exercise protocols and assay procedures have been used to study oxidative stress pertaining to anaerobic work. Therefore, precise conclusions about the exact extent and location of oxidative macromolecule damage, in addition to the adaptations resulting from chronic anaerobic exercise training, are difficult to indicate. This manuscript provides a review of anaerobic exercise and oxidative stress, presenting both the acute effects of a single exercise bout and the potential for adaptations resulting from chronic anaerobic training.

Title:Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vectors as oncolytic agents in the treatment of high-grade gliomas in an organotypic brain tissue slice-glioma coculture model.

Abstract:OBJECT: The purpose of this study was to evaluate both replication-competent and replication-restricted recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors as therapeutic agents for high-grade gliomas by using an organotypic brain tissue slice-glioma coculture system. METHODS: The coculture system involved growing different brain structures together to allow neurons from these tissues to develop synaptic connections similar to those found in vivo. Rat C6 or human U87 glioma cells were then introduced into the culture to evaluate VSV as an oncolytic therapy. The authors found that recombinant wild-type VSV (rVSV-wt) rapidly eliminated C6 glioma cells from the coculture, but also caused significant damage to neurons, as measured by a loss of microtubule-associated protein 2 immunoreactivity and a failure in electrophysiological responses from neurons in the tissue slice. Nonetheless, pretreatment with interferon beta (IFNbeta) virtually eliminated VSV infection in healthy tissues without impeding any oncolytic effects on tumor cells. Despite the protective effects of the IFNbeta pretreatment, the tissue slices still showed signs of cytopathology when exposed to rVSV-wt. In contrast, pretreatment with IFNbeta and inoculation with a replication-restricted vector with its glycoprotein gene deleted (rVSV-deltaG) effectively destroyed rat C6 and human U87 glioma cells in the coculture, without causing detectable damage to the neuronal integrity and electrophysiological properties of the healthy tissue in the culture. CONCLUSIONS: Data in this study provide in vitro proof-of-principle that rVSV-deltaG is an effective oncolytic agent that has minimal toxic side effects to neurons compared with rVSV-wt and therefore should be considered for development as an adjuvant to surgery in the treatment of glioma.

Title:Antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus-1 in vitro by myristoylated-peptide from Heliothis virescens.
Authors:['Ourth DD']
Affiliation:Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-3560, USA. ddourth@memphis.edu
Abstract:An insect antiviral compound was purified from Heliothis virescens larval hemolymph by gel-filtration high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and C-18 reverse-phase HPLC and its structure was determined by mass spectrometry. The antiviral compound is an N-myristoylated-peptide containing six amino acids with calculated molecular weight of 916 Da. The N-terminus contains the fatty acid myristoyl, and the C-terminus contains histidine with two methyl groups giving the histidine a permanent positive charge. The remainder of the compound is essentially non-polar. The structure of the compound corresponds with the 'myristate plus basic' motif expressed by certain viral proteins in their binding to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane to initiate viral assembly and budding from a host cell. The insect antiviral compound may inhibit viral assembly and/or budding of viruses from host cells that could include the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and herpes simplex virus-1 that use this motif for exit from a host cell. Using the formazan assay, the myristoylated-peptide was effective against HIV-1, with a nine times increase in the viability and protection in vitro of treated CEM-SS cells when compared with infected but untreated control cells.

Title:Effect of lithotriptor treatment on the fracture toughness of acrylic bone cement.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) has now been established as an efficacious non-invasive modality for the management of renal calculi and has shown promise for management of other types of stone, as well. Following on from these successes, ESWL has recently been proposed for use in the preliminary stages of revision of cemented total hip joint replacements as a means of breaking up the cement mantle. It is useful, therefore, to examine the effect of shock waves on pertinent mechanical properties of the cement. This study utilizes the chevron-notch short-rod specimen and a commercially available test system to obtain the values of one such property, namely fracture toughness, of Palacos Radiopaque bone cement before and after treatment with shock waves delivered from a lithotriptor. The fracture toughness drops by about 14% following the shock wave treatment, thus confirming the possibility that ESWL can be used, as indicated earlier, in revision arthroplasty.

Title:Chytridiomycosis impacts predator-prey interactions in larval amphibian communities.
Authors:['Parris MJ', 'Beaudoin JG']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. mparris@memphis.edu
Abstract:Despite ecologists increasingly recognizing pathogens as playing significant roles in community dynamics, few experimental studies have quantified patterns of disease impacts on natural systems. Amphibians are experiencing population declines, and a fungal pathogen ( Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Chytridiomycota) is a suspected causal agent in many declines. We studied the effects of a pathogenic fungus on community interactions between the gray treefrog, Hyla chrysoscelis, and eastern newts, Notophthalmus viridescens. Recent studies have characterized chytridiomycosis as an emerging infectious disease, whose suspected rapid range expansion and widespread occurrence pose a significant risk for amphibian populations worldwide. We reared larvae in outdoor polyethylene experimental tanks and tested the effects of initial larval density, predator presence, and fungal exposure on Hyla recruitment and predator-prey interactions between Hyla and Notophthalmus. Newts reduced treefrog survival, and high intraspecific density decreased metamorphic body mass independent of B. dendrobatidis. The presence of fungi reduced treefrog body mass at metamorphosis by 34%, but had no significant main effect on survival or larval period length. B. dendrobatidis differentially affected larval development in the presence of predators; Hyla developed slower when reared with the pathogen, but only when newts were present. This significant predator-by-pathogen interaction suggests that the impact of chytridiomycosis on larval amphibians may be exacerbated in complex communities. Our data suggest that B. dendrobatidis effects on host life history may be complex and indirect. Direct measurements of the community-level effects of pathogens offer an important opportunity to understand a significant threat to global biodiversity-declining amphibian populations.

Abstract:Islet transplantation is limited by islet graft failure due to poor revascularization, host immune rejection and nonspecific inflammatory response. Delivery of human vascular endothelial growth factor (hVEGF) gene to the islets is likely to promote islet revascularization and survival. We used a bicistronic adenoviral vector encoding hVEGF and CpG-free allele of green fluorescent protein (Adv-GFP-hVEGF) and introduced into human pancreatic islets by transfection. We found that transfection efficiency and apoptosis were dependent on the multiplicity of infection (MOI). Compared to Adv-GFP transfected and nontransfected islets, the levels of hVEGF secreted from Adv-GFP-hVEGF transfected islets were higher and exhibit a linear relationship between hVEGF expression and MOI (10-5000). Persistent, but low level expression of hVEGF from nontransfected islets was also observed. This may be due to expression of the endogenous hVEGF gene under hypoxic conditions. The levels of DNA fragmentation determined by ELISA of islet lysates were dependent on the MOI of Adv-GFP-hVEGF. On glucose challenge, insulin release from transfected islets was comparable to nontransfected islets. Immunohistochemical staining for hVEGF was very high in Adv-GFP-hVEGF transfected islets. Weak staining was also observed for hCD31 in both transfected and nontransfected islets. These findings suggest that Adv-GFP-hVEGF is a potential candidate for promoting islet revascularization.

Title:Biomechanics of and research challenges in uncemented total ankle replacement.
Authors:['Lewis G']

Abstract:Only limited data are available currently on the clinical performance of uncemented total ankle replacements. Even so, various complications, notably loosening and/or migration of the talar and/or tibial components, already have been seen. Nonetheless, the current consensus is that, in all likelihood, uncemented total ankle prostheses will continue to be implanted in some patients. Therefore, it is important that future designers of this prosthesis be conversant with all the requirements that a design must fulfill, be aware of the various features of second-generation designs that were introduced to address problems seen in implanted cemented first-generation replacement designs, be knowledgeable about the in vivo performance, to date, of uncemented second-generation total ankle replacement designs and how features of a design may impact its performance, and be cognizant of the gaps and/or controversies in the literature and the extent to which they could be addressed through focused research. All of these four aspects, which have been treated inadequately in the literature, are treated in detail in the current review, with the hope that the review will serve as a primer for those involved in designing the next generation of uncemented total ankle replacements. Thirteen design requirements, including kinematics, kinetics, and stability aspects, are described. Various features of three second-generation designs are described. For three second-generation designs, the relationship between their estimated in vivo performance and the extent of joint resurfacing needed to implant them is presented. Among the seven future research areas discussed are design, fabrication, and validation of an ankle simulator, and development of a set of standardized biomechanical tests.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Compare the effect of a daily dose of sodium thiosulfate (STS) to continuous infusion of STS on Hartley albino guinea pig (HAGP) on cisplatin (CP)-induced sensorineural hearing loss. Study design Prospective randomized pilot study comparing a single daily dose of STS to a constant controlled infusion of STS given the middle ear space (MES) with an ototoxic regimen of CP. The hearing thresholds will be obtained by auditory brainstem response (ABR) 1 week before and after treatment. Treatment effects on responses at 2, 8, and 16 kHz signals will be investigated by an analysis of variance with one between subjects' condition and two within subjects' conditions. SETTING: Basic science laboratory. RESULTS: STS protection resulted in significantly less hearing loss post-treatment for the protected ears. Guinea pigs with continuous infusion of STS demonstrated less loss in the protected ear than those who received the single daily dose. As expected, hearing loss at 2 kHz was less than that at 8 and 16 kHz. CONCLUSION: A continuous infusion of STS directly to the MES is better than a single daily dose of STS to the MES in reducing the ototoxicity of CP. SIGNIFICANCE: Any targeted protection, whether by continuous infusion or daily dose, is better than no protection against the sensorineural hearing loss of CP.

Title:A Monte Carlo study of fluctuating polymer-grafted membranes.
Authors:['Laradji M']

Abstract:Using Monte Carlo simulations of an off-lattice model, we study the elastic properties of polymer-grafted membranes. Our results are found to be in good agreement with those predicted by the classical path approximation of the self-consistent field theory and scaling theory based on de Gennes' blob picture. In particular, we found that when the membrane is grafted on both sides by brushes with same molecular weight N and grafting density sigma, the excess bending modulus induced by the polymers scales as N3 sigmaalpha where alpha is consistent with 7/3, as predicted by the self-consistent field theory, and 5/2, as predicted by the scaling theory. When the polymers are grafted to one side of the membrane only, the membrane bends away from the polymers with a spontaneous curvature with a scaling that is consistent with both scaling and self-consistent field theories. When the thickness of the brush exceeds the membrane's spontaneous radius of curvature, the bending modulus approaches a constant which is of the same order as the bending modulus of the bare membrane.

Abstract:The dynamics of phase separation in a simple binary mixture containing mobile filler particles that are preferentially wet by one of the two components is investigated systematically via Langevin simulations in two dimensions. We found that while the filler particles reduce the growth rate of spinodal decomposition, the domain growth remains essentially identical to that of the pure binary mixture. The growth rate diminishes as either the filler particles concentration is increased or their diffusivity is decreased.

Abstract:Migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells are key events in injury-induced neointima formation. Several growth factors and ANG II are thought to be involved in neointima formation. A recent report indicated that vascular injury is associated with increased mRNA levels of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)-1B (PTP-1B). In the present study, we tested the following hypotheses: 1) rat carotid artery injury induces the expression of PTP-1B, Src homology-2 domain phosphatase (SHP-2), and PTP-proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine sequence (PEST) protein; and 2) polypeptide growth factors as well as ANG II increase the levels of tyrosine phosphatases in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. We found that vascular injury induced by balloon catheter increases the protein levels of aforementioned phosphatases and that these effects occur in a PTP specific, as well as temporally and regionally specific, manner. Moreover, treatment of cultured primary rat aortic smooth muscle cells with PDGF or bFGF, but not with IGF1, EGF, or ANG II, increases PTP-1B, SHP-2, and PTP-PEST protein levels. These results suggest that increased PDGF and bFGF levels, occurring after vascular injury, may induce expression of several PTPs.

Abstract:Gene activators contain activation domains that are thought to recruit limiting components of the transcription machinery to a core promoter. VP16, a viral gene activator, has served as a model for studying the mechanistic aspects of transcriptional activation from yeast to human. The VP16 activation domain can be divided into two modules--an N-terminal subdomain (VPN) and a C-terminal subdomain (VPC). This study demonstrates that VPC stimulates core promoters that are either independent or dependent on TAFs (TATA-box Binding Protein-Associated Factors). In contrast, VPN only activates the TAF-independent core promoter and this activity increases in a synergistic fashion when VPN is dimerized (VPN2). Compared to one copy of VPN (VPN1), VPN2 also displays a highly cooperative increase in binding hTFIIB. The increased TFIIB binding correlates with VPN2's increased ability to recruit a complex containing TFIID, TFIIA and TFIIB. However, VPN1 and VPN2 do not increase the assembly of a complex containing only TFIID and TFIIA. The VPN subdomain also facilitates assembly of a complex containing TBP:TFIIA:TFIIB, which lacks TAFs, and provides a mechanism that could function at TAF-independent promoters. Taken together, these results suggest the interaction between VPN and TFIIB potentially initiate a network of contacts allowing the activator to indirectly tether TFIID or TBP to DNA.

Title:Confinement free energy and chain conformations of homopolymers confined between two repulsive walls.
Authors:['Wang Y']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-3550, USA.
Abstract:Lattice Monte Carlo simulations of polymer solutions confined between two parallel plates were performed. The confinement free energy Deltamicro(conf) per chain and the radius of gyrations of the chains parallel and perpendicular to the plates were obtained. When the concentration of the confined solution is above the overlap concentration, Deltamicro(conf) is found to scale with Na/D in a power law, betaDeltamicro(conf) approximately (Na/D)(m), with an exponent m=1.10+/-0.02 for athermal walls where N is the number of monomers in a chain, D is the slit width, and a is the lattice spacing. The presence of a weak attractive polymer/wall interaction epsilon(w) does not change the scaling variable, but the exponent m increases slightly. Extrapolating the results to melt would suggest that the predictions made by de Gennes [C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris II 305, 1181 (1987)] about the confinement free energy cost per chain in polymer melt is correct as far as the scaling variable is concerned, but is incorrect about the exponent m observed. The implication of this result on the predicted force between plates immersed in polymer melt is discussed. The parallel dimensions of the confined chain is expanded when the slit width D is narrow, however, the expansion is reduced at high concentration. It is conceivable that in melt the chain is not expanded when confined in a repulsive slit.

Title:Thermodynamics and partitioning of homopolymers into a slit-A grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation study.
Authors:['Jiang W', 'Wang Y']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-3550.
Abstract:Grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo simulation (GCMC) combined with the histogram reweighting technique was used to study the thermodynamic equilibrium of a homopolymer solution between a bulk and a slit pore. GCMC gives the partition coefficients that agree with those from canonical ensemble Monte Carlo simulations in a twin box, and it also gives results that are not accessible through the regular canonical ensemble simulation such as the osmotic pressure of the solution. In a bulk polymer solution, the calculated osmotic pressure agrees very well with the scaling theory predictions both for the athermal polymer solution and the theta solution. However, one cannot obtain the osmotic pressure of the confined solution in the same way since the osmotic pressure of the confined solution is anisotropic. The chemical potentials in GCMC simulations were found to differ by a translational term from the chemical potentials obtained from canonical ensemble Monte Carlo simulations with the chain insertion method. This confirms the equilibrium condition of a polymer solution partition between the bulk and a slit pore: the chemical potentials of the polymer chain including the translational term are equal at equilibrium. The histogram reweighting method enables us to obtain the partition coefficients in the whole range of concentrations based on a limited set of simulations. Those predicted bulk-pore partition coefficient data enable us to perform further theoretical analysis. Scaling predictions of the partition coefficient at different regimes were given and were confirmed by the simulation data.

Abstract:MOTIVATION: A major challenge in the interpretation of high-throughput genomic data is understanding the functional associations between genes. Previously, several approaches have been described to extract gene relationships from various biological databases using term-matching methods. However, more flexible automated methods are needed to identify functional relationships (both explicit and implicit) between genes from the biomedical literature. In this study, we explored the utility of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), a vector space model for information retrieval, to automatically identify conceptual gene relationships from titles and abstracts in MEDLINE citations. RESULTS: We found that LSI identified gene-to-gene and keyword-to-gene relationships with high average precision. In addition, LSI identified implicit gene relationships based on word usage patterns in the gene abstract documents. Finally, we demonstrate here that pairwise distances derived from the vector angles of gene abstract documents can be effectively used to functionally group genes by hierarchical clustering. Our results provide proof-of-principle that LSI is a robust automated method to elucidate both known (explicit) and unknown (implicit) gene relationships from the biomedical literature. These features make LSI particularly useful for the analysis of novel associations discovered in genomic experiments. AVAILABILITY: The 50-gene document collection used in this study can be interactively queried at http://shad.cs.utk.edu/sgo/sgo.html.

Title:Proteome analysis in the bovine adrenal medulla using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.
Authors:['Jalili PR', 'Dass C']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS)-based proteomics has been used to identify soluble proteins in the bovine adrenal medulla. This gland is a major source of hormones, opioids, neurotransmitters, and several vital proteins. The adrenal medulla proteins were first purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation. The resulting proteins were then pre-fractionated with a C-4 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column. Each 2-min HPLC fraction was digested with trypsin, and separated further and analyzed using capillary liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (capLC/nanospray-MS/MS) to map the proteome of the adrenal medulla. The parent mass and sequence ion information thus obtained for tryptic peptides was used to search the NCBInr database using the SEQUEST search engine. A total of 195 proteins were identified, of which 71 had good scores (delta correlation value greater than 0.1, preliminary score above 200, and cross-correlation value above 2.5). The prominent proteins thus identified are secretogranin I precursor, chromogranin A, proenkephalin A precursor, myosin X, hemoglobin beta chain, hemoglobin alpha chain, heat shock protein 10 kDa, and replicase.

Abstract:Temporal and spatial regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is vital for cell migration. Here, we show that an epithelial cell actin-binding protein, villin, plays a crucial role in this process. Overexpression of villin in doxycyline-regulated HeLa cells enhanced cell migration. Villin-induced cell migration was modestly augmented by growth factors. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of villin and villin-induced cell migration was significantly inhibited by the src kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) as well as by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of c-src. These data suggest that phosphorylation of villin by c-src is involved in the actin cytoskeleton remodeling necessary for cell migration. We have previously shown that villin is tyrosine phosphorylated at four major sites. To further investigate the role of tyrosine phosphorylated villin in cell migration, we used phosphorylation site mutants (tyrosine to phenylalanine or tyrosine to glutamic acid) in HeLa cells. We determined that tyrosine phosphorylation at residues 60, 81, and 256 of human villin played an essential role in cell migration as well as in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Collectively, these studies define how biophysical events such as cell migration are actuated by biochemical signaling pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation of actin binding proteins, in this case villin.

Title:Adhesion of microvascular endothelial cells to metallic implant surfaces.

Abstract:The objective of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of adhesion of endothelial cells (ECs) to implant grades of titanium alloy (Ti) and stainless steel (SS), compared to tissue culture polystyrene (PS). The idea is that promotion of EC adhesion to implant surfaces during the initial stages of healing may be critical in the formation of a capillary bed intimately associated with the implant surface. Ultimately this could be expected in turn to promote bone formation close to the surface and a more stable implant/bone interface. Surfaces were coated with either peak 1 fibrinogen gammaAgammaA, fibrinogen Fr I-9, fibrinogen fragment D1, fibronectin, vitronectin, or fetal calf serum and then post-coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to block non-specific cell adhesion. Surfaces with BSA alone and no other protein coating were also evaluated. Fibronectin coating maximized cell adhesion on all three surfaces, and adhesion was highest on PS. BSA blocked cell adhesion to PS (and most adhesion to SS) much better than to Ti. These results provide evidence that BSA adsorption on the metal surface is unable to effectively block the adhesion of the cells to the Ti. These data may provide a basis for understanding in vivo observations that soft tissue becomes attached to a Ti surface more rapidly and with more bone formation than to SS. Evidence is also presented that alphavbeta3 plays an important role in adhesion of ECs to the Ti surface. These experiments also provide preliminary data which may reflect some of the features of initial EC adhesion to metal implants.

Abstract:Infrared and Raman spectra of vinyltriethoxysilane (VTES), the VTES sol-gel, and the sol-gel coated aluminum have been collected. The assignments of the vibrational modes for the silane, the sol-gel, and the sol-gel films have been made based on the group frequencies and the spectral variation collected at different physical and chemical states of the sol-gel samples. Applying the sol-gels onto the metal grids allowed the drying and the high temperature treatment of the samples for the collection of infrared transmission spectra. From the variation of the sol-gel and the sol-gel coated aluminum IR spectra with temperature, it was noticed that the samples partially decomposed when the temperature was higher than 100 degrees C. Electrochemical experiments have demonstrated that the anticorrosion property of the coated aluminum has significantly increased. The water and the hexadecane contact angle measurements showed that the surface modified metal had a much higher hydrophobic property than the untreated metal.

Abstract:Mannose-binding C-type lectin (MBL) is an important component of innate immunity in mammals. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), an acute phase protein, acts as an opsonin for phagocytosis and also activates the mannan-binding lectin complement pathway. It may play a particularly significant role during infancy before adequate specific protection can be provided by the adaptive immune system. Ureaplasma urealyticum has been linked to several diseases including pneumonia and chronic lung disease (CLD) in premature infants. We therefore investigated the ability of U. urealyticum to bind MBL. A guinea pig IgG anti-rabbit-MBL antiserum was produced. An immunoblot (dot-blot) assay done on nitrocellulose membrane determined that the anti-MBL antibody had specificity against both rabbit and human MBL. Pure cultures of U. urealyticum, serotype 3, were used to make slide preparations. The slides containing the organisms were then incubated with nonimmune rabbit serum containing MBL. Ureaplasma was shown to bind rabbit MBL with an immunocytochemical assay using the guinea pig IgG anti-rabbit MBL antiserum. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-guinea pig IgG was used to localize the reaction. The anti-MBL antiserum was also used in an immunocytochemical assay to localize U. urealyticum in histological sections of lungs from mice specifically infected with this organism. The same method also indicated binding of MBL by ureaplasma in human lung tissue obtained at autopsy from culture positive infants. Our results demonstrate that ureaplasma has the capacity to bind MBL. The absence of MBL may play a role in the predisposition of diseases related to this organism.

Abstract:AutoTutor is a learning environment that tutors students by holding a conversation in natural language. AutoTutor has been developed for Newtonian qualitative physics and computer literacy. Its design was inspired by explanation-based constructivist theories of learning, intelligent tutoring systems that adaptively respond to student knowledge, and empirical research on dialogue patterns in tutorial discourse. AutoTutor presents challenging problems (formulated as questions) from a curriculum script and then engages in mixed initiative dialogue that guides the student in building an answer. It provides the student with positive, neutral, or negative feedback on the student's typed responses, pumps the student for more information, prompts the student to fill in missing words, gives hints, fills in missing information with assertions, identifies and corrects erroneous ideas, answers the student's questions, and summarizes answers. AutoTutor has produced learning gains of approximately .70 sigma for deep levels of comprehension.

Abstract:Advances in computational linguistics and discourse processing have made it possible to automate many language- and text-processing mechanisms. We have developed a computer tool called Coh-Metrix, which analyzes texts on over 200 measures of cohesion, language, and readability. Its modules use lexicons, part-of-speech classifiers, syntactic parsers, templates, corpora, latent semantic analysis, and other components that are widely used in computational linguistics. After the user enters an English text, CohMetrix returns measures requested by the user. In addition, a facility allows the user to store the results of these analyses in data files (such as Text, Excel, and SPSS). Standard text readability formulas scale texts on difficulty by relying on word length and sentence length, whereas Coh-Metrix is sensitive to cohesion relations, world knowledge, and language and discourse characteristics.

Abstract:Interactive Strategy Training for Active Reading and Thinking (iSTART) is a Web-based application that provides young adolescent to college-age students with high-level reading strategy training to improve comprehension of science texts. iSTART is modeled after an effective, human-delivered intervention called self-explanation reading training (SERT), which trains readers to use active reading strategies to self-explain difficult texts more effectively. To make the training more widely available, the Web-based trainer has been developed. Transforming the training from a human-delivered application to a computer-based one has resulted in a highly interactive trainer that adapts its methods to the performance of the students. The iSTART trainer introduces the strategies in a simulated classroom setting with interaction between three animated characters-an instructor character and two student characters-and the human trainee. Thereafter, the trainee identifies the strategies in the explanations of a student character who is guided by an instructor character. Finally, the trainee practices self-explanation under the guidance of an instructor character. We describe this system and discuss how appropriate feedback is generated.

Title:The in vitro elution of gentamicin sulfate from a commercially available gentamicin-loaded acrylic bone cement, VersaBond AB.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Janna S']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:The present study was designed to yield results that would be used to contribute to the ongoing debate about the mechanism of the in vitro elution of an antibiotic from an antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement. To this end, the elution rates (R) of gentamicin sulfate (expressed as a weight percentage of the initial mass of the antibiotic in the specimen, normalized with respect to the duration of the test) from statically loaded (STATIC) and dynamically loaded (+/-10 MPa; 2 Hz; until fracture; DYNAMIC) specimens fabricated from a commercially available acrylic bone cement (VersaBond AB), in phosphate-buffered saline solution at 37 degrees C, were obtained with the use of a spectrophotometric method. There was evidence of microcracking in the fracture surfaces of DYNAMIC specimens, but no such evidence in the case of STATIC specimens. The surface area of the DYNAMIC specimens, during the tensile phase of the cyclical loading, was estimated to be about 3% larger than for the STATIC specimens (1742 mm(2) versus 1696 mm(2)). The bulk porosities P of the specimens in both sets were also determined and found to not be statistically different, with P for the STATIC and DYNAMIC specimens being 8.55 +/- 0.10 and 8.88 +/- 0.18%, respectively. At the end of the test period, R was found to be 0.36 +/- 0.20 and 1.28 +/- 0.14 wt %/day for the STATIC and DYNAMIC specimens, respectively. It is suggested that the present results provide support for the postulate that the elution mechanism of gentamicin in this cement is a surface phenomenon.

Title:Male mammals respond to a risk of sperm competition conveyed by odours of conspecific males.

Abstract:Sperm competition occurs when a female copulates with two or more males and the sperm of those males compete within the female's reproductive tract to fertilize her eggs. The frequent occurrence of sperm competition has forced males of many species to develop different strategies to overcome the sperm of competing males. A prevalent strategy is for males to increase their sperm investment (total number of sperm allocated by a male to a particular female) after detecting a risk of sperm competition. It has been shown that the proportion of sperm that one male contributes to the sperm pool of a female is correlated with the proportion of offspring sired by that male. Therefore, by increasing his sperm investment a male may bias a potential sperm competition in his favour. Here we show that male meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, increase their sperm investment when they mate in the presence of another male's odours. Such an increase in sperm investment does not occur by augmenting the frequency of ejaculations, but by increasing the amount of sperm in a similar number of ejaculations.

Abstract:The motions of large systems such as the ribosome are not fully accessible with conventional molecular simulations. A coarse-grained, less-than-atomic-detail model such as the anisotropic network model (ANM) is a convenient informative tool to study the cooperative motions of the ribosome. The motions of the small 30S subunit, the larger 50S subunit, and the entire 70S assembly of the two subunits have been analyzed using ANM. The lowest frequency collective modes predicted by ANM show that the 50S subunit and 30S subunit are strongly anti-correlated in the motion of the 70S assembly. A ratchet-like motion is observed that corresponds well to the experimentally reported ratchet motion. Other slow modes are also examined because of their potential links to the translocation steps in the ribosome. We identify several modes that may facilitate the E-tRNA exiting from the assembly. The A-site t-RNA and P-site t-RNA are found to be strongly coupled and positively correlated in these slow modes, suggesting that the translocations of these two t-RNAs occur simultaneously, while the motions of the E-site t-RNA are less correlated, and thus less likely to occur simultaneously. Overall the t-RNAs exhibit relatively large deformations. Animations of these slow modes of motion can be viewed at.

Abstract:In an effort to develop new and more potent therapies to treat tuberculosis, a library of compounds was screened for M. tuberculosis UDP-Gal mutase inhibition. Nitrofuranylamide 1 was identified as a hit in this screen, possessing good antituberculosis activity. This paper describes the synthesis and evaluation of an expanded set of nitrofuranylamides. We have discovered a number of nitrofuranylamides with submicromolar M. tuberculosis MIC values and acceptable therapeutic indexes. The MIC activity did not correlate with UDP-Gal mutase inhibition, suggesting an alternative primary cellular target was responsible for the antituberculosis activity. The compounds were only active against mycobacteria of the tuberculosis complex. On the basis of these results, four compounds were selected for in vivo testing in a mouse model of tuberculosis infection, and of these compounds one showed significant antituberculosis activity.

Abstract:The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of antioxidant therapy on indirect markers of muscle damage following eccentric exercise (EE). Eighteen women were randomized to an antioxidant supplement or a placebo before a bout of EE. Plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, muscle soreness (MS), maximal isometric force (MIF), and range of motion (ROM) were assessed before and through 14 d postexercise. Eccentric exercise resulted in an increase in CK activity and MS, and a drop in MIF and ROM during the days following EE, which returned to baseline values 14 d after EE in both groups. Antioxidants attenuated the CK activity and MS response to the EE, while little difference was noted between groups in MIF or ROM. These findings suggest that antioxidant supplementation was helpful in reducing the elevations in plasma CK activity and MS, with little impact on MIF and ROM loss.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: The integration of the rapidly expanding corpus of information about the genome, transcriptome, and proteome, engendered by powerful technological advances, such as microarrays, and the availability of genomic sequence from multiple species, challenges the grasp and comprehension of the scientific community. Despite the existence of text-mining methods that identify biological relationships based on the textual co-occurrence of gene/protein terms or similarities in abstract texts, knowledge of the underlying molecular connections on a large scale, which is prerequisite to understanding novel biological processes, lags far behind the accumulation of data. While computationally efficient, the co-occurrence-based approaches fail to characterize (e.g., inhibition or stimulation, directionality) biological interactions. Programs with natural language processing (NLP) capability have been created to address these limitations, however, they are in general not readily accessible to the public. RESULTS: We present a NLP-based text-mining approach, Chilibot, which constructs content-rich relationship networks among biological concepts, genes, proteins, or drugs. Amongst its features, suggestions for new hypotheses can be generated. Lastly, we provide evidence that the connectivity of molecular networks extracted from the biological literature follows the power-law distribution, indicating scale-free topologies consistent with the results of previous experimental analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Chilibot distills scientific relationships from knowledge available throughout a wide range of biological domains and presents these in a content-rich graphical format, thus integrating general biomedical knowledge with the specialized knowledge and interests of the user. Chilibot http://www.chilibot.net can be accessed free of charge to academic users.

Abstract:The present work proposed a methodology to monitor cement microcrack formation in the cemented femoral stem construct using the acoustic emission technique. This technique provides a unique means to automatically tally the number of microcracks, to visualize microcrack distribution, and to animate the progress of crack formation in a given time window of a fatigue test. In this work, the formulation of microcrack source location was derived and a computer program was developed specifically for the proposed application. The program was validated using computer simulation and standard pencil lead break tests. It was found that the mathematical errors complied with the acceptable minimal error. Based on the pencil lead break tests, the average technical error used to estimate the resolution of this technique was 4.7 mm at the present stage. The program was then used to monitor the fatigue damage in precoated cemented femoral hip constructs loaded for a total of more than five million cycles. Two types of microcrack activities were observed in the experiments: Type I and Type II microcracks. A Type I microcrack was a crack that was captured by four or more sensors, and therefore its location was defined uniquely by a set of coordinates. A Type II microcrack was a crack that was captured by three or less sensors, therefore it was unlocatable. Both counts of Type I and Type II microcrack were tallied with respect to the day of fatigue tests. Acoustic emission microcrack graphs were used to visualize the distribution of Type I microcracks in the construct. It was found that the Type I microcracks distributed mainly over the proximal third of the stem. The amount of microcrack events decreased significantly as the number of loading cycles increased.

Title:Leukocyte-derived myeloperoxidase amplifies high-glucose--induced endothelial dysfunction through interaction with high-glucose--stimulated, vascular non--leukocyte-derived reactive oxygen species.

Abstract:Vascular non-leukocyte-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), have emerged as important molecules in diabetic endothelial dysfunction. In addition, leukocyte-derived myeloperoxidase (MPO) has been implicated in vascular injury, and its injury response is H(2)O(2) dependent. It is well known that MPO can use leukocyte-derived H(2)O(2); however, it is unknown whether the vascular-bound MPO can use high-glucose-stimulated, vascular non-leukocyte-derived H(2)O(2) to induce diabetic endothelial dysfunction. In the present study, we demonstrated that MPO activity is increased in vessels from diabetic rats. In high-glucose-incubated rat aortas and in carotid arteries from rats with acute hyperglycemia, vascular-bound MPO utilized high-glucose-stimulated H(2)O(2) to amplify the ROS-induced impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation via reduction of nitric oxide bioavailability. Hypochlorous acid (HOCL)-modified LDL, a specific biomarker for the MPO/HOCL/chlorinating species pathway, was detected in LDL- and MPO-bound vessels with high-glucose-stimulated H(2)O(2). The results suggest that vascular-bound MPO could use high-glucose-stimulated H(2)O(2) to amplify high-glucose-induced injury in the vascular wall. MPO/H(2)O(2)/HOCL/chlorinating species may represent an important pathway in diabetes complications and a new mechanism in phagocyte- and systemic infection-induced exacerbation of diabetic vascular diseases.

Title:The thalamic intergeniculate leaflet modulates photoperiod responsiveness in Siberian hamsters.

Abstract:Siberian hamsters are seasonal breeders that use changes in day length to synchronize their reproductive effort with those times of the year most favorable for successful reproduction. The ability of Siberian hamsters to measure and respond to changes in day length depends upon accurate photoentrainment of the circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Two pathways have been characterized through which entraining stimuli reach the SCN: the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), which transmits light information from the retinae, and the geniculohypothalamic tract (GHT) from the intergeniculate leaflet of the thalamus (IGL), which is involved in transmitting both photic and nonphotic cues. Ablating the IGL/GHT results in only modest alterations in entrainment to static day lengths and fails to interfere with seasonal responses induced by transfer from static long day to static short day lengths. Because several studies suggest that the IGL may be involved in tracking the time of dusk and dawn, we sought to determine whether an intact IGL is necessary for hamsters to respond to a simulated natural photoperiod (SNP) in which the time of dusk and dawn gradually changes in a pattern approximating the rate of change in day length that occurs during autumn at the latitude this species inhabits in nature. The results indicate that neurochemical lesions of the IGL alter both the pattern of circadian entrainment and photoperiodic responsiveness of Siberian hamsters to an SNP. Both intact and IGL-lesioned hamsters exhibited testicular regression in shortening day lengths, but only IGL-intact hamsters exhibited seasonal pelage molt.

Abstract:Starch-gel electrophoresis was used to assess temporal and spatial genetic variation in populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in western Tennessee. Samples of liver and kidney obtained from animals at five localities during 1985-1992 were analyzed at 11 loci known to be polymorphic in white-tailed deer. There were minimal significant differences in allelic frequencies between sexes and among age groups for each year at each locality and among years at each locality with ages and sexes combined. No significant difference occurred among mean values of heterozygosity. A heterozygote deficiency was detected in white-tailed deer populations from western Tennessee and could reflect limited inbreeding but was more likely due to Wahlund effects. Limited temporal variation occurred among years within a locality and indicated a stasis in terms of minimal genetic drift and harvest effects on genetic structure of the populations. Herd origin, stocking history of populations, and gene flow were probable causes of spatial heterogeneity in deer populations in western Tennessee.

Title:High oxygen level in a soaking treatment improves early root and shoot development of black willow cuttings.
Authors:['Martin LT', 'Pezeshki SR', 'Shields FD Jr']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Black willow (Salix nigra) stem cuttings are commonly used to stabilize eroded streambanks with survival dependent on rapid development of adventitious roots to maintain plant water balance, absorb nutrients, and provide anchorage and support especially during flood and drought events. Soaking cuttings in water prior to planting increases survival and growth rates, but it is not known whether oxygen content in the soaking water affects the rate of early root and shoot initiation and growth. A laboratory experiment tested the hypothesis that cuttings treated with high oxygen (>95% saturation, 8.62 mg O2 l(-1)) soaking exhibit more rapid initiation and growth of roots and shoots than cuttings treated with low oxygen (<15% saturation, 1.24 mg O2 l(-1)) soaking and control (unsoaked). Root initiation was enhanced in both high and low O2 soaking treatments compared to control (100, 93, and 41%, respectively, n = 27). High O2 soaking led to greater root length than low O2 soaking during the fourth week after planting (26.5 and 12.3 cm on day 22; 27.7 and 19.1 cm on day 27, respectively). Shoot growth was greater in high O2 compared to low O2 soaking on days 36 and 56 after planting (9.3 and 6.3 cm on day 36, 10.7 and 7.2 cm on day 56, respectively). Shoot and root biomass production was stimulated in both soaking treatments, with 200% more biomass production by day 59 compared to control. Results of this study demonstrated that a high oxygen soaking treatment has potential for improving early root and shoot growth, and survival in willow cuttings planted at riparian restoration sites.

Title:The reduction of azo dyes by the intestinal microflora.
Authors:['Chung KT', 'Stevens SE Jr', 'Cerniglia CE']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Azo dyes are widely used in the textile, printing, paper manufacturing, pharmaceutical, and food industries and also in research laboratories. When these compounds either inadvertently or by design enter the body through ingestion, they are metabolized to aromatic amines by intestinal microorganisms. Reductive enzymes in the liver can also catalyze the reductive cleavage of the azo linkage to produce aromatic amines. However, evidence indicates that the intestinal microbial azoreductase may be more important than the liver enzymes in azo reduction. In this article, we examine the significance of the capacity of intestinal bacteria to reduce azo dyes and the conditions of azo reduction. Many azo dyes, such as Acid Yellow, Amaranth, Azodisalicylate, Chicago Sky Blue, Congo Red, Direct Black 38, Direct Blue 6, Direct Blue 15, Direct Brown 95, Fast Yellow, Lithol Red, Methyl Orange, Methyl Red, Methyl Yellow, Naphthalene Fast Orange 2G, Neoprontosil, New Coccine, Orange II, Phenylazo-2-naphthol, Ponceau 3R, Ponceau SX, Red 2G, Red 10B, Salicylazosulphapyridine, Sunset Yellow, Tartrazine, and Trypan Blue, are included in this article. A wide variety of anaerobic bacteria isolated from caecal or fecal contents from experimental animals and humans have the ability to cleave the azo linkage(s) to produce aromatic amines. Azoreductase(s) catalyze these reactions and have been found to be oxygen sensitive and to require flavins for optimal activity. The azoreductase activity in a variety of intestinal preparations was affected by various dietary factors such as cellulose, proteins, fibers, antibiotics, or supplementation with live cultures of lactobacilli.

Title:Nanospheres in phase-separating multicomponent fluids: a three-dimensional dissipative particle dynamics simulation.

Abstract:The dynamics of phase separation of three-dimensional fluids containing nanospheres, which interact preferentially with one of the two fluids, is studied by means of large-scale dissipative particle dynamics simulations. We systematically investigated the effect of volume fraction, radius, and mass of the nanoparticles on both kinetics and morphology of the binary mixture. We found that nanospheres lead to a reduction of domain growth which is intensified as their volume fraction is increased for a given radius of nanoparticles, or as the nanoparticles radius is decreased for a given volume fraction. Up to moderate volume fractions of nanoparticles, the growth law, however, is found to be identical to that pure binary fluids, i.e., R(t) approximately t(n), with n=1. For relatively high volume fractions of nanoparticles, a diffusive growth regime was detected. The crossover to the slower growth regime as the nanoparticles volume fraction is increased or their radius is decreased is associated with the crystallization of the nanospheres within the preferred component. These results are qualitatively in good agreement with previous two-dimensional simulations using molecular dynamics [M. Laradji and G. MacNevin, J. Chem. Phys. 119, 2275 (2003)] and a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model [M. Laradji, J. Chem. Phys. 120, 9330 (2004)], as well as recent experiments.

Title:Food supplementation and possible mechanisms underlying early breeding in the Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens).
Authors:['Schoech SJ', 'Bowman R', 'Reynolds SJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. sschoech@memphis.edu
Abstract:Food supplementation studies demonstrate the importance of resources in the timing of reproduction. Studies of Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) found that supplemented jays bred earlier than unsupplemented jays and that protein may play a critical role. In this study, free-living scrub-jays were provided with supplemental diets high in fat and protein (HFHP) or high in fat and low in protein (HFLP). Jays in both treatments bred earlier than unsupplemented controls (CNT), but HFHP-supplemented jays bred earlier than HFLP jays. To assess possible mechanisms, we measured testosterone (T) in males, estradiol (E2) in females, and corticosterone (CORT) in both. HFHP males had higher T than HFLP and CNT males, but treatment did not affect E2 levels of females. Pilot studies of scrub-jays in suburban environments suggest that the spatial and temporal predictability of food may influence corticosterone (CORT) levels. Suburban jays have year-round access to human-provided foods and breed earlier than wildland jays; thus, we compared CORT in all treatments in the natural site (wildlands) with those of suburban jays. CORT levels of suburban jays were lower than HFLP, HFHP, and CNT jays. HFHP-supplemented jays had lower CORT levels than those of HFLP and CNT jays. The observed differences in the timing of breeding, both between suburban and wildland populations and between experimental groups in the wildlands, may result from differences in the spatial and temporal predictability of food, and the nutritional differences in diets. Because CORT can negatively affect the reproductive axis, we postulate that nutrient availability, the predictability of food, CORT levels, and initiation of reproduction are inextricably linked.

Title:Structural characterization of methionine and leucine enkephalins by hydrogen/deuterium exchange and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.
Authors:['Cai X', 'Dass C']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Conformational changes in two endogenous opioid active pentapeptides methionine enkephalin (Met-enk) and leucine enkephalin (Leu-enk) induced by trifluoroethanol (TFE) were identified using hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX), coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry. The exchange features in individual amino acid residues were characterized by acquiring tandem mass spectra of the deuterated peptides. The exact identity of the labile hydrogens involved in HDX reveals that the monomer forms of both peptides adopt an unfolded conformation in aqueous solvent, but prefer the 5-->2 beta-turn secondary structure under the membrane-mimetic environment. The ESI mass spectra of Met-enk and Leu-enk also reveal that the dimer structure of these peptides coexists with the monomer conformation. The extent of the dimer structure is dependent on the peptide concentration and nature of the solvent. The non-polar solvents facilitate the dimer formation.

Abstract:Strength augmentation has been demonstrated in resistance-trained men subsequent to 4 days of training abstinence. However, this phenomenon was exhibited in an unusual circumstance in which the exercise test (seated heel raise) primarily involved an isolated skeletal muscle (soleus) that is normally comprised almost exclusively of 1 fiber type. It is unclear if similar results would be found for aggregate muscle actions. Therefore, a comparable study was designed with this in mind. Subjects were apparently healthy, young, strength-trained men (n = 25). All performed various tests of bench press strength at the beginning of their last standardized dynamic constant external resistance (DCER) training session. Subjects were subsequently randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups and repeated the identical tests at intervals of either 2, 3, 4, or 5 days with no intervening training. Strength tests consisted of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) concentric-only isokinetic bench presses performed at 1.49 and 0.37 m.s(-1) as well as a 1RM DCER bench press. Measures of peak force and power were obtained from the isokinetic tests and maximum load from the DCER test. Results were expressed in both absolute and relative (to body weight) terms. Subsequent to the 4 abstinence intervals, groups performed similarly (p > 0.05) for all dependent variables. Concurrently, however, a small effect size (ES) was found for the group having a 4-day respite for both absolute and relative expressions of peak force and power at the slowest isokinetic bench press velocity. A small ES was also identified for the group having 2 days of rest for relative peak force at the slowest isokinetic test velocity and for relative DCER strength. Therefore, modest and transient strength augmentation appears likely in aggregate muscle actions following 2-4 days of training abstinence in resistance-trained men, but only at relatively slow velocities.

Abstract:Is it possible that voles have a sense of number? To address this question, we determined whether voles discriminate between two different scent-marking individuals and identify the individual whose scent marks was on top more often than the other individual. We tested whether voles show a preference for the individual whose scent marks was on top most often. If so, the simplest explanation was that voles can make a relative size judgement-such as distinguishing an area containing more of one individual's over-marks as compared to less of another individual's over-marks. We found that voles respond preferentially to the donor that provided a greater number of over-marks as compared to the donor that provided a lesser number of over-marks. Thus, we concluded that voles might display the capacity for relative numerousness. Interestingly, female voles were better able than male voles to distinguish between small differences in the relative number of over-marks by the two scent donors.

Abstract:N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis is presented as a powerful approach to developing models for human disease. The efforts of three NIH Mutagenesis Centers established for the detection of neuroscience-related phenotypes are described. Each center has developed an extensive panel of phenotype screens that assess nervous system structure and function. In particular, these screens focus on complex behavioral traits from drug and alcohol responses to circadian rhythms to epilepsy. Each of these centers has developed a bioinformatics infrastructure to track the extensive number of transactions that are inherent in these large-scale projects. Over 100 new mouse mutant lines have been defined through the efforts of these three mutagenesis centers and are presented to the research community via the centralized Web presence of the Neuromice.org consortium (http://www.neuromice.org). This community resource provides visitors with the ability to search for specific mutant phenotypes, to view the genetic and phenotypic details of mutant mouse lines, and to order these mice for use in their own research program.

Abstract:This article reviews the literature on the prevalence of sleep-related motor vehicle crashes and presents a detailed analysis of the driver and context variables associated with a sample of 1,269 sleepy-driver, fatal and injury-causing vehicle crashes that occurred over a 6-year period in Tennessee. The crash profiles and trends are discussed in terms of their implications for addressing this significant problem in highway safety. Findings suggest that younger drivers, ages 15-21, are more at-risk for sleep-related motor vehicle crashes. Also, there is some evidence for the effectiveness of rumble strips in reducing sleep-related, run-off-road, interstate crashes.

Abstract:The dynamics of phase separation in multicomponent bilayer fluid vesicles is investigated by means of large-scale dissipative particle dynamics. The model explicitly accounts for solvent particles, thereby allowing for the very first numerical investigation of the effects of hydrodynamics and area-to-volume constraints. We observed regimes corresponding to coalescence of flat patches, budding and vesiculation, and coalescence of caps. We point out that the area-to-volume constraint has a strong influence on crossovers between these regimes.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To evaluate expert listeners' perceptions of voice and fluency in persons with adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD) before and after treatment with botulinum toxin type A (Botox), as a function of initial severity of the disorder (while controlling for patients' age at injection). DESIGN: Simple before-and-after trial with blinded randomized listener judgments. SETTING: Ambulatory care clinic at a single medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two consecutive patients with ADSD who underwent examination, with a 3- to 6-week follow-up, after initial botulinum toxin type A injection. There were also 42 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. INTERVENTIONS: Injections of botulinum toxin type A into the thyroarytenoid muscle(s). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Computer-implemented visual analog scaling judgments of voice quality and speech fluency made by expert listeners under psychoacoustically controlled conditions. RESULTS: Response to botulinum toxin type A varied markedly as a function of pretreatment severity of ADSD. More severe initial symptoms exhibited greater magnitudes of improvement. Patients with mild dysphonia did not exhibit pretreatment to posttreatment change. Following treatment, voice and fluency remained significantly (P<.05) poorer in ADSD than in healthy speakers. Older patients exhibited less improvement than younger patients when the effect of initial severity was statistically controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Voice quality and fluency improved for most patients following treatment, but older patients and those with milder dysphonia exhibited the least optimal responses to the procedure. Patients who were profoundly impaired demonstrated the greatest amount of improvement. Computer-implemented visual analog scaling provided a reliable clinical tool for determining treatment-related changes in those with ADSD.

Title:The roles of ADP and TXA in botrocetin/VWF-induced aggregation of washed platelets.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to the platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex initiates a cascade of events leading to alphaIIbbeta3 activation and platelet aggregation. The roles of ADP and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) in agglutination-induced GPIbalpha-mediated platelet activation have not been fully described. METHODS: Botrocetin and human VWF were used to stimulate washed mouse platelets. Platelets deficient in TXA2 receptors, Galphaq, or alphaIIbbeta3, and inhibitors and chelating agents were used to investigate the roles of TXA2, ADP, alphaIIbbeta3 and Ca2+ in botrocetin/VWF-induced signaling. RESULTS: Our data demonstrate that botrocetin/VWF/GPIbalpha-mediated agglutination results in calcium-independent protein kinase C (PKC) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activities required for GPIbalpha-elicited TXA2 production that in turn causes dense granule secretion. Aggregation of washed platelets requires TXA2-induced alphaIIbbeta3 activation and ADP signaling. TXA2 or ADP can activate alphaIIbbeta3, but both are required for alpha-granule secretion and aggregation. Botrocetin/VWF-induced dense granule secretion is Galphaq-dependent. alpha-Granule secretion requires initial ADP signaling through P2Y1 and subsequent signaling through P2Y12. Signaling initiated by agglutination is propagated and amplified in an alphaIIbbeta3-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to adhesion or shear stress-induced GPIb-elicited signaling, agglutination-elicited GPIb signaling that activates alphaIIbbeta3 requires TXA2. Agglutination-elicited TXA2 production is independent of Ca2+ influx and mobilization of internal Ca2+ stores. Therefore, our results demonstrate that agglutination-elicited GPIb signaling causes alphaIIbbeta3 activation by a mechanism that is distinct from those used by adhesion, or shear stress-induced GPIb signaling.

Abstract:The historical development of school psychology is discussed in the context of circumstances and individuals significant to its origins. The contributions of Witmer's clinical psychology and Hall's child study demonstrate how early forms of school psychology evolved from their conceptualizations. Even though the specialty did not achieve a stable national identity until the second half of the 20th century, the provision of psychological services in schools is among the earliest fields of applied psychology and has distinct connections to Witmer and Hall.

Title:Blockade of nuclear factor of activated T cells activation signaling suppresses balloon injury-induced neointima formation in a rat carotid artery model.
Authors:['Liu Z', 'Zhang C', 'Dronadula N', 'Li Q', 'Rao GN']
Affiliation:Department of Physiology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.
Abstract:We have previously reported that nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATs) play an important role in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation by receptor tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptor agonists, platelet-derived growth factor-BB and thrombin, respectively. To understand the role of NFATs in vascular disease, we have now studied the involvement of these transcription factors in neointima formation in a rat carotid artery balloon injury model. The levels of NFATc1 in injured right common carotid arteries were increased at 72 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks after balloon injury compared with its levels in uninjured left common carotid arteries. Intraperitoneal injection of cyclosporine A (CsA), a pharmacological inhibitor of the calcineurin-NFAT activation pathway, suppressed balloon injury-induced neointima formation by 40%. Similarly, adenoviral-mediated expression of GFPVIVIT, a competent peptide inhibitor of the calcineurin-NFAT activation pathway, in injured arteries also reduced neointima formation by about 40%. Furthermore, CsA and GFPVIVIT attenuated balloon injury-induced neointimal smooth muscle cell proliferation as determined by bromodeoxyuridine staining. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB induced the expression of COX-2 in cultured VSMC in a time- and NFAT-dependent manner. COX-2 expression was also increased in the right common carotid artery in a time-dependent manner after balloon injury as compared with its levels in uninjured left common carotid artery and both CsA and GFPVIVIT negated this response. Together these results for the first time demonstrate that NFATs play a critical role in neointima formation via induction of expression of COX-2.

Title:Influence of the method of blending an antibiotic powder with an acrylic bone cement powder on physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of the cured cement.

Abstract:Two variants of antibiotic powder-loaded acrylic bone cements (APLBCs) are widely used in primary total joint replacements. In the United States, the antibiotic is manually blended with the powder of the cement at the start of the procedure, while, in Europe, pre-packaged commercially-available APLBCs (in which the blending is carried out using an industrial mixer) are used. Our objective was to investigate the influence of the method of blending gentamicin sulphate with the powder of the Cemex XL formulation on a wide collection of properties of the cured cement. The blending methods used were manual mixing (the MANUAL Set), use of a small-scale, easy-to-use, commercially-available mechanical powder mixer, OmoMix 1 (the MECHANICAL Set), and use of a large-scale industrial mixer (Cemex Genta) [the INDUSTRIAL Set]. In the MECHANICAL and MANUAL Sets, the blending time was 3 min. In preparing the test specimens for each set, the blended powder used contained 4.22 wt% of the gentamicin powder. The properties determined were the strength, modulus, and work-to-fracture (all obtained under four-point bending), plane-strain fracture toughness, Weibull mean fatigue life (fatigue conditions: +/-15 MPa; 2 Hz), activation energy and frequency factor for the cement polymerization process (both determined using differential scanning calorimetry, at heating rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20 Kmin(-1)), the diffusion coefficient for the absorption of phosphate buffered saline, PBS, at 37 degrees C, and the rate of elution of the gentamicin into PBS, at 37 degrees C (E). Also determined were the particle size, particle size distribution, and morphology of the blended powders and of the gentamicin. For each of the cured cement properties (except for E), there is no statistically significant difference between the means for the 3 cements, a finding that parallels the observation that there are no significant differences in either the mean particle size or the morphology of the blended cement powders. Notwithstanding these results, it is suggested that when the powder mixture is blended in the operating room, using the OmoMix 1 is more likely to produce a more consistent and reproducible mixture than when manual mixing is used.

Abstract:Three types of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) acetabular liners were tested against cobalt-chrome (CoCr) femoral heads on a hip simulator to approximately 20 million cycles. The materials included (1) conventional, nonirradiated liners (C-PE); (2) 5 Mrad gamma-irradiated, remelted, and artificially aged liners (5-XPE); and (3) 10 Mrad gamma-irradiated, remelted, and artificially aged liners (10-XPE). Wear was quantified by gravimetric analysis and wear particle characterization. Particle number and morphology were quantified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and compared between groups. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to measure particle height in an effort to improve the total wear volume estimation. The wear debris, as characterized by SEM, was predominantly submicron and round, with occasional fibrils documented in the C-PE material. AFM analysis showed that particle height was approximately one-third of the particle equivalent circular diameter for all three materials. This correlation was used to improve the estimation of volumetric wear rate through SEM particle analysis. This technique is particularly useful for high-dose crosslinked UHMWPE, such as 10-XPE, which show weight gain due to fluid absorption during wear testing. This study has shown that particle analysis provides additional particle morphology and quantity information that cannot be obtained through gravimetric analysis.

Title:Who wants a hearing aid? Personality profiles of hearing aid seekers.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC', 'Gray GA']
Affiliation:The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Evidence indicates that elderly hearing-impaired people who use amplification live happier, healthier, and longer lives than those who do not. Nevertheless, only a small fraction (approximately 23%) of hearing-impaired adults actually seek and use hearing aids. This study explored the personalities of hearing aid seekers in an attempt to determine whether those who seek hearing aids are systematically different from the general population. DESIGN: In this cross-sectional survey, self-report data were obtained from 230 older adults with bilateral, symmetrical, sensorineural, mild to moderately severe hearing impairment. Subjects were representative of patients served either in a publicly funded hospital-based system (VA) or in a free-standing private practice system (PP). All subjects were seeking new hearing aids. Subjects completed a comprehensive personality questionnaire (NEO-Five-Factor Inventory) as well as questionnaires determining locus of control and preferred coping strategies. RESULTS: Individuals who seek amplification are not simply a random sample of the general population and presumably not a random sample of the hearing-impaired population. Compared with the typical adult, hearing aid seekers tended to be more pragmatic and routine-oriented and probably less imaginative in coming up with novel approaches to dealing with a complex problem such as hearing impairment. These individuals also were found to feel relatively more personally powerful in dealing with life's challenges. Further, hearing aid seekers reported using social support coping strategies less frequently than their non-hearing-impaired peers. In addition, there were significant differences in personality patterns between hearing aid seekers in the PP and VA systems. Differences noted in the personality traits of Openness and Neuroticism might be a useful guide to selecting treatment approaches and expectations for patients in each setting. Additional differences in Agreeableness imply that patients in the private practice system were more trusting than those in the general population, whereas this was not seen for patients in the public health VA system. One interpretation of this finding is that hearing-impaired individuals who are more suspicious and cynical are reluctant to try amplification in the PP system. This observation underscores the need to improve the public image of hearing health care to increase the uptake of hearing aids in general. CONCLUSIONS: Although individual hearing aid seekers display personality characteristics within the range of normal, this study suggested that they are not simply a random sample of the general population. Possible explanations are offered for significant personality differences, and potential clinical relevance is noted for some effects. The data also point to a need to improve the public image of hearing health care in the PP system.

Title:The beta3 subunit of the integrin alphaIIbbeta3 regulates alphaIIb-mediated outside-in signaling.
Authors:['Liu J', 'Jackson CW', 'Gruppo RA', 'Jennings LK', 'Gartner TK']
Affiliation:Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Bidirectional signaling is an essential feature of alphaIIbbeta3 function. The alphaIIb cytoplasmic domain negatively regulates beta3-mediated inside-out signaling, but little is known about the regulation of alphaIIb-mediated outside-in signaling. We show that alphaIIb-mediated outside-in signaling is enhanced in platelets of a patient lacking the terminal 39 residues of the beta3 cytoplasmic tail. This enhanced signaling was detected as thromboxane A(2) (TxA(2)) production and granule secretion, and required ligand cross-linking of alphaIIbbeta3 and platelet aggregation. This outside-in signaling was specifically inhibited by a palmitoylated version of a beta3 peptide corresponding to cytoplasmic domain residues R724-R734. Unlike the palmitoylated peptide, the nonpalmitoylated beta3 peptide could not cross the platelet membrane and did not inhibit this outside-in signaling. The physiologic relevance of this beta3-mediated negative regulation of alphaIIb outside-in signaling was demonstrated in normal platelets treated with the palmitoylated peptide and a physiologic agonist. Binding of alphaIIbbeta3 complexes to immobilized peptides demonstrated that a peptide corresponding to beta3 residues R724-R734 appears to bind to an alphaIIb cytoplasmic domain peptide containing residues K989-D1002, but not to control peptides. These results demonstrate that alphaIIb-mediated outside-in signaling resulting in TxA(2) production and granule secretion is negatively regulated by a sequence of residues in the membrane distal beta3 cytoplasmic domain sequence RKEFAKFEEER.

Abstract:Patterns of gene expression in the central nervous system are highly variable and heritable. This genetic variation among normal individuals leads to considerable structural, functional and behavioral differences. We devised a general approach to dissect genetic networks systematically across biological scale, from base pairs to behavior, using a reference population of recombinant inbred strains. We profiled gene expression using Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays in the BXD recombinant inbred strains, for which we have extensive SNP and haplotype data. We integrated a complementary database comprising 25 years of legacy phenotypic data on these strains. Covariance among gene expression and pharmacological and behavioral traits is often highly significant, corroborates known functional relations and is often generated by common quantitative trait loci. We found that a small number of major-effect quantitative trait loci jointly modulated large sets of transcripts and classical neural phenotypes in patterns specific to each tissue. We developed new analytic and graph theoretical approaches to study shared genetic modulation of networks of traits using gene sets involved in neural synapse function as an example. We built these tools into an open web resource called WebQTL that can be used to test a broad array of hypotheses.

Abstract:Formant frequencies were determined from vocalic utterances of a prelinguistically deafened child implanted with a Nucleus 22-channel device at age 5 years. Speech samples were obtained from recordings of speech made 5 and 2 months prior to implantation and at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months post implantation. Prior to implantation, first formant values showed a greater range than those of normal hearing children of comparable age, and second formant values showed a greatly reduced range and clustered around a mean of 1800 Hz. By 36 months post implantation, first formant values approximated age-matched norms. By 6 months post implantation, higher second formant values were apparent. A progressive shift in second formant values was noted through 36 months post implantation when the vocalic space most closely corresponded to age-matched normative data.

Abstract:The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is considered to be one of the driving forces in the basal ganglia circuit. The STN is innervated by serotonergic afferents from the raphe nucleus and expresses a variety of 5-HT receptor subtypes. We investigated the effects of 5-HT and 5-HT receptor subtype agonists and antagonists on the firing properties of STN neurons in rat brain slices. We used cell-attached, perforated-patch, and whole cell recording techniques to detect changes in firing frequency and pattern and electrical membrane properties. Due to the depolarization of membrane potential caused by reduced potassium conductance, 5-HT (10 microM) increased the firing frequency of STN neurons without changing their firing pattern. Cadmium failed to occlude the effect of 5-HT on firing frequency. 5-HT had no effect on afterhyperpolarization current. These results indicated that the 5-HT action was not mediated by high-voltage-activated calcium channel currents and calcium-dependent potassium currents. 5-HT had no effect on hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I(H)) amplitude and voltage-dependence of I(H) activation, suggesting that I(H) was not involved in 5-HT-induced excitation. The increased firing by 5-HT was mimicked by 5-HT(2/4) receptor agonist alpha-methyl-5-HT and was partially mimicked by 5-HT2 receptor agonist DOI or 5-HT4 receptor agonist cisapride. The 5-HT action was partially reversed by 5-HT4 receptor antagonist SB 23597-190, 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin, and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist RS 102221. Our data indicate that 5-HT has significant ability to modulate membrane excitability in STN neurons; modulation is accomplished by decreasing potassium conductance by activating 5-HT4 and 5-HT2C receptors.

Abstract:UNLABELLED: The purpose of this investigation was to understand, from the perspective of the speaker, how seven adults have been able to successfully manage their stuttering. Individual experiences were obtained across the three temporal stages (past, transitional, and current). Recurring themes were identified across participants in order to develop an essential structure of the phenomena at each stage. The ability to make the transition from unsuccessful to successful management of stuttering was associated with six recurring themes of: (1) support, (2) successful therapy, (3) self therapy and behavioral change, (4) cognitive change, (5) utilization of personal experience, and (6) high levels of motivation/determination. Six recurring themes associated with past experiences, when stuttering was unsuccessfully managed, included: (1) gradual awareness, (2) negative reactions of listeners, (3) negative emotions, (4) restrictive lifestyle, (5) avoidance, and (6) inadequate therapy. The five recurring themes identified for the current situation where stuttering continues to be successfully managed were: (1) continued management, (2) self acceptance and fear reduction, (3) unrestricted interactions, (4) sense of freedom, (5) and optimism. EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES: The reader will be able to: (1) describe, from the prospective of a select group of adults who stutter, the recurring themes associated with both unsuccessful and successful management of stuttering, (2) explain the recurring themes associated with how this group of seven adults achieved successful management of their stuttering, and (3) discuss the basic rationale and procedures associated with phenomenological analysis.

Abstract:Bayesian network modeling is a promising approach to define and evaluate gene expression circuits in diverse tissues and cell types under different experimental conditions. The power and practicality of this approach can be improved by restricting the number of potential interactions among genes and by defining causal relations before evaluating posterior probabilities for billions of networks. A newly developed genetical genomics method that combines transcriptome profiling with complex trait analysis now provides strong constraints on network architecture. This method detects those chromosomal intervals responsible for differences in mRNA expression using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. We have developed an efficient Bayesian approach that exploits the genetical genomics method to focus computational effort on the most plausible gene modulatory networks. We exploit a dense marker map for a genetic reference population (GRP) that consists of 32 BXD strains of mice made by intercrossing two progenitor strains--C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. These progenitors differ at approximately 1.3 million known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), all of which can be exploited to estimate the probability that a gene contains functional polymorphisms that segregate within the GRP. We constructed 66 candidate networks that include all the candidate modulator genes located in the 209 statistically significant trans-acting QTL regions. SNPs that distinguish between the two progenitor strains were used to further winnow the list of candidate modulators. Bayesian network was then used to identify the genetic modulatory relations that best explain the microarray data.

Title:Weighting by heritability for detection of quantitative trait loci with microarray estimates of gene expression.

Abstract:Heritable differences in transcribed RNA levels can be mapped as quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Transcribed RNA levels are often measured by hybridization to microarrays of oligonucleotide probes, in which each transcript is represented by multiple probes. The use of recombinant inbred lines allows an estimate of the heritability of expression measured by individual probes. This heritability varies greatly. We have tested heritability-weighted averages to define expression of a transcript and found that these allow detection of more QTLs than previously described methods.

Abstract:Although teniposide (VM26) and etoposide (VP16) are eliminated mostly by nonrenal mechanisms, their cytochrome P450 metabolism in humans has not been reported. Our objective was to determine the affinity and capacity of P450 O-demethylation of VM26 and VP16 in a variety of human livers. Formation of catechols of VM26 and VP16 was detected in 24 and 26 of 26 liver microsomal preparations, respectively, with wide variability in maximum catechol formation rates from VM26 (41-fold) and VP16 (39-fold range), even among normal livers. Maximal activity measurements at 500 microM substrate were lower for VM26 catechol formation (mean = 1.5 nmol/mg/hr) than for VP16 catechol (mean = 3.2 nmol/mg/hr) in 26 livers (P less than .001). Maximal activities for VP16 and VM26 O-demethylation, and ethoxycoumarin O-deethylation were significantly higher in normal than in diseased livers. No differences were found in activities related to age, sex or race of the liver donor. In all five livers tested over a range of substrate concentrations, Km (19.7, 23.2, 43.5, 30.1 and 22.0 microM) and Vmax values (1.0, 1.2, 4.4, 8.2 and 4.0 nmol/mg/hr) for VM26 were lower compared to values for VP16 (Km = 60.2, 115.1, 87.3, 42.1 and 81.9 microM; Vmax = 1.4, 3.3, 10.3, 27.5 and 10.1 nmol/mg/hr). Despite higher VP16 catechol formation, VM26 underwent greater overall reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent metabolism than VP16, consistent with greater nonrenal clearance of VM26 in vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Title:Influence of the radiopacifier in an acrylic bone cement on its mechanical, thermal, and physical properties: barium sulfate-containing cement versus iodine-containing cement.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'van Hooy-Corstjens CS', 'Bhattaram A', 'Koole LH']

Abstract:In all acrylic bone cement formulations in clinical use today, radiopacity is provided by micron-sized particles (typical mean diameter of between about 1 and 2 microm) of either BaSO(4) or ZrO(2). However, a number of research reports have highlighted the fact that these particles have deleterious effects on various properties of the cured cement. Thus, there is interest in alternative radiopacifiers. The present study focuses on one such alternative. Specifically, a cement that contains covalently bound iodine in the powder (herein designated the I-cement) was compared with a commercially available cement of comparable composition (C-ment3), in which radiopacity is provided by BaSO(4) particles (this cement is herein designated the B-cement), on the basis of the strength (sigma(b)), modulus (E(b)), and work-to-fracture (U(b)), under four-point bending, plane-strain fracture toughness (K(IC)), Weibull mean fatigue life, N(WM) (fatigue conditions: +/-15 MPa; 2 Hz), activation energy (Q), and frequency factor (ln Z) for the cement polymerization process (both determined by using differential scanning calorimetry at heating rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20 K min(-1)), and the diffusion coefficient for the absorption of phosphate-buffered saline at 37 degrees C (D). For the B-cement, the values of sigma(b), E(b), U(b), K(IC), N(WM), Q, ln Z, and D were 53 +/- 3 MPa, 3000 +/- 120 MPa, 108 +/- 15 kJ m(-3), 1.67 +/- 0.02 MPa check mark m, 7197 cycles, 243 +/- 17 kJ mol(-1), 87 +/- 6, and (3.15 +/- 0.94) x 10(-12) m(2) s(-1), respectively. For the I-cement, the corresponding values were 58 +/- 5 MPa, 2790 +/- 140 MPa, 118 +/- 45 kJ m(-3), 1.73 +/- 0.11 MPa check mark m, 5520 cycles, 267 +/- 19 kJ mol(-1), 95 +/- 9, and (3.83 +/- 0.25) x 10(-12) m(2) s(-1). For each of the properties of the fully cured cement, except for the rate constant of the polymerization reaction, at 37 degrees C (k'), as estimated from the Q and ln Z results, there is no statistically significant difference between the two cements. k' for the I-cement was about a third that for the B-cement, suggesting that the former cement has a higher thermal stability. The influence of various characteristics of the starting powder (mean particle size, particle size distribution, and morphology) on the properties of the cured cements appears to be complex. When all the present results are considered, there is a clear indication that the I-cement is a viable candidate cement for use in cemented arthroplasties in place of the B-cement.

Title:Early embryonic lethality in mice with targeted deletion of the CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase alpha gene (Pcyt1a).

Abstract:CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) catalyzes a rate-controlling step in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho). Multiple CCT isoforms, CCTalpha, CCTbeta2, and CCTbeta3, are encoded by two genes, Pcyt1a and Pcyt1b. The importance of CCTalpha in mice was investigated by deleting exons 5 and 6 in the Pcyt1a gene using the Cre-lox system. Pcyt1a-/- zygotes failed to form blastocysts, did not develop past embryonic day 3.5 (E3.5), and failed to implant. In situ hybridization in E11.5 embryos showed that Pcyt1a is expressed ubiquitously, with the highest level in fetal liver, and CCTalpha transcripts are significantly more abundant than transcripts encoding CCTbeta or phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) N-methyl transferase, two other enzymes capable of producing PtdCho. Reduction of the CCTalpha transcripts in heterozygous E11.5 embryos was accompanied by upregulation of CCTbeta and PtdEtn N-methyltransferase transcripts. In contrast, enzymatic and real-time PCR data revealed that CCTbeta (Pcyt1b) expression is not upregulated to compensate for the reduction in CCTalpha expression in adult liver and other tissues from Pcyt1a+/- heterozygous mice. PtdCho biosynthesis measured by choline incorporation into isolated hepatocytes was not compromised in the Pcyt1a+/- mice. Liver PtdCho mass was the same in Pcyt1a+/+ and Pcyt1a+/- adult animals, but lung PtdCho mass decreased in the heterozygous mice. These data show that CCTalpha expression is required for early embryonic development, but that a 50% reduction in enzyme activity has little detectable impact on the operation of the CDP-choline metabolic pathway in adult tissues.

Title:Insomnia and complicated grief symptoms in bereaved college students.
Authors:['Hardison HG', 'Neimeyer RA', 'Lichstein KL']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:In this study, we extended previous research by concentrating on sleep- and grief-related symptoms in a cohort of bereaved college students, in view of the potential for each of these problems to exacerbate the other. A sample of 815 college students completed the Inventory of Complicated Grief (H. G. Prigerson & S. C. Jacobs, 2001), along with an assessment of diagnostic criteria for insomnia and associated sleep behaviors. As predicted, the rate of insomnia was significantly higher (22%) in the bereaved sample than in a nonbereaved comparison group (17%), a difference that was particularly pronounced in terms of middle insomnia. Also as hypothesized, bereaved insomniacs reported higher complicated grief scores than bereaved noninsomniacs, and several specific sleep variables (including sleep-onset insomnia related to nighttime rumination about the loss and sleep-maintenance insomnia associated with dreaming of the deceased) were significantly related to complicated grief symptomatology.

Abstract:Waterpipe smoking has increased dramatically worldwide in recent years, with an estimated 100 million daily users. Research on this traditional Middle Eastern tobacco use method is in its infancy, and little is known about users' cessation-related attitudes and experiences. A random sample of 268 narghile (waterpipe) smokers (40% female; mean age = 30 years; range = 18-68) was obtained from cafes and restaurants in Aleppo, Syria. The majority of users (86.5%) believed they could quit using waterpipes at any time, but that belief was inversely related to perceived dependence, with only 48.7% of those who thought they were "very hooked" believing they could quit. Interest in quitting was expressed by 28.4% of subjects, with the majority (89.2%) reporting health concerns as a primary reason, and 59.2% having made an unsuccessful quit attempt in the past year. In a logistic regression model, independent predictors of interest in quitting included being married, having smoked for fewer years, not increasing the frequency of smoking over time, and having family members who do not smoke a waterpipe and disapprove of its use. Results indicate that a sizable percentage of waterpipe users express interest in quitting and have tried unsuccessfully in the past to quit. Waterpipe use needs to be considered in developing effective tobacco use cessation programs in the Middle East.

Title:Re-feeding and the restoration of odor attractivity, odor preference, and sexual receptivity in food-deprived female meadow voles.
Authors:['Pierce AA', 'Ferkin MH']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. apierce1@memphis.edu
Abstract:Food-deprived meadow voles were used to test predictions of two hypotheses associated with the recovery of sexual behaviors following re-feeding. Specifically, we tested between the body weight set point and metabolic fuels hypotheses. To do so, we determined whether the body weight of previously food-deprived female voles had to return to pre-food deprivation levels before they would recover their sexual behaviors. The body weight set point hypothesis predicts that food-deprived females that were re-fed will recover their sexual behavior after they return to their original body weight. In contrast, the metabolic fuels hypothesis predicts that food-deprived females that were re-fed will recover their sexual behavior before they return to their original body weight. That is, when the females are in positive energy balance. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, female voles were food deprived for 24 h, which is sufficient to inhibit all three components of sexual behavior. The food-deprived females were then supplied ad libitum food for 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, or 96 h and weighed. Females were then tested for their sexual behaviors (odor attractivity, odor preference or proceptivity, sexual receptivity). Re-feeding for 48 h was sufficient to restore odor attractivity, 72 h was sufficient to restore odor preferences for opposite sex conspecific odors, and 96 h was sufficient to restore sexual receptivity to those similar to that of females that were not food deprived. The time-points that the behaviors were recovered were prior to voles recovering their initial body weight. Thus, the data support the metabolic fuels hypothesis.

Affiliation:Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38105.
Abstract:Few objective analysis techniques have been developed for, or applied to, the auditory evoked middle latency response (MLR). This report demonstrates the applicability of the Fsp statistical technique (Elberling and Don, 1984) to the MLR time domain. Subjects for this study were 10 normal hearing young adults. The stimuli were 60, 40, 20 dB nHL clicks and a NS control. Evoked responses were obtained as a series of 10,000 individual traces for each stimulus presentation and analyzed off line to determine the applicability of the Fsp technique. In addition, the effects of filtering and time window size were examined to determine the optimum collection characteristics for the Fsp analysis method. The results indicate that the Fsp technique is a viable tool for estimating signal-to-noise characteristics of the MLR. When using the Fsp technique with the MLR the high-pass filter should be set to 20 Hz so that a 50-msec time window can be used.

Abstract:3-(Triethoxysilyl)propionitrile (TESPN) sol-gel has been prepared under different conditions. It was employed for coating the surfaces of quartz and aluminum. Infrared (IR) and Raman spectra of TESPN and TESPN sol-gels have been recorded in the study of the sol-gel process. Transmission and reflection absorption IR (RAIR) spectra of TESPN sol-gel coated quartz and aluminum have also been collected for better understanding the film formation on the substrate surfaces. Spectra collected at different temperatures indicated that the silane film on quartz decomposes at 700 degrees C. Results from thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) supported this result. Based on the group frequencies and the spectral behavior in different states, some vibrational modes were assigned to the observed bands. The anticorrosion behavior of the sol-gel coated aluminum in comparison with the uncoated metal was evaluated by measuring the potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS).

Title:Molecular basis for the specificity of p27 toward cyclin-dependent kinases that regulate cell division.

Abstract:The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) bind to and directly regulate the catalytic activity of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)/cyclin complexes involved in cell cycle control and do not regulate other, closely related Cdks. We showed previously that the CKI, p27, binds to Cdk2/cyclin A though a sequential mechanism that involves folding-on-binding. The first step in the kinetic mechanism is interaction of a small, highly dynamic domain of p27 (domain 1) with the cyclin subunit of the Cdk2/cyclin A complex, followed by much slower binding of a more lengthy and less flexible domain (domain 2) to Cdk2. The second step requires folding of domain 2 into the kinase inhibitory conformation. Rapid binding of p27 domain 1 to cyclin A tethers the inhibitor to the binary Cdk2/cyclin A complex, which reduces the entropic barrier associated with slow binding of domain 2 to the catalytic subunit. We show here that p27/cyclin interactions are an important determinant of p27 specificity towards cell cycle Cdks. We used surface plasmon resonance, limited proteolysis, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy to study the interaction of p27 with Cdk2/cyclin A, and with another Cdk complex, Cdk5/p25, that is involved in neurodegeneration. Importantly, Cdk5/p35 (the parent complex of Cdk5/p25) is not regulated by p27 in neurons. Our results show that p27 binds to Cdk5 and Cdk2 with similar, slow kinetics. However, p27 fails to interact with p25 within the Cdk5/p25 complex, which we believe prevents formation of a kinetically trapped, inhibited p27/Cdk5/p25 complex in vivo. The helical topology of p25 is very similar to that of cyclin A. However, p25 lacks the MRAIL sequence in one helix that, in the cell cycle cyclins, mediates specific interactions with domain 1 of p21 and p27. Our results strongly suggest that p21 and p27, related Cdk inhibitors, select their cell cycle regulatory Cdk targets by binding specifically to the cyclin subunit of these Cdk/cyclin complexes as a first step in a sequential, folding-on-binding mechanism.

Abstract:Late postirradiation hearing loss has been well described in the adult population. Few reports exist on the pediatric population. We conducted a retrospective review of 157 consecutive children with brain tumors treated exclusively with irradiation at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. Twenty-six patients developed a hearing loss, 74 did not, and 57 were excluded because of incomplete records. We report a statistically significant 27.41% cumulative risk of a stringent 20-dB hearing loss in the voice frequency range by the fifth year after radiotherapy. The right side demonstrated a significant frequency effect, with a higher incidence of loss in the higher-frequency region. We found no difference in cumulative incidence of hearing shift between the low-, middle-, and high-frequency ranges for either ear. This risk should be anticipated and managed as part of the treatment plan for radiotherapy for the treatment of malignancies. Radiation-induced hearing loss is important to acknowledge so that techniques of hyperfractionation, total dose, ports, preservative infusion medical therapy, or prolonged medical intervention (such as anticoagulants) can be developed that might reduce this disabling problem of postirradiation sensorineural hearing loss in future patients.

Abstract:Angiotensin II and the arachidonic acid metabolite derived via cytochrome P450 20-hydroxyeicostetraenoic acid promote vasoconstriction and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. This study was conducted to determine if 20-hydroxyeicostetraenoic acid contributes to angiotensin II-induced neointimal formation in balloon-injured rat carotid artery. In anesthetized rats, the drugs were infused into the clamped segment of the injured right common carotid artery for 60 minutes. The drug solution and catheter were withdrawn, the common carotid artery was ligated, and blood flow was restored. Exposure of the injured artery to angiotensin II (200 nmol/L) or arachidonic acid (10 micromol/L) increased neointimal thickening at day 14 (intima/media ratio 0.71+/-0.14 with vehicle versus 1.65+/-0.10 with angiotensin II or 1.31+/-0.13 with arachidonic acid; P<0.05). Cytochrome P450 4A1 antisense, but not scrambled, oligodeoxynucleotide (100 nmol/L) reduced angiotensin II-induced or arachidonic acid-induced neointimal thickening (intima/media ratio 0.90+/-0.07 for angiotensin II and 0.95+/-0.06 for arachidonic acid). 20-hydroxyeicostetraenoic acid (0.5 micromol/L) also increased neointimal thickening of injured artery (intima/media ratio 1.15+/-0.03); this was not altered by cytochrome P450 4A1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. Angiotensin II, arachidonic acid, and 20-hydroxyeicostetraenoic acid also induced the expression of cytochrome P450 4A and increased the number of CD45-positive cells; the latter effect of angiotensin II and arachidonic acid, but not 20-hydroxyeicostetraenoic acid, was diminished by cytochrome P450 4A1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide. These data suggest that arachidonic acid metabolites derived via cytochrome P450 4A, most likely 20-hydroxyeicostetraenoic acid, mediate angiotensin II-induced neointimal thickening in injured rat carotid artery.

Abstract:STUDY DESIGN: Mechanobiology study of gene expression changes as a result of compressive overload of anular fibrochondrocytes. OBJECTIVE: To test hypotheses regarding phenotype shift in genes coding for representative extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and matrix modulators. SUMMARY OF THE BACKGROUND DATA: In degenerative disc disease, the transfer of compressive load through the disc shifts largely from the nucleus onto the anulus. In vivo models simulating this condition have shown derangement of the collagenous ultrastructure in the anulus. In vitro models of cultured anulus cells subjected to static compressive stress generally suggest a down-regulation of synthesis. This study evaluated the expression of specific isomers of genes responsible for mechanical viability and metabolism of the disc under cyclic compressive loads. METHODS: Fibrochondrocytes were digested from the anuli of 3, 2-week-old pigs, embedded in 1.5% alginate gel, and hydrostatically compressed at 0.5 Hz for 3 hours to amplitudes of 10 and 30 atm. These levels represented nominal load transfer through the healthy disc and high load transfer through the degenerative disc. Ribonucleic acid was isolated, reverse transcribed, and evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction for expression of type I (C-I) and type II (C-II) collagen, aggrecan, the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1), and the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta-1). Results were expressed at percentages of uncompressed controls. RESULTS: The lower pressure of 10 atm resulted in up-regulation of all ECM protein genes. C-I and C-II both averaged 141%, and aggrecan 121% of controls (P < 0.05). MMP-1 and TGFbeta-1 were essentially unchanged. With the pressure increased to 30 atm, C-II remained approximately at the level expressed under lower pressure, but C-I was reduced to 42% of controls (P < 0.05), indicating a phenotype shift. MMP-1 and TGFbeta-1 also were down-regulated to 71% and 54% of controls, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The up-regulation of the ECM genes with nominal pressure highlights the mechanobiological importance of common activity in fibrocartilage homeostasis. Differential regulation of the 2 primary collagen types with high pressure indicates a capacity of the anulus to remodel according to pathomechanical conditions.

Title:Myosin heavy chain isoform expression and in vivo isometric performance: a regression model.
Authors:['Schilling BK', 'Fry AC', 'Chiu LZ', 'Weiss LW']
Affiliation:Human Performance Laboratories, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. bschllng@memphis.edu
Abstract:This investigation estimated the amount of variance in voluntary in vivo muscle performance that can be explained by relative myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform expression. The role of the relative expression of these proteins in relation to in vitro force and velocity performance is well understood, but the in vivo model is less clear. Twenty-two men and women (mean +/- SD age, 27 +/- 6 years) performed isometric knee extensor actions in which peak force and rate of force development (RFD) were measured. The results of regression analysis showed that the inclusion of MHC IIb explained a significant (19.9%, p < 0.05) amount of variance in relative peak force (adjusted for muscle mass) and 14.1% of the variance in the first half of the rise phase of the force-time curve (RFD(0-50%)) (p < 0.1). The addition of MHC I into this model explained a significant (p < 0.05) amount of variance above that accounted for by MHC IIb in RFD (45.4%), RFD(0-50%) (50.8%), and RFD(50-100%) (second half of the rise phase of the force-time curve) (37.4%). Since the percentage of MHC IIb is reduced rather quickly with training, these data suggest that peak force may also be affected quickly by training. The percentage of MHC I has a longer course for change with training; therefore, it may be inferred that the greatest changes in RFD variables will likely occur during a longer course.

Abstract:The purpose of this study was to compare oxidative modification of blood proteins, lipids, DNA, and glutathione in the 24 hours following aerobic and anaerobic exercise using similar muscle groups. Ten cross-trained men (24.3 +/- 3.8 years, [mean +/- SEM]) performed in random order 30 minutes of continuous cycling at 70% of Vo(2)max and intermittent dumbbell squatting at 70% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM), separated by 1-2 weeks, in a crossover design. Blood samples taken before, and immediately, 1, 6, and 24 hours postexercise were analyzed for plasma protein carbonyls (PC), plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), and whole-blood total (TGSH), oxidized (GSSG), and reduced (GSH) glutathione. Blood samples taken before and 24 hours postexercise were analyzed for serum 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). PC values were greater at 6 and 24 hours postexercise compared with pre-exercise for squatting, with greater PC values at 24 hours postexercise for squatting compared with cycling (0.634 +/- 0.053 vs. 0.359 +/- 0.018 nM.mg protein(-1)). There was no significant interaction or main effects for MDA or 8-OHdG. GSSG experienced a short-lived increase and GSH a transient decrease immediately following both exercise modes. These data suggest that 30 minutes of aerobic and anaerobic exercise performed by young, cross-trained men (a) can increase certain biomarkers of oxidative stress in blood, (b) differentially affect oxidative stress biomarkers, and (c) result in a different magnitude of oxidation based on the macromolecule studied. Practical applications: While protein and glutathione oxidation was increased following acute exercise as performed in this study, future research may investigate methods of reducing macromolecule oxidation, possibly through the use of antioxidant therapy.

Affiliation:Department of Health and Sport Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. kdward@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Testicular cancer (TC) is the most common neoplasm affecting males between 15 and 35, and testicular self-examination (TSE) has been recommended for early detection. Studies have found that young adult men have poor awareness of TC and low rates of performing TSE, but little research has examined adolescents. METHODS: In a comprehensive survey of health behaviors among adolescent boys (n = 213, mean age 15.4 years) who participated in a community-based youth organization (Boy Scouts of America), we assessed whether respondents had heard of TC and the frequency of performing TSE. RESULTS: Nearly 73% of scouts had heard of TC, but only 10.3% performed TSE at levels consistent with current recommendations (10 or more times per year). Compared to whites, blacks were less knowledgeable about TC and less likely to perform TSE. Knowledge of TC also was associated with participation in physical education classes and the intention to graduate from college. TSE was associated with greater health care access and the use of personal flotation devices during water activities. CONCLUSION: TSE is underutilized as an early cancer detection tool. Efforts are needed to increase TC knowledge among black adolescents and to integrate TSE education with promotion of healthy behaviors in community organizations.

Abstract:Antifungal agents exert their activity through a variety of mechanisms, some of which are poorly understood. We examined changes in the gene expression profile of Candida albicans following exposure to representatives of the four currently available classes of antifungal agents used in the treatment of systemic fungal infections. Ketoconazole exposure increased expression of genes involved in lipid, fatty acid, and sterol metabolism, including NCP1, MCR1, CYB5, ERG2, ERG3, ERG10, ERG25, ERG251, and that encoding the azole target, ERG11. Ketoconazole also increased expression of several genes associated with azole resistance, including CDR1, CDR2, IFD4, DDR48, and RTA3. Amphotericin B produced changes in the expression of genes involved in small-molecule transport (ENA21), and in cell stress (YHB1, CTA1, AOX1, and SOD2). Also observed was decreased expression of genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, including ERG3 and ERG11. Caspofungin produced changes in expression of genes encoding cell wall maintenance proteins, including the beta-1,3-glucan synthase subunit GSL22, as well as PHR1, ECM21, ECM33, and FEN12. Flucytosine increased the expression of proteins involved in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, including YNK1, FUR1, and that encoding its target, CDC21. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was used to confirm microarray results. Genes responding similarly to two or more drugs were also identified. These data shed new light on the effects of these classes of antifungal agents on C. albicans.

Abstract:We model the dynamical behavior of the neuropil, the densely interconnected neural tissue in the cortex, using neuropercolation approach. Neuropercolation generalizes phase transitions modeled by percolation theory of random graphs, motivated by properties of neurons and neural populations. The generalization includes (1) a noisy component in the percolation rule, (2) a novel depression function in addition to the usual arousal function, (3) non-local interactions among nodes arranged on a multi-dimensional lattice. This paper investigates the role of non-local (axonal) connections in generating and modulating phase transitions of collective activity in the neuropil. We derived a relationship between critical values of the noise level and non-locality parameter to control the onset of phase transitions. Finally, we propose a potential interpretation of ontogenetic development of the neuropil maintaining a dynamical state at the edge of criticality.

Title:Chaotic neurodynamics for autonomous agents.
Authors:['Harter D', 'Kozma R']
Affiliation:Division of Computer Science, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Mesoscopic level neurodynamics study the collective dynamical behavior of neural populations. Such models are becoming increasingly important in understanding large-scale brain processes. Brains exhibit aperiodic oscillations with a much more rich dynamical behavior than fixed-point and limit-cycle approximation allow. Here we present a discretized model inspired by Freeman's K-set mesoscopic level population model. We show that this version is capable of replicating the important principles of aperiodic/chaotic neurodynamics while being fast enough for use in real-time autonomous agent applications. This simplification of the K model provides many advantages not only in terms of efficiency but in simplicity and its ability to be analyzed in terms of its dynamical properties. We study the discrete version using a multilayer, highly recurrent model of the neural architecture of perceptual brain areas. We use this architecture to develop example action selection mechanisms in an autonomous agent.

Title:A battery of olfactory-based screens for phenotyping the social and sexual behaviors of mice.
Authors:['Ferkin MH', 'Li HZ']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Ellington Hall, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. mhferkin@memphis.edu
Abstract:We provide a battery of screens that reflect the social and sexual behavior displayed by both captive and feral mice. Some screens focus on measuring aspects of chemical communication, providing information about whether or not mice will interact and if they do so, predict the nature of the interaction. Other screens measure direct interactions between target mice and same- and opposite-sex conspecifics, providing an indication of the social status and sexual responsiveness, respectively, of target mice. The battery of screens yields a high-throughput bioassay of a mouse's relative social status, competitive ability, social discrimination, and sexuality. These traits are essential elements of the socio-sexual behavior of mice as well as humans. Thus, by identifying phenotypic deviants for complex behaviors we will allow geneticists to map behavioral abnormalities onto specific chromosomes and increase the efficacy of genetically altered mice as models for human behavioral disorders.

Title:The State Children's Health Insurance Program: has it reduced the percentage of uninsured children?
Authors:['Menifield CE', 'Fletcher A']
Affiliation:Division of Public and Nonprofit Administration, University of Memphis, USA.
Abstract:Recent data indicate that the percentage of children in the United States who are uninsured is declining. Although many factors have contributed to that decline, this study assesses the role of public health insurance, specifically the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), in reducing the percentage of uninsured children without health insurance from 1998-2000 and whether Medicaid and SCHIP crowd out exists. While this research confirms a significant decline in the percentage of uninsured children since SCHIP began enrolling children in 1998, other factors, including the poverty rate, the percentage of children on Medicaid, geographic region and race had a greater impact in explaining that result than SCHIP. Lastly, the data findings are consistent with research suggesting crowd out does exist.

Abstract:Despite the multifocal complexity of the matrix model (C.R. Snyder & T.R. Elliott, this issue, pp. 1033-1054), its close correspondence with the theoretical dialectics and philosophy of clinical constructivism auger well for its capacity to articulate with existing approaches to graduate education in psychology. In this article points of contact are documented between the two approaches, and a caveat is included about the limits of the matrix model in ensuring greater relevance of clinical training to the settings in which contemporary professionals will work.

Affiliation:[1] Center for Earthquake Research and Information, [2] Department of Earth Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:In the winter of 1811-1812, near the town of New Madrid in the central United States and more than 2,000 km from the nearest plate boundary, three earthquakes within three months shook the entire eastern half of the country and liquefied the ground over distances far greater than any historic earthquake in North America. The origin and modern significance of these earthquakes, however, is highly contentious. Geological evidence demonstrates that liquefaction due to strong ground shaking, similar in scale to that generated by the New Madrid earthquakes, has occurred at least three and possibly four times in the past 2,000 years (refs 4-6), consistent with recurrence statistics derived from regional seismicity. Here we show direct evidence for rapid strain rates in the area determined from a continuously operated global positioning system (GPS) network. Rates of strain are of the order of 10(-7) per year, comparable in magnitude to those across active plate boundaries, and are consistent with known active faults within the region. These results have significant implications for the definition of seismic hazard and for processes that drive intraplate seismicity.

Title:The role of prolactin and testosterone in mediating seasonal differences in the self-grooming behavior of male meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus.
Authors:['Leonard ST', 'Alizadeh-Naderi R', 'Stokes K', 'Ferkin MH']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Department of Biology, Ellington Hall, Memphis, TN 38152-6080, USA.
Abstract:Self-grooming in response to the odors of conspecifics is a form of olfactory communication among meadow voles. The amount of time meadow voles spend self-grooming when they encounter the odors of conspecifics varies seasonally, with males targeting the odors of reproductively active females only during the breeding season. Other odor related behaviors in male voles such as odor preferences for conspecifics and the attractiveness of their odors to conspecifics vary seasonally as well. For male meadow voles, these behaviors are mediated by seasonal variations in testosterone (T) and prolactin (PRL) titers. The objective of this study was to determine whether seasonal differences in the amount of time male meadow voles self-groom in response to odors of conspecifics are mediated by seasonal rhythms in their circulating T and PRL titers. We tested the hypothesis that high titers of both T and PRL are necessary for reproductively active (long-photoperiod; LP) males and sufficient for reproductively quiescent (short-photoperiod; SP) male voles to spend more time self-grooming in response to odors of LP females than to those of other conspecifics. Results of this study demonstrate that high titers of PRL and T are necessary for LP male meadow vole to self-groom more in response to odors of LP females as compared to those of other conspecifics, but were not sufficient to induce SP males to preferentially self-groom to odors of LP females. The endocrine control of self-grooming by LP males appears to depend upon high titers of both PRL and T, which matches the endocrine mediation of other odor related behaviors in male voles. In contrast, the endocrine tissues that underlie self-grooming in SP male meadow voles appear to be refractory to the effects of LP-equivalent titers of PRL and T.

Title:Botrocetin/VWF-induced signaling through GPIb-IX-V produces TxA2 in an alphaIIbbeta3- and aggregation-independent manner.
Authors:['Liu J', 'Pestina TI', 'Berndt MC', 'Jackson CW', 'Gartner TK']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to the platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex initiates a signaling cascade that causes alphaIIbbeta3 activation and platelet aggregation. Previous work demonstrated that botrocetin (bt)/VWF-mediated agglutination activates alphaIIbbeta3 and elicits adenosine triphosphate (ATP) secretion in a thromboxane A2 (TxA2)- and Ca2+-dependent manner. This agglutination-elicited TxA2 production occurs in the absence of ATP secretion. However, the signaling components and signaling network or pathway activated by GPIb-mediated agglutination to cause TxA2 production have not been identified. Therefore, the focus of this study was to elucidate at least part of the signal transduction network or pathway activated by GPIb-mediated agglutination to cause TxA2 production. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) selective inhibitor wortmannin, and mouse platelets deficient in Lyn, Src, Syk, Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing leukocyte protein 76 (SLP-76), phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2), linker for activation of T cells (LAT), or Fc receptor gamma-chain (FcRgamma-chain) were used for these studies. LAT and FcRgamma-chain were found not to be required for agglutination-driven TxA2 production or activation of alphaIIbbeta3, but were required for granule secretion and aggregation. The results also clearly demonstrate that bt/VWF-mediated agglutination-induced TxA2 production is dependent on signaling apparently initiated by Lyn, enhanced by Src, and propagated through Syk, SLP-76, PI3K, PLCgamma2, and protein kinase C (PKC).

Abstract:The goal of cancer gene therapy is the selective and efficient eradication of tumor cells without significant systemic toxicity. Although several different gene therapy approaches have been developed and tested both in preclinical and clinical trials, none of these methods are suitable for the safe and efficient treatment of cancer. Recent advances in tumor cell biology have accelerated the identification of novel proteins as targets for gene transfer strategies. However, the development of vectors and delivery systems for specific and efficient gene therapy has not kept pace with these discoveries. Below, we describe the most widely used gene therapy approaches and discuss the caveats of using these techniques in the clinic.

Title:Using the derived auditory brain stem response to estimate traveling wave velocity.
Authors:['Gould HJ', 'Sobhy OA']
Affiliation:Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:An estimate of the traveling wave velocity (TWV) was evaluated in 18 young adults to determine the technique's applicability as a possible tool in evaluating Meniere's disease. This TWV estimation uses a derived auditory brain stem response procedure requiring high-intensity masking. The results indicate that on average, TWVs were similar to those obtained via psychophysical measures or electrocochleography. However, instances of undermasking, due to subjects' intolerance, resulted in a number of subjects exhibiting faster than expected TWVs.

Title:ANG II-induced neointimal growth is mediated via cPLA2- and PLD2-activated Akt in balloon-injured rat carotid artery.

Abstract:Angiotensin II (ANG II) promotes neointimal growth in the balloon-injured rat carotid artery. However, the mechanism by which ANG II stimulates neointimal growth during vascular injury is not known. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, ANG II activates Akt through cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2)-dependent phospholipase D2 (PLD2). This study was conducted to determine whether ANG II-induced neointimal thickening is mediated via cPLA2- and PLD2-activated Akt in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. ANG II-stimulated neointimal growth was inhibited by exposure of the injured carotid arteries to an adenovirus containing a dominant negative Akt mutant (intima-to-media ratio from 3.01 +/- 0.31 to 1.44 +/- 0.14, P < 0.01) or a retrovirus containing cPLA2 small interfering RNA (siRNA; intima-to-media ratio from 3.01 +/- 0.31 to 1.16 +/- 0.36, P < 0.001) or PLD2 siRNA (intima-to-media ratio from 3.01 +/- 0.31 to 1.33 +/- 0.11, P < 0.001). The effect of cPLA2 and PLD2 siRNA to reduce the ANG II-induced increase in neointimal thickening was associated with reduced expression of cPLA2 and PLD2 as determined by immunohistochemical analysis in injured carotid arteries. Western blot analysis showed that Akt phosphorylation that was increased by ANG II was inhibited in injured carotid arteries 2 days after exposure to cPLA2 or PLD2 siRNA or in injured arteries isolated after exposure to these agents for 30 min and then placed in tissue culture media for 24 h in the presence of these agents. These data suggest that the ANG II-induced neointimal growth is mediated by the activation of Akt through a mechanism dependent on cPLA2 and PLD2 activation in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries.

Abstract:Wild waterfowl, including ducks, are natural hosts of influenza A viruses. These viruses rarely caused disease in ducks until 2002, when some H5N1 strains became highly pathogenic. Here we show that these H5N1 viruses are reverting to nonpathogenicity in ducks. Ducks experimentally infected with viruses isolated between 2003 and 2004 shed virus for an extended time (up to 17 days), during which variant viruses with low pathogenicity were selected. These results suggest that the duck has become the "Trojan horse" of Asian H5N1 influenza viruses. The ducks that are unaffected by infection with these viruses continue to circulate these viruses, presenting a pandemic threat.

Abstract:Children of women who smoked during pregnancy are at increased risk of dependence when smoking is initiated during adolescence. We previously reported that gestational nicotine exposure attenuated dopamine release induced by nicotine delivered during adolescence. In this study, we determined the effects of gestational nicotine exposure on nicotinic cholinergic receptor (nAChR) expression. Timed pregnant rats received nicotine (2 mg/kg/day) or vehicle via mini-osmotic pumps during gestation. Treatments continued in pups via maternal nursing during postnatal days (PN) 2-14 (equivalent to the human in utero third trimester). On PN35, 125I-epibatidine binding to nAChR was measured. The Bmax values (fmol/mg) in prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAcc), substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) were reduced by 26.6% (P<0.05), 32.6% (P<0.01), 23.0% (P<0.01) and 27.6% (P<0.05), respectively. In addition, gender differences were found in vehicle-treated groups; in SN and VTA, females were 79.3% (P<0.005) and 82.9% (P=0.08) of males, respectively. The expression of nAChR subunit mRNAs was measured using real-time RT-PCR on laser-capture microdissected tissues. In adolescent VTA, gestational nicotine exposure reduced (P<0.05) nAChR subunit mRNAs encoding alpha3 (53.0%), alpha4 (23.9%), alpha5 (46.7%) and beta4 (61.4%). In NAcc core, the treatment increased alpha3 mRNA (75.8%). In addition, the number of neurons in VTA was reduced by 15.0% (P<0.001). These studies indicate that gestational exposure to nicotine induces long-lasting changes in nAChR expression that may underlie the vulnerability of adolescents to dependence on nicotine.

Title:Statistical analysis of fractal-based brain tumor detection algorithms.
Authors:['Zook JM', 'Iftekharuddin KM']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN 38152-3810, USA.
Abstract:Fractals are geometric objects that have a noninteger fractal dimension (FD). The FD has been exploited for various biomedical recognition applications such as breast tumor and lung tumor detection. Our previous work shows that the FD is useful in the detection of brain tumors when a reference nontumor image is available. In this work, we extend our previous work by statistically validating the results of FD analysis on a set of 80 real MR and CT images. Our half-image technique requires that the tumor is located in one half of the brain whereas our whole-image technique does not. Furthermore, we alleviate the need for a reference (control) nontumor image to compute the tumor FD, which was necessary in our previous work. We also compare the brain tumor detection performance of our algorithms with other fractal-based algorithms in the literature and statistically validate our results against manually segmented tumor images. We find that the tumor region offers a statistically significant lower FD compared with that of the nontumor area for most of the FD algorithms studied in this work. Thus, our statistical analysis suggests that these FD algorithms may be exploited successfully to determine the possible presence and location of brain tumors in MR and CT images.

Abstract:The relationship between hyperlipidemia and sensorineural hearing loss remains obscure. In this study, we elucidate for the first time the cochlear morphological and auditory alterations and their relationships with hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and endothelial dysfunction in apolipoprotein-E knockout (ApoE-KO) mice. Ten-week-old ApoE-KO mice were fed either atherosclerotic diet (1.25% cholesterol) or normal diet. Wild type mice (C57BL/6J) served as normal controls. Fourteen weeks later, marked hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and hearing impairment, especially in the high frequencies, had developed in ApoE-KO mice as compared with C57BL/6J mice (P<0.001). A high positive correlation between hearing loss and the extent of atherosclerosis and plasma total cholesterol levels was found. Hearing loss, especially at high frequencies, was detected in all ApoE-KO mice. Hair cell loss mainly at the base turn, thickening of vascular intima, and lumen stenosis of the spiral modiolar artery (SMA) in cochlea were also found; these histological changes were exacerbated by the atherosclerotic diet. Furthermore, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in aortic wall and cochlea was distinctly reduced in ApoE-KO mice. These results demonstrate that hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis can induce alterations in cochlear morphology and function. The stenosis of SMA, which may cause cochlear ischemia and hypoxia, endothelial dysfunction, and low eNOS activity, may contribute to hearing loss.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to examine the spatial and population (e.g., socio-economic) characteristics of low birthweight using two different cluster estimation techniques. We compared the results of Kulldorff's Spatial Scan Statistic with the results of Rushton's Spatial filtering technique across increasing sizes of spatial filters (circle). We were able to demonstrate that varying approaches exist to explore spatial variation in patterns of low birth weight. RESULTS: Spatial filtering results did not show any particular area that was not statistically significant based on SaTScan. The high rates, which remain as the filter size increases to 0.4, 0.5 to 0.6 miles, respectively, indicate that these differences are less likely due to chance. The maternal characteristics of births within clusters differed considerably between the two methods. Progressively larger Spatial filters removed local spatial variability, which eventually produced an approximate uniform pattern of low birth weight. CONCLUSION: SaTScan and Spatial filtering cluster estimation methods produced noticeably different results from the same individual level birth data. SaTScan clusters are likely to differ from Spatial filtering clusters in terms of population characteristics and geographic area within clusters. Using the two methods in conjunction could provide more detail about the population and spatial features contained with each type of cluster.

Abstract:Acoustic emission (AE) was used to monitor the progress of the fatigue damage process in the cement mantles of two cemented femur stem constructs that contained naturally occurring defects. After the fatigue tests, morphological features of the defects were investigated using an environmental scanning electron microscope. It showed that the regions with no visible defects were mainly microcrack free, whereas the defect regions were the main sources generating microcracks. Two types of microcracks were identified: type I and type II. Signal energies associated with type I microcracks were about an order of magnitude higher than that of type II. The microstructural investigations of the defects and the areas in the vicinity of the defects suggested their categorization into stable and unstable. The accumulative energy-time relationships revealed that stable and unstable microcrack curves had convex [formula: see text], and concave [formula: see text] shapes, respectively. The progress of fatigue microcrack formation occurred over three distinct phases: initiation, transition, and stableness.

Title:Spectral amplitude measures of adductor spasmodic dysphonic speech.
Authors:['Cannito MP', 'Buder EH', 'Chorna LB']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, TN 38105, USA. mcannito@memphis.edu
Abstract:Spectral amplitude measures are sensitive to varying degrees of vocal fold adduction in normal speakers. This study examined the applicability of harmonic amplitude differences to adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD) in comparison with normal controls. Amplitudes of the first and second harmonics (H1, H2) and of harmonics affiliated with the first, second, and third formants (A1, A2, A3) were obtained from spectra of vowels and /i/ excerpted from connected speech. Results indicated that these measures could be made reliably in ADSD. With the exception of H1(*)-H2(*), harmonic amplitude differences (H1(*)-A1, H1(*)-A2, and H1(*)-A3(*)) exhibited significant negative linear relationships (P < 0.05) with clinical judgments of overall severity. The four harmonic amplitude differences significantly differentiated between pre-BT and post-BT productions (P < 0.05). After treatment, measurements from detected significant differences between ADSD and normal controls (P < 0.05), but measurements from /i/ did not. LTAS analysis of ADSD patients' speech samples proved a good fit with harmonic amplitude difference measures. Harmonic amplitude differences also significantly correlated with perceptual judgments of breathiness and roughness (P < 0.05). These findings demonstrate high clinical applicability for harmonic amplitude differences for characterizing phonation in the speech of persons with ADSD, as well as normal speakers, and they suggest promise for future application to other voice pathologies.

Abstract:Wild waterfowl are the natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses, and these viruses are usually nonpathogenic in these birds. However, since late 2002, H5N1 outbreaks in Asia have resulted in mortality among waterfowl in recreational parks, domestic flocks, and wild migratory birds. The evolutionary stasis between influenza virus and its natural host may have been disrupted, prompting us to ask whether waterfowl are resistant to H5N1 influenza virus disease and whether they can still act as a reservoir for these viruses. To better understand the biology of H5N1 viruses in ducks and attempt to answer this question, we inoculated juvenile mallards with 23 different H5N1 influenza viruses isolated in Asia between 2003 and 2004. All virus isolates replicated efficiently in inoculated ducks, and 22 were transmitted to susceptible contacts. Viruses replicated to higher levels in the trachea than in the cloaca of both inoculated and contact birds, suggesting that the digestive tract is not the main site of H5N1 influenza virus replication in ducks and that the fecal-oral route may no longer be the main transmission path. The virus isolates' pathogenicities varied from completely nonpathogenic to highly lethal and were positively correlated with tracheal virus titers. Nevertheless, the eight virus isolates that were nonpathogenic in ducks replicated and transmitted efficiently to naive contacts, suggesting that highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses causing minimal signs of disease in ducks can propagate silently and efficiently among domestic and wild ducks in Asia and that they represent a serious threat to human and veterinary public health.

Title:Inhibition of carboxylesterases by benzil (diphenylethane-1,2-dione) and heterocyclic analogues is dependent upon the aromaticity of the ring and the flexibility of the dione moiety.

Abstract:Benzil has been identified as a potent selective inhibitor of carboxylesterases (CEs). Essential components of the molecule required for inhibitory activity include the dione moiety and the benzene rings, and substitution within the rings affords increased selectivity toward CEs from different species. Replacement of the benzene rings with heterocyclic substituents increased the K(i) values for the compounds toward three mammalian CEs when using o-nitrophenyl acetate as a substrate. Logarithmic plots of the K(i) values versus the empirical resonance energy, the heat of union of formation energy, or the aromatic stabilization energy determined from molecular orbital calculations for the ring structures yielded linear relationships that allowed prediction of the efficacy of the diones toward CE inhibition. Using these data, we predicted that 2,2'-naphthil would be an excellent inhibitor of mammalian CEs. This was demonstrated to be correct with a K(i) value of 1 nM being observed for a rabbit liver CE. In addition, molecular simulations of the movement of the ring structures around the dione dihedral indicated that the ability of the compounds to inhibit CEs was due, in part, to rotational constraints enforced by the dione moiety. Overall, these studies identify subdomains within the aromatic ethane-1,2-diones, that are responsible for CE inhibition.

Abstract:A mannose-binding C-type lectin (MBL) was isolated by affinity chromatography from Heliothis virescens immune pupal hemolymph. The immune pupal hemolymph was obtained after bacterial injection of live Enterobacter cloacae bacteria. MBL in mammals acts as an opsonin for phagocytosis and activates the lectin complement pathway of the innate immune response, which leads to killing of gram-negative bacteria and enveloped viruses. The affinity-purified and reduced pupal MBL showed a single band of 36 kDa by SDS-PAGE (12% gel). A dot-immunoblot ELISA (using guinea pig anti-MBL IgG as primary antibody) demonstrated specificity of the antibody for the affinity-purified pupal MBL. The immune pupal hemolymph contained 21 microg of MBL per ml of hemolymph. The amino acid composition of the purified pupal MBL was determined with high amounts of arginine and histidine detected. The presence of MBL in insect pupae has not before been reported and could be important in pupal innate immunity to bacterial infection.

Title:The drinking situations of adolescents treated for alcohol use disorders: a psychometric and alcohol-related outcomes investigation.

Abstract:Psychometric properties of the Inventory of Drinking Situations (IDS) were examined using a sample of adolescents with Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs; N = 352; mean age=16.6; 65.6% boys). Relations of drinking situations to alcohol-related outcomes 1 and 3 years following treatment also were investigated. Consistent with the higher-order structure of the IDS reported in adult samples, findings indicated that a 3 factor solution provided the best fit to the data: Negative (alpha = .98), Social (alpha = .95), and Temptation (alpha = .84) Situations. With regard to convergent and discriminate validity, evidence suggested that the Negative Situations subscale was related more strongly to an indicator of negative emotionality than to an indicator behavioral undercontrol. Conversely, the Social Situations subscale was associated more strongly with an indicator of behavioral undercontrol than an indicator of negative emotionality. Social and temptation drinking situations were associated with alcohol-related outcomes 1 year following treatment, but this was generally not the case 3 years following treatment. These results indicate that the IDS is a reliable and valid measure for use with adolescents receiving treatment for alcohol-related problems.

Title:Comparison of tRNA motions in the free and ribosomal bound structures.
Authors:['Wang Y', 'Jernigan RL']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-3550, USA.
Abstract:A general method is presented that allows the separation of the rigid body motions from the nonrigid body motions of structural subunits when bound in a complex. The application presented considers the motions of the tRNAs: free, bound to the ribosome and to a synthase. We observe that both the rigid body and nonrigid body motions of the structural subunits are highly controlled by the large ribosomal assembly and are important for the functional motions of the assembly. For the intact ribosome, its major parts, the 30S and the 50S subunits, are found to have counterrotational motions in the first few slowest modes, which are consistent with the experimentally observed ratchet motion. The tRNAs are found to have on average approximately 72-75% rigid body motions and principally translational motions within the first 100 slow modes of the complex. Although the three tRNAs exhibit different apparent total motions, after the rigid body motions are removed, the remaining internal motions of all three tRNAs are essentially the same. The direction of the translational motions of the tRNAs are in the same direction as the requisite translocation step, especially in the first slowest mode. Surprisingly the small intrinsically flexible mRNA has all of its internal motions completely inhibited and shows mainly a rigid-body translation in the slow modes of the ribosome complex. On the other hand, the required nonrigid body motions of the tRNA during translocation reveal that the anticodon-stem-loop, as well as the acceptor arm, of the tRNA enjoy a large mobility but act as rigid structural units. In summary, the ribosome exerts its control by enforcing rigidity in the functional parts of the tRNAs as well as in the mRNA.

Title:Prox1 activity controls pancreas morphogenesis and participates in the production of "secondary transition" pancreatic endocrine cells.

Abstract:The development of the mammalian pancreas is governed by various signaling processes and by a cascade of gene activation events controlled by different transcription factors. Here we show that the divergent homeodomain transcription factor Prox1 is a novel, crucial regulator of mouse pancreas organogenesis. Loss of Prox1 function severely disrupted epithelial pancreas morphology and hindered pancreatic growth without affecting significantly the genesis of endocrine cells before E11.5. Conversely, the lack of Prox1 activity substantially decreased the formation of islet cell precursors after E13.5, during a period known as the "secondary transition". Notably, this defect occurred concurrently with an abnormal increment of exocrine cells. Hence, it is possible that Prox1 contributes to the allocation of an adequate supply of islet cells throughout pancreas ontogeny by preventing exocrine cell differentiation of multipotent pancreatic progenitors. Prox1 thus appears to be an essential component of a genetic program destined to produce the cellular complexity of the mammalian pancreas.

Abstract:Organosilane sol-gels have been prepared under different conditions from mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) and mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane (MPTES). These sol-gels were applied for the thin film coating on aluminum. Vibrational spectroscopy has been employed to trace and to study the proceeding of the sol-gel formation and the curing of the coated films on Al. Based on the group frequencies as well as their spectral behavior under different conditions, vibrational assignments have been made for most of the observed bands. Surface enhanced Raman scattering has revealed the chemical adsorption of MPTMS sol-gel on silver particles. Recorded reflection and absorption infrared (RAIR) spectra of coated tiles cured at different temperatures have indicated that surface reaction may occur at high temperature. The anticorrosion characters of the coated metals have been evaluated with the measured electrochemical data. Results from cyclic voltammographs have indicated that each layer of sol-gel coating would reduce the redox current across the electrode/electrolyte solution interface. Tafel plots have shown that the anodic current of the coated electrode decreases significantly and the corrosion potentials shift to the positive side.

Title:A new, reliable, and simple-to-use method for the analysis of a population of values of a random variable using the Weibull probability distribution: application to acrylic bone cement fatigue results.
Authors:['Janna S', 'Dwiggins DP', 'Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN 38152-3180, USA.
Abstract:In cases where the Weibull probability distribution is being investigated as a possible fit to experimentally obtained results of a random variable (V), there is, currently, no accurate and reliable but simple-to-use method available for simultaneously (a) establishing if the fit is of the two- or three-parameter variant of the distribution, and/or (b) estimating the minimum value of the variable (V(0)), in cases where the three-parameter variant is shown to be applicable. In the present work, the details of such a method -- which uses a simple nonlinear regression analysis -- are presented, together with results of its use when applied to 4 sets of number-of-cycles-to-fracture results from fatigue tests, performed in our laboratory, using specimens fabricated from 3 different acrylic bone cement formulations. The key result of the method is that the two- or three-parameter variant of the probability distribution is applicable if the estimate of V(0) obtained is less than or greater than zero, respectively.

Title:Injectable bone cements for use in vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty: state-of-the-art review.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, 312 Engineering Science Building, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. G.Lewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:Vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) are minimally invasive surgical procedures that have recently been introduced for the medical management of osteoporosis-induced vertebral compression fractures. The aim of VP is to stabilize the fractured vertebral body, while the goals of KP are to stabilize the fractured vertebral body and to restore its height to as near its prefracture level as possible. Both procedures involve injection of the setting dough of an injectable bone cement (IBC) into the fractured vertebral body, thereby highlighting the indispensable role that the IBC plays. Although there is a very large literature on IBCs, no detailed critical review of it has been published. Such a review is the subject of the present work, which is in seven parts. The review opens with a succinct introduction to VP and KP. The topics covered in the parts that follow are: (1) a listing of the 18 most desirable properties of an IBC (e.g., easy injectability, high radiopacity, and a resorption rate that is neither too high nor too low); (2) descriptions of the four classes of IBCs (calcium phosphates, acrylic bone cements, calcium sulfates, and composites); (3) concerns that have been raised with regard to the use of IBCs (such as the potential for thermal necrosis of tissue at the peri-augmentation site, when an acrylic bone cement is used); (4) explicative summaries of the main findings of literature studies on the influence of nine factors (such as powder particle size, powder-to-liquid ratio, and the method used to mix the powder and the liquid) on the values of various properties of IBCs; (5) explicative summaries of the main findings of literature studies on five fundamental matters, such as the aging mechanism of the powder, the thermokinetics of a setting dough, and the influence of the type of IBC used on various ex vivo biomechanical performance measures of VP- and KP-augmented vertebral bodies; and (6) descriptions of topics in six areas for future research, such as the determination of an overall index of the fatigue performance of an IBC and the development of internationally recognized standardized testing protocols to employ when a synthetic cancellous bone void model is used in the rapid in vitro screening of IBCs. The review ends with a summary of the most salient points and observations made.

Title:Cloning and expression of the cryIVD gene of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis in the cyanobacterium Agmenellum quadruplicatum PR-6 and its resulting larvicidal activity.
Authors:['Murphy RC', 'Stevens SE Jr']

Abstract:A mosquitocidal cyanobacterium has been developed by introducing the mosquito-toxic cryIVD gene from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis into the unicellular cyanobacterium Agmenellum quadruplicatum PR-6 (Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002). The cryIVD gene was introduced into the cyanobacterium on a derivative of the PR-6 expression vector pAQE19 delta Sal in which the cryIVD gene was translationally fused to the initial coding sequence of the highly expressed PR-6 cpcB gene. Coomassie blue staining and immunoblot analysis of gel-fractionated cell extract polypeptides indicate that the cpcB-cryIVD gene fusion is expressed at high levels in the cyanobacterial cells, with little or no apparent degradation of the cryIVD gene product. Larvicidal assays revealed that freshly hatched Culex pipiens mosquito larvae readily ingested the transformed cyanobacteria and that the cells proved to be toxic to the larvae.

Abstract:The bassoon is a demanding double-reed woodwind instrument requiring exquisite control of airflow and air pressure to the reed to produce desired tonal characteristics. Little information is available from direct visualization of the vocal tract and larynx of the bassoonist while playing. Of particular interest is the mechanism(s) of vibrato. This study was undertaken to understand more fully the mechanics of the upper airway in bassoonists during music production. Four adult bassoon players served as subjects. Three players were studied with both sound-synchronized videofluoroscopy and fiber-optic nasal endoscopy. The other subject was studied only by fiber-optic endoscopy. All subjects were evaluated while playing various scales and standard passages common in music pedagogy. The results from this study revealed several findings on the mechanics of upper airway activity during playing: (1) firm velopharyngeal closure was a prerequisite for maximal containment of air pressure and regulation of airflow in the oropharyngeal regions; (2) changes in the pitch and intensity were associated with differential expansion of the pharynx; (3) tongue activity was notable because of its shaping the size and shape of the airway, its role in regulating airflow to the reed, and its contributions to conditioning airflow in vibrato; and (4) slight vocal fold displacements from subglottal airflow and epiglottic movements from tongue base activity contributed to airway changes during vibrato. These seemed to further condition subglottal pressure trains derived primarily from expiration.

Abstract:Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the physiological role of APP and its family members is still unclear. To gain insights into APP function, we used a proteomic approach to identify APP interacting proteins. We report here for the first time a direct interaction between the C-terminal region of APP family proteins and ubiquitous mitochondrial creatine kinase (uMtCK). This interaction was confirmed in vitro as well as in cultured cells and in brain. Interestingly, expression of full-length and C-terminal domain of APP family proteins stabilized uMtCK preprotein in cultured cells. Our data suggest that APP may regulate cellular energy levels and mitochondrial function via a direct interaction and stabilization of uMtCK.

Abstract:Short-chain phosphatidic acid derivatives, dioctanoyl glycerol pyrophosphate (DGPP 8:0, 1) and phosphatidic acid 8:0 (PA 8:0, 2), were previously identified as subtype-selective LPA(1) and LPA(3) receptor antagonists. Recently, we reported that the replacement of the phosphate headgroup by thiophosphate in a series of fatty alcohol phosphates (FAP) improves agonist as well as antagonist activities at LPA GPCR. Here, we report the synthesis of stereoisomers of PA 8:0 analogs and their biological evaluation at LPA GPCR, PPARgamma, and ATX. The results indicate that LPA receptors stereoselectively interact with glycerol backbone modified ligands. We observed entirely stereospecific responses by dioctyl PA 8:0 compounds, in which (R)-isomers were found to be agonists and (S)-isomers were antagonists of LPA GPCR. From this series, we identified compound 13b as the most potent LPA(3) receptor subtype-selective agonist (EC(50)=3 nM), and 8b as a potent and selective LPA(3) receptor antagonist (K(i)=5 nM) and inhibitor of ATX (IC(50)=600 nM). Serinediamide phosphate 19b was identified as an LPA(3) receptor specific antagonist with no effect on LPA(1), LPA(2), and PPARgamma.

Abstract:This paper describes an efficient NMR strategy for assigning the backbone resonances of an intrinsically unstructured protein (IUP), p21-KID, bound to its biological target, Cdk2/cyclin A. In order to overcome the challenges associated with the high molecular weight (75 kDa) and low solubility of the ternary complex (0.2 mM), we used perdeuteration, TROSY, and high-sensitivity cryogenic NMR probes at high magnetic-field strengths (i.e. 16.4, 18.8 and 21.1 Tesla). p21-KID was also prepared by using specific amino acid isotope labels. Most importantly, we studied binary, subcomplexes that allowed resonance assignments to be made in stages. We show that subdomains of p21-KID folded within binary complexes into the same conformations as observed in the ternary, Cdk2/cyclin A complex. This is a general feature of IUPs, which often adopt highly extended conformations when bound to other proteins. This strategy is suitable for studies of IUPs within considerably larger biomolecular assemblies as long as the IUP can be uniformly and selectively isotope labeled.

Title:Modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission by endogenous glutamate acting on presynaptic group II mGluRs in rat substantia nigra compacta.

Abstract:Excitatory synaptic inputs from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) have been proposed to underlie burst firing of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine (DA) neurons in Parkinson's disease. Given the potential importance of the STN-SNc synapse in health and disease, our goal was to study how transmission at this synapse is regulated. We tested the hypothesis that neurotransmission at STN-SNc synapses is tonically inhibited by endogenous glutamate acting on presynaptic group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). By using whole-cell recording techniques in brain slices, we examined the effect of LY341495, a mGluR antagonist that is most potent at group II mGluRs, on excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) that either were evoked in SNc DA neurons by stimulation of the STN or were spontaneously occurred in the presence of tetrodotoxin (miniature EPSCs; mEPSCs). LY341495 increased the evoked EPSC amplitude and mEPSC frequency without changing mEPSC amplitude. In contrast, the group III mGluR antagonist UBP1112 failed to increase the evoked EPSC amplitude. An elevation of extracellular glutamate concentration by a glutamate transporter inhibitor, TBOA, suppressed the evoked EPSCs. LY341495, but not UBP1112, partially reversed the TBOA action. The modulations of EPSCs by TBOA and LY341495 were associated with changes in paired-pulse facilitation ratio. Furthermore, TBOA decreased mEPSC frequency, which was partially reversed by LY341495, without affecting mEPSC amplitude. The results indicate that presynaptic group II mGluRs at STN-SNc synapses appear to be partially activated by a basal level of extracellular glutamate and able to sense the change in extracellular glutamate concentration, subsequently modulating synaptic glutamate release.

Abstract:This investigation was designed to determine the effects of astaxanthin on markers of skeletal muscle injury. Twenty resistance trained men (mean +/- standard error of the mean : age , 25.1 +/- 1.6 y; height, 1.79 +/- 0.02 m; weight, 86.8 +/- 4.4 kg) were assigned to either a placebo (1732 mg safflower oil, n =10) or astaxanthin (BioAstin; 1732 mg safflower oil; haematococcus algae extract [contains 4 mg astaxanthin and 480 mg lutein]n = 10). Subjects consumed their assigned treatment for 3 wk prior to eccentric exercise (10 sets of 10 repetitions at 85% of one repetition maximum) and through 96 h post-exercise. Muscle soreness, creatine kinase (CK), and muscle performance was measured before and through 96 h post-exercise. A similar response was observed for both treatment groups for all dependent variables, indicating that in resistance trained men, astaxanthin supplementation does not favorably affect indirect markers of skeletal muscle injury following eccentric loading.

Title:Energy cost of moderate-duration resistance and aerobic exercise.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Department of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu
Abstract:The purpose of this study was to compare energy expenditure of resistance and aerobic exercise matched for total time and relative intensity. Ten trained men (24.3 +/- 3.8 years) performed 30 minutes of intermittent free-weight squatting at 70% of 1 repetition maximum and continuous cycling at 70% of Vo(2)max, in a crossover design. Vo(2), kilocalories (kcal), work, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), V(E), heart rate (HR), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) data were recorded. Cycling resulted in greater total Vo(2) (87 +/- 3 vs. 53 +/- 3 L, mean +/- SEM), kcal expenditure (441 +/- 17 vs. 269 +/- 13), and work (335 +/- 11 vs. 128 +/- 11 kJ) than squatting did. The mean RER was greater during squatting (1.03 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.01), and the V(E) values were greater during cycling (82 +/- 3 vs. 70 +/- 3 L.min(-1)). The HR response was nearly identical between exercise modes (160 +/- 5 vs. 160 +/- 4 bpm), whereas the RPE was greater during squatting (16.96 +/- 0.41 vs. 14.88 +/- 0.42). These data suggest that although lower than similarly matched aerobic exercise, resistance exercise resulted in an energy cost that would meet the recommendations for kcal expenditure as suggested by the American College of Sports Medicine, if performed 4-5 days per week. These findings should be considered by coaches and trainers working with individuals mutually interested in muscular development and weight management, because programs of structured resistance exercise may assist with both.

Abstract:Darmstoff describes a family of gut smooth muscle-stimulating acetal phosphatidic acids initially isolated and characterized from the bath fluid of stimulated gut over 50 years ago. Despite similar structural and biological profiles, Darmstoff analogs have not previously been examined as potential LPA mimetics. Here, we report a facile method for the synthesis of potassium salts of Darmstoff analogs. To understand the effect of stereochemistry on lysophosphatidic acid mimetic activity, synthesis of optically pure stereoisomers of selected Darmstoff analogs was achieved starting with chiral methyl glycerates. Each Darmstoff analog was evaluated for subtype-specific LPA receptor agonist/antagonist activity, PPARgamma activation, and autotaxin inhibition. From this study we identified compound 12 as a pan-antagonist and several pan-agonists for the LPA(1-3) receptors. Introduction of an aromatic ring in the lipid chain such as analog 22 produced a subtype-specific LPA(3) agonist with an EC(50) of 692 nM. Interestingly, regardless of their LPA(1/2/3) ligand properties all of the Darmstoff analogs tested activated PPARgamma. However, these compounds are weak inhibitors of autotaxin. The results indicate that Darmstoff analogs constitute a novel class of lysophosphatidic acid mimetics.

Title:Evidence-based practice in provision of amplification.
Authors:['Cox RM']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, TN, USA. robyncox@memphis.edu
Abstract:Evidence-based practice (EBP) has been widely embraced in many health-care fields as a way of maintaining currency of knowledge and state-of-the-art treatment recommendations in an age of information abundance and rapid scientific progress. Although the principles of EBP are slowly entering the specialties of communication disorders, they are not well known or extensively employed as yet. In this article, the rationale for EBP is presented and differences between EBP and traditional practice are highlighted. The five-step process of EBP is described: defining the problem, searching for evidence, critically appraising the evidence, formulating a recommendation, and assessing the outcome. Critical appraisal calls for determination of the validity, clinical significance, and applicability of evidence. Each of these topics is explored with emphasis placed on the application of EBP to hearing rehabilitation. Finally some suggestions are offered for researchers and practitioners to facilitate a transition to EBP in amplification provision.

Title:Identification of a specific inhibitor of the dishevelled PDZ domain.

Abstract:The Wnt signaling pathways are involved in embryo development as well as in tumorigenesis. Dishevelled (Dvl) transduces Wnt signals from the receptor Frizzled (Fz) to downstream components in canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways. The Dvl PDZ domain is thought to play an essential role in both pathways, and we recently demonstrated that the Dvl PDZ domain binds directly to Fz receptors. In this study, using structure-based virtual ligand screening, we identified an organic molecule (NSC668036) from the National Cancer Institute small-molecule library that can bind to the Dvl PDZ domain. We then used molecular dynamics simulation to analyze the binding between the PDZ domain and NSC668036 in detail. In addition, we showed that, in Xenopus, as expected, NSC668036 inhibited the signaling induced by Wnt3A. This compound provides a basis for rational design of high-affinity inhibitors of the PDZ domain, which can block Wnt signaling by interrupting the Fz-Dvl interaction.

Title:Identification of novel transcriptional networks in response to treatment with the anticarcinogen 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione.

Abstract:3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T), an inducer of antioxidant and phase 2 genes, is known to enhance the detoxification of environmental carcinogens, prevent neoplasia, and elicit other protective effects. However, a comprehensive view of the regulatory pathways induced by this compound has not yet been elaborated. Fischer F344 rats were gavaged daily for 5 days with vehicle or D3T (0.3 mmol/kg). The global changes of gene expression in liver were measured with Affymetrix RG-U34A chips. With the use of functional class scoring, a semi-supervised method exploring both the expression pattern and the functional annotation of the genes, the Gene Ontology classes were ranked according to the significance of the impact of D3T treatment. Two unexpected functional classes were identified for the D3T treatment, cytosolic ribosome constituents with 90% of those genes increased, and cholesterol biosynthesis with 91% of the genes repressed. In another novel approach, the differentially expressed genes were evaluated by the Ingenuity computational pathway analysis tool to identify specific regulatory networks and canonical pathways responsive to D3T treatment. In addition to the known glutathione metabolism pathway (P = 0.0011), several other significant pathways were also revealed, including antigen presentation (P = 0.000476), androgen/estrogen biosynthesis (P = 0.000551), fatty acid (P = 0.000216), and tryptophan metabolism (P = 0.000331) pathways. These findings showed a profound impact of D3T on lipid metabolism and anti-inflammatory/immune-suppressive response, indicating a broader cytoprotective effect of this compound than previously expected.

Title:Different residues mediate recognition of 1-O-oleyllysophosphatidic acid and rosiglitazone in the ligand binding domain of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.

Abstract:Here we showed that a naturally occurring ether analog of lysophosphatidic acid, 1-O-octadecenyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (AGP), is a high affinity partial agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Binding studies using the PPARgamma ligand binding domain showed that [32P]AGP and [3H]rosiglitazone (Rosi) both specifically bind to PPARgamma and compete with each other. [32P]AGP bound PPARgamma with an affinity (Kdapp 60 nm) similar to that of Rosi. However, AGP displaced approximately 40% of bound [3H]Rosi even when applied at a 2000-fold excess. Activation of PPARgamma reporter gene expression by AGP and Rosi showed similar potency, yet AGP-mediated activation was approximately 40% that of Rosi. A complex between AGP and PPARgamma was generated using molecular modeling based on a PPARgamma crystal structure. AGP-interacting residues were compared with Rosi-interacting residues identified within the Rosi-PPARgamma co-crystal complex. These comparisons showed that the two ligands occupy partially overlapping positions but make different hydrogen bonding and ion pairing interactions. Site-specific mutants of PPARgamma were prepared to examine individual ligand binding. H323A and H449A mutants showed reduced binding of Rosi but maintained binding of AGP. In contrast, the R288A showed reduced AGP binding but maintained Rosi binding. Finally, alanine replacement of Tyr-473 abolished binding and activation by Rosi and AGP. These observations indicate that the endogenous lipid mediator AGP is a high affinity ligand of PPARgamma but that it binds via interactions distinct from those involved in Rosi binding. These distinct interactions are likely responsible for the partial PPARgamma agonism of AGP.

Abstract:Azotobacter vinelandii OP was grown to stationary phase in defined medium. The cell-free culture medium was analyzed for cytokinin content by XAD-2 and Sephadex LH-20 chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, tobacco callus bioassay, and enzyme immunoassay. Three cytokinin-active fractions were detected and tentatively identified as trans-zeatin, isopentenyladenosine, and isopentenyladenine. The total cytokinin activity was equivalent to 0.75 mug of kinetin per liter.

Abstract:A statistical relationship between the rate of ferric ion production by a strain of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and various levels of cell concentration, Fe concentration, Na concentration, and temperature was studied by a direct colorimetric method at 304 nm. The relationship was linear (90 to 93%), cross-product (3 to 4%), and quadratic (1 to 2%). The levels of cell concentration and Fe concentration and their respective interactions with one another and the other factors had the most significant effects on the regression models. The solution of the quadratic response surface for optimum oxidation was a saddle point, and the predicted critical levels of temperature, cell concentration, Fe concentration, and Na concentration ranged between -6 and 2 degrees C, 0.43 and 0.62 mg/ml, 72 and 233 mM, and 29.6 mM, respectively.

Abstract:Genetic loci that regulate inherited traits are routinely identified using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping methods. However, the genotype-phenotype associations do not provide information on the gene expression program through which the genetic loci regulate the traits. Transcription modules are 'self-consistent regulatory units' and are closely related to the modular components of gene regulatory network [Ihmels, J., Friedlander, G., Bergmann, S., Sarig, O., Ziv, Y. and Barkai, N. (2002) Revealing modular organization in the yeast transcriptional network. Nat. Genet., 31, 370-377; Segal, E., Shapira, M., Regev, A., Pe'er, D., Botstein, D., Koller, D. and Friedman, N. (2003) Module networks: identifying regulatory modules and their condition-specific regulators from gene expression data. Nat. Genet., 34, 166-176]. We used genome-wide genotype and gene expression data of a genetic reference population that consists of mice of 32 recombinant inbred strains to identify the transcription modules and the genetic loci regulating them. Twenty-nine transcription modules defined by genetic variations were identified. Statistically significant associations between the transcription modules and 18 classical physiological and behavioral traits were found. Genome-wide interval mapping showed that major QTLs regulating the transcription modules are often co-localized with the QTLs regulating the associated classical traits. The association and the possible co-regulation of the classical trait and transcription module indicate that the transcription module may be involved in the gene pathways connecting the QTL and the classical trait. Our results show that a transcription module may associate with multiple seemingly unrelated classical traits and a classical trait may associate with different modules. Literature mining results provided strong independent evidences for the relations among genes of the transcription modules, genes in the regions of the QTLs regulating the transcription modules and the keywords representing the classical traits.

Abstract:Septicemia is a major cause of death associated with noncoronary intensive care. Systemic production of nitric oxide (NO) by inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) is a major cause of hypotension and poor organ perfusion seen in septic shock. Here, we show that pretreatment of F344 rats with the cancer chemoprotective agent 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) blocks lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated induction of hepatic iNOS and significantly reduces the associated serum levels of NO metabolites and enzyme markers of toxicity provoked by treatment with LPS. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that this protective effect is largely due to suppression of iNOS expression in hepatocytes. Importantly, pretreatment of animals with D3T blunts LPS-mediated hypotension and dramatically increases their survival. Inasmuch as iNOS expression can be regulated by nuclear factor (NF) kappaB, mechanistic studies show that D3T blocks NFkappaB nuclear translocation and DNA binding and that these effects are accompanied by changes in the levels of phospho-inhibitor of NFkappaB. In conclusion, this study identifies new drug classes and targets that may improve the prevention and treatment of septic shock, as well as chronic diseases associated with the NFkappaB and iNOS pathways.

Title:Counter-regulatory function of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B in platelet-derived growth factor- or fibroblast growth factor-induced motility and proliferation of cultured smooth muscle cells and in neointima formation.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: We have previously reported that vascular injury or treatment of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) or fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) increases the levels of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP)1B. The current study was designed to test the hypothesis that PTP1B attenuates PDGF- or FGF-induced motility and proliferation of cultured cells, as well as neointima formation in injured rat carotid arteries. METHODS AND RESULTS: Treatment of cultured cells with adenovirus expressing PTP1B decreased PDGF-BB- or FGF2-induced cell motility and blocked PDGF-BB- or FGF2-induced proliferation, whereas expression of dominant negative PTP1B (C215S-PTP1B) uncovered the motogenic effect of subthreshold levels of PDGF-BB or FGF2, increased neointimal and medial cell proliferation, and induced neointimal enlargement after balloon injury. The inhibitory effect of PTP1B directed against PDGF in cultured cells was associated with dephosphorylation of the PDGFbeta receptor. CONCLUSIONS: PTP1B suppresses cell proliferation and motility in cultured smooth muscle cells treated with PDGF-BB or FGF2, and the phosphatase plays a counter-regulatory role in vascular injury-induced cell proliferation and neointima formation. Taken together with previous studies indicating increased PTP1B levels in cells treated with growth factors, the current findings are the first to report the existence of an inhibitory feedback loop involving PDGF or FGF, and PTP1B in blood vessels.

Abstract:A systematic investigation of the phase-separation dynamics in self-assembled binary fluid vesicles and open membranes is presented. We use large-scale dissipative particle dynamics to explicitly account for solvent, thereby allowing for numerical investigation of the effects of hydrodynamics and area-to-volume constraints. In the case of asymmetric lipid composition, we observed regimes corresponding to coalescence of flat patches, budding, vesiculation, and coalescence of caps. The area-to-volume constraint and hydrodynamics have a strong influence on these regimes and the crossovers between them. In the case of symmetric mixtures, irrespective of the area-to-volume ratio, we observed a growth regime with an exponent of 1/2. The same exponent is also found in the case of open membranes with symmetric composition.

Title:Hearing aid patients in private practice and public health (Veterans Affairs) clinics: are they different?
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC', 'Gray GA']
Affiliation:The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. robyncox@memphis.edu
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: In hearing aid research, it is commonplace to combine data across subjects whose hearing aids were provided in different service delivery models. There is reason to question whether these types of patients are always similar enough to justify this practice. To explore this matter, this investigation evaluated similarities and differences in self-report data obtained from hearing aid patients derived from public health (Veterans Affairs, VA) and private practice (PP) settings. DESIGN: The study was a multisite, cross-sectional survey in which 230 hearing aid patients from VA and PP audiology clinic settings provided self-report data on a collection of questionnaires both before and after the hearing aid fitting. Subjects were all older adults with mild to moderately severe hearing loss. About half of them had previous experience wearing hearing aids. All subjects were fitted with wide-dynamic-range-compression instruments and received similar treatment protocols. RESULTS: Numerous statistically significant differences were observed between the VA and PP subject groups. Before the fitting, VA patients reported higher expectations from the hearing aids and more severe unaided problems compared with PP patients with similar audiograms. Three wks after the fitting, VA patients reported more satisfaction with their hearing aids. On some measures VA patients reported more benefit, but different measures of benefit did not give completely consistent results. Both groups reported using the hearing aids an average of approximately 8 hrs per day. VA patients reported age-normal physical and mental health, but PP patients tended to report better than typical health for their age group. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that hearing aid patients seen in the VA public health hearing services are systematically different in self-report domains from those seen in private practice services. It is therefore risky to casually combine data from these two types of subjects or to generalize research results from one group to the other. Further, compared with PP patients, VA patients consistently reported more favorable hearing aid fitting outcomes. Additional study is indicated to explore the determinants of this result and its generalizability to other public health service delivery systems such as those in other countries. Moreover, efforts should be made to assess the potential for transferring positive elements from the VA system to the PP service delivery system, if possible.

Abstract:To be effective in promoting physical activity among urban, minority adolescents, the factors and psychological processes that motivate them to engage in and maintain a physically active lifestyle should be examined. The relation of physical self-efficacy and motivational responses toward physical activity in 46 urban minority adolescents was explored. As hypothesized, there were significant positive relationships among Percieved Physical Ability, Physical Self-presentation Confidence, Effort, and Enjoyment (coefficients ranged from .29 to .80), suggesting that participants who had higher perceived physical ability were likely to report higher perceptions of self-presentation, more enjoyment of physical activity, and harder work in physical activity. These results indicate specific relationships among Effort, Enjoyment, Perceived Physical Ability, and Physical Self-presentation Confidence in this sample. Physical self-efficacy appears to be a stronger predictor of motivational responses in physical activity. Practical implications for physical educators include incorporating strategies known to develop self-efficacy, such as mastery experiences involving successive trials of increasing difficulty, self-observation, external feedback, peer modeling, and verbal persuasion.

Title:The role of the fat body, midgut and ovary in vitellogenin production and vitellogenesis in the female tick, Dermacentor variabilis.
Authors:['Rosell R', 'Coons LB']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Polyclonal antibodies directed against D. variabilis vitellin were utilized for immunocytochemistry at the ultrastructural level. We localized vitellogenin (Vg) in rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternae, secretory granules and secreted products of fat body trophocytes and midgut vitellogenic cells from feeding and ovipositing females. Vg was localized in the oocyte Golgi bodies and in the yolk bodies of both feeding and ovipositing females. Uptake of exogenous Vg was indicated by the presence of immunospecific gold probe in coated pits and coated vesicles at the apical plasma membrane of oocytes from females in rapid engorgement and oviposition. In unmated females little detectable evidence of Vg uptake by developing oocytes suggests that mating and host detachment signal the beginning of vitellogenesis. We conclude that fat body trophocytes, midgut vitellogenic cells and oocytes are involved in the synthesis and/or processing of Vg and that feeding is the signal associated with the initiation of Vg synthesis and/or processing.

Abstract:Defect induced magnetic properties of CoO nanoparticles produced via mechanical ball milling have been assessed by detailed magnetic measurements. A progressive decrease in the particle size and a concomitant increase in the induced strain have been observed with the milling times. The mechanically milled nanoparticles of CoO exhibit anomalous magnetic properties such as FM hysteresis when compared with the unmilled CoO sample. The presence of weak ferromagnetism, with a highest value of magnetization of 0.532 emu/g at 10 K in the 100 h milled sample, is attributed to the uncompensated surface spins resulting from induced surface defects via mechanical milling. The ZFC coercive force, measured at 10 K, increases with milling time reaching a maximum value of 1066 Oe for the 100 h milled sample. The temperature dependent field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetic measurements indicate a presence of an exchange bias field arising from uncompensated moments generated by mechanical strain and the antiferromagnetic (AFM) core. The exchange bias field measured at 10 K reaches a value 210 Oe for the 50 h milled sample and decreases upon prolonged milling. The exchange bias field vanishes at a temperature approximately 200 K, a temperature much lower than the Neel temperature of CoO (TN approximately 291 K). The observed anomalous magnetic behavior of CoO could be interpreted in terms of the exchanged bias FM-AFM model.

Affiliation:Department of Physics, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Nanocomposite of Co-SiO2, a soft magnetic material, with Co weight fraction x = 0.3 and 0.7 was prepared via mechanical milling. The magnetic properties of these samples, both zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC), have been measured as a function of x, milling time, and temperature. The structural assessment of the composite indicates a presence of only ferromagnetic (FM) hcp-Co phase in the composite. However, reported magnetic properties of these composites appear to be dependent on the presence of antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases of cobalt oxide as well. The observed enhancement in ZFC coercivity and a reduction in saturation magnetization with the milling time are due to an increase in defect density upon milling. The ZFC coercivity for the x = 0.3 samples has been found to be much higher than the x = 0.7 samples for all milling times. The coercivity above 50 K depends on temperature according to the law corresponding to isotropic uniaxial superparamagnetic particles. Below 50 K the presence of an AFM phase Co3O4 (TN approximately 33 K) and increased interparticle interactions bring in a departure from that law. The saturation magnetization is found to be temperature dependent for the x = 0.3 samples and temperature independent for the x = 0.7 samples, which further provides evidence of the presence of higher AFM phase fraction in the composite with a low metal volume fraction. The FC magnetic measurements show a presence of an exchange bias field and an enhanced coercivity which are higher than the ZFC measurements. All magnetic measurements indicate that the overall magnetic properties of the composite are dictated by the presence of a trace amount of cobalt oxides.

Abstract:Secondary bacterial infections often complicate respiratory viral infections, but the mechanisms whereby viruses predispose to bacterial disease are not completely understood. We determined the effects of infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3), and influenza virus on the abilities of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae to adhere to respiratory epithelial cells and how these viruses alter the expression of known receptors for these bacteria. All viruses enhanced bacterial adhesion to primary and immortalized cell lines. RSV and HPIV-3 infection increased the expression of several known receptors for pathogenic bacteria by primary bronchial epithelial cells and A549 cells but not by primary small airway epithelial cells. Influenza virus infection did not alter receptor expression. Paramyxoviruses augmented bacterial adherence to primary bronchial epithelial cells and immortalized cell lines by up-regulating eukaryotic cell receptors for these pathogens, whereas this mechanism was less significant in primary small airway epithelial cells and in influenza virus infections. Respiratory viruses promote bacterial adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells, a process that may increase bacterial colonization and contribute to disease. These studies highlight the distinct responses of different cell types to viral infection and the need to consider this variation when interpreting studies of the interactions between respiratory cells and viral pathogens.

Abstract:The spread of H5N1 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) from China to Europe has raised global concern about their potential to infect humans and cause a pandemic. In spite of their substantial threat to human health, remarkably little AIV whole-genome information is available. We report here a preliminary analysis of the first large-scale sequencing of AIVs, including 2196 AIV genes and 169 complete genomes. We combine this new information with public AIV data to identify new gene alleles, persistent genotypes, compensatory mutations, and a potential virulence determinant.

Abstract:Thirty-six healthy men with varying degrees of physical training background performed maximal-effort isometric and isoinertial knee extensor actions, with relative loads equal to 40% and 70% of one-repetition maximum. Force, velocity, and power were derived from force and linear position transducers at 500 Hz. Biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis and analyzed by SDS-PAGE for relative myosin heavy chain (MHC) content. Relative MHC IIx content was included in a regression model, and explained variance noted. Relative MHC I content was subsequently added to the regression model to determine what, if any, additional variance was explained beyond that of MHC IIx. Results indicated that no relationship (r = 0.0 to 0.1) exists between the relative expression of MHC isoforms from the vastus lateralis and isometric/isoinertial performance in a population with diverse training backgrounds. Lack of nervous system adaptations in the untrained subjects in the study possibly attenuates the significant relationship between MHC and in-vivo muscle performance previously established in trained populations.

Title:Influence of a pre-blended antibiotic (gentamicin sulfate powder) on various mechanical, thermal, and physical properties of three acrylic bone cements.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Bhattaram A']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:The aim of this work was to determine an array of mechanical, physical, and thermal properties of three pairs of commercially available acrylic bone cement brands, with the brands in each pair having the same compositions except that one contains 4.22 wt/wt% gentamicin sulfate blended with the powder by the manufacturer and the other one does not. The difference between the pairs was in the viscosity of the curing cement dough, with one pair of 'low-viscosity', one pair of 'medium-viscosity', and one pair of 'high-viscosity' brands being used. Thus, the brands studied cover the range of those used in anchoring some total joint replacements (TJRs). The properties determined were the strength, modulus, and work-to-fracture (all under four-point bending), plane-strain fracture toughness, Weibull mean fatigue life (fatigue conditions: 15 MPa; 2 Hz), activation energy and frequency factor for the cement polymerization process (both determined, using differential scanning calorimetry, at heating rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20 K min (1)), and the diffusion coefficient for the absorption of phosphate-buffered saline at 37 C by the cured cement. For each property determined, there was no significant difference in the mean values for the brands in each of the pairs. These results indicate that over the range of cement brands that are widely used in the anchoring of cemented TJRs, the addition of gentamicin sulfate powder does not degrade the properties of the cement, and, hence, may not adversely affect the in vivo longevity of the replacement.

Title:Alendronate in bone cement: fatigue life degraded by liquid, not by powder.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Janna S']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:Bisphosphonates have the potential to reduce osteolysis, a phenomenon that has been postulated to play a key role in aseptic loosening of total joint replacements. Bisphosphonates may contribute to the in vivo longevity of total joint replacements. Some authors have suggested there are decreases in flexural strength and flexural modulus of the cured cement when a liquid form of disodium pamidronate is added to a commercially available acrylic bone cement (Palacos R). We proposed that it is comparatively easier to blend a bisphosphonate in powder form into an acrylic bone cement than it is when the drug is in liquid form; and that the cement's fatigue life is decreased when the bisphosphonate is added in liquid rather than in solid form. The bisphosphonate and bone cement used were alendronate sodium and Cemex XL, respectively. The fatigue tests were done using phosphate buffered saline solution at 37 degrees +/- 1 degrees C. The data supported both hypotheses. Our findings should guide orthopaedic surgeons when using bisphosphonate-impregnated acrylic bone cements in total joint replacements. Bisphosphonates are endogenous pyrophosphate analogs in which a carbon atom replaces the central oxygen atom. These therapeutic agents may be classified into nitrogen and non-nitrogen containing types. Some examples are alendronate, pamidronate, ibandronate, risedronate, etidronate, clodronate, and zoledronate. There are many targets and mechanisms of action of this family of drugs, therefore making them efficacious against diverse clinical conditions such as osteoporosis, periprosthetic bone loss subsequent to total joint replacement, tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis, Charcot neuroarthropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and spondyloarthropathies, and arterial calcification. It has been proposed that some bisphosphonates are effective against the mechanisms that have been suggested as being implicated in aseptic loosening of total joint replacements, these being osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and wear particle-induced osteolysis. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that alendronate and pamidronate had beneficial effects maintaining periprosthetic bone for as much as 1 year after a total joint replacement.

Title:Upregulation of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits within specific mesocorticolimbic regions during chronic nicotine self-administration.
Authors:['Wang F', 'Chen H', 'Steketee JD', 'Sharp BM']
Affiliation:Department of Pharmacology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.
Abstract:Nicotine, an addictive substance, is the major psychoactive component in cigarette smoke. Both alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are essential for the acute stimulative effects of nicotine on the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, yet little is known about the effects of chronic nicotine treatment on glutamate receptors. Therefore, we used a model of chronic nicotine self-administration (SA), which emulates important aspects of nicotine intake by humans, to determine whether glutamate receptor subunits were affected. After 18 days of saline vs nicotine SA, ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit levels were determined in brain regions within the mesocorticolimbic system by Western blotting. In prefrontal cortex (PFC), the levels of NMDA receptor subunit 2A (NR2A) and NR2B were increased by 67% (p=0.04) and 83% (p=0.027), respectively. In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), glutamate receptor subunit 2/3 (GluR2/3) increased by 34% (p=0.011). Nicotine SA did not affect the expression of these subunits in dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens. These findings suggest that chronic nicotine SA selectively increased the levels of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits in a brain region-specific manner.

Title:Semantic retrieval in DNA-based memories with Gibbs energy models.
Authors:['Neel A', 'Garzon M']
Affiliation:Computer Science, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38153-3240, USA.
Abstract:At least three types of associative memories based on DNA-affinity have been proposed. Previously, we have quantified the quality of retrieval of genomic and abiotic information in simulation by comparison to state-of-the-art symbolic methods available, such as LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis). Their performance is poor when the evaluation criterion for DNA-affinity is a simple approximation of the Gibbs energy that governs duplex formation for retrievals. Here, we use a more realistic approximation of the Gibbs energy to improve semantic retrievals in DNA memories. Their performance is much closer to that of LSA, according to human expert ratings. With more realistic approximations of DNA affinity, performance is expected to improve for other, more adaptive associative memories with compaction in silico, and even more so with actual DNA molecules in vitro.

Title:Uncertainties related to the assignment of a toxic equivalency factor for 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.
Authors:['Sutter CH', 'Rahman M', 'Sutter TR']
Affiliation:W. Harry Feinstone Center for Genomic Research, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:The Toxic Equivalency Factor (TEF) approach is a methodology that assigns relative toxicity values to structurally related chemicals in comparison to a reference chemical. For the polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), the reference is the most potent congener, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Here, we critically review the literature on the effects of a weak PCDD, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD), and describe the uncertainties of assigning its TEF. PCDDs, including OCDD, are less potent in human cell models compared to the rat models from which the TEF are estimated. This lack of concordance is even more pronounced with the weaker congeners such as OCDD. Furthermore, OCDD is also likely to compete with TCDD for binding to cytochrome P4501A2 (CYP1A2), effectively decreasing the hepatic tissue/fat ratio of TCDD. Overall, the predictive value of TEFs would be improved by incorporating into this number the relative sensitivity of human cell responses compared to rodent responses, by determining the toxicological effects of altering the tissue distribution of dioxin-like compounds through competition for CYP-binding sites, and by understanding the mechanism of cancer causation of any dioxin and whether this mechanism is conserved in humans and at equivalent doses.

Abstract:Two methods used for determining the elastic modulus (E) and hardness (H) of a material--the original version of the well-known Oliver-Pharr Method, OOPM, and a variant of it called the Modified Slopes Method, MSM--were critically compared. The nanoindentation test results, of indenter load-versus-indenter displacement, were recorded for six series of specimens, three of commercially-available acrylic bone cements (Palacos R and Cemex XL) and three of bones (human, bovine, and mouse). In the first series, the specimens were prepared from Palacos R cement mantles retrieved from cemented total hip joint replacements after 11 months, 11 years, and 21 years in vivo. In the second and third series, the specimens were fabricated from hand- and vacuum-mixed dough of Cemex XL cement, respectively. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth series, the specimens were prepared from fresh frozen cortical bone of human tibia, plexiform bone from fresh bovine tibia, and femora from inbred mice, respectively. It was found that, for a given material, the values of E or H computed using OOPM and MSM are not significantly different. However, the recommendation is that MSM is preferable because it is straightforward-only the nanoindentation measurements and values of constants that depend on the geometry of the indenter used are needed. In contrast, when the OOPM is used, there is a critical input (the indenter tip area function), whose computation is problematic. The article also includes a succinct discussion of factors that affect the values of material properties computed from nanoindentation measurements, such as the loading rate and the surface roughness of the test specimen.

Title:Young adults' retrospective reports of parenting by mothers and fathers: associations with current relationship quality.
Authors:['Dalton WT 3rd', 'Frick-Horbury D', 'Kitzmann KM']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, USA. wtdalton@texaschildrenshospital.org
Abstract:The authors examined retrospective reports of both mothers' and fathers' parenting and young adults' (N = 75) relationship quality. Multiple regression analyses showed that, as predicted, young adults' retrospective reports of the positive parenting they experienced as children were significantly related to the extent by which they currently viewed (a) others as accessible and responsive, (b) their relationships with others as meaningful and important, and (c) themselves as able to form healthy relationships. Although both mothers' and fathers' parenting related to the quality of current relationships with parents, only reports of fathers' parenting were related to the quality of current relationships with a romantic partner. Fathers' parenting was also related to views of the self as being able to form secure and close relationships. The authors address both methodological and substantive explanations for these results.

Title:Molecular dynamic simulations of the N-terminal receiver domain of NtrC reveal intrinsic conformational flexibility in the inactive state.
Authors:['Hu X', 'Wang Y']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The N-terminal receiver domain of NtrC is the molecular switch in the two-component signal transduction. It is the first protein where structures of both the active (phosphyroylated) and inactive (unphosphyroylated) states are determined experimentally. Phosphorylation of the NtrC at the active site induces large structural change. NMR experiments suggested that the wild type unphosphorylated NtrC adopts both the active and the inactive conformations and the phosphorylation stabilizes the active conformations. We applied free (unconstrained) molecular dynamic (MD) simulation to examine the intrinsic flexibilities and stabilities of the NtrC receiver domain in both the active and inactive conformations. Molecular dynamic simulations showed that the inactive state of NtrC receiver domain is more flexible than the active state. There were large movements in helix 4 and loop beta3-alpha3 which coincide with major structural differences between the inactive and active states. We observed large root-mean-square deviations from the initial starting structure and the large root-mean-square fluctuations during MD simulation for the inactive state. We then investigated the activation pathway with Targeted MD simulation. We show that the intrinsic flexibility in the loop beta3-alpha3 plays an important role in triggering the conformational change. Phosphorylation at the active site may serve to stabilize the conformational change. These results together suggest that the unphosphorylated NtrC receiver domain could be involved in a conformational equilibrium between two different states.

Abstract:Ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in migratory waterfowl, domestic poultry, and humans in Asia during the summer of 2005 present a continuing, protean pandemic threat. We review the zoonotic source of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses and their genesis from their natural reservoirs. The acquisition of novel traits, including lethality to waterfowl, ferrets, felids, and humans, indicates an expanding host range. The natural selection of nonpathogenic viruses from heterogeneous subpopulations co-circulating in ducks contributes to the spread of H5N1 in Asia. Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by co-circulating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines.

Abstract:Interferons (IFNs) are antiviral cytokines that selectively regulate gene expression through several signaling pathways including nuclear factor kappaB(NFkappaB). To investigate the specific role of NFkappaB in IFN signaling, we performed gene expression profiling after IFN treatment of embryonic fibroblasts derived from normal mice or mice with targeted deletion of NFkappaB p50 and p65 genes. Interestingly, several antiviral and immunomodulatory genes were induced higher by IFN in NFkappaB knock-out cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that NFkappaB was basally bound to the promoters of these genes, while IFN treatment resulted in the recruitment of STAT1 and STAT2 to these promoters. However, in NFkappaB knock-out cells IFN induced STAT binding as well as the binding of the IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) to the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) promoters. IRF1 binding closely correlated with enhanced gene induction. Moreover, NFkappaB suppressed both antiviral and immunomodulatory actions of IFN against influenza virus. Our results identify a novel negative regulatory role of NFkappaB in IFN-induced gene expression and biological activities and suggest that modulating NFkappaB activity may provide a new avenue for enhancing the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN.

Abstract:Matricellular proteins mediate both tissue morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis in important ways because they modulate cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. In this study, we found that the matricellular protein osteopontin (Opn) is a novel marker of undifferentiated pancreatic precursors and pancreatic ductal tissues in mice. Our analysis also underscored a specific, dynamic profile of Opn expression in embryonic pancreatic tissues that suggests the participation of this protein's function in processes involving cell migration, cell-cell interactions, or both. Surprisingly, our analysis of Opn-deficient pancreata did not reveal obvious alterations in the morphology or differentiation of these tissues. Therefore, in embryonic pancreatic tissues, it is possible that other proteins act redundantly to Opn or that this protein's function is dispensable for pancreas development. Finally, the maintenance of Opn expression in pancreatic tissues of adults argues for a possible function of this protein in injury and pathologic responses.

Abstract:Trimethoxypropylsilane (TMPS) and bis(trimethoxysilyl)ethane (BTMSE) were used as surface modifiers of metal vie the sol-gel process and dip coating. In addition to the single coating of Al, Cu and Sn, double treatments of Al were also conducted by combining coatings with these sol-gels in different sequences. Reflection and absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIR) was employed to characterize and to trace the proceeding of the sol-gel process of the films. It was found that the silanol condensation occurs in the coating films on Al and the covalent linkage exists between the TMPS film and copper surface. From the assigned vibration modes, two conformers were identified in pure TMPS, TMPS sol-gel and coated film. A series of dip coating experiments with different concentrations of TMPS sol-gel was conducted, and the results from the collected RAIR spectra of the coated samples suggested that the coated Cu consistently has a better RAIR spectrum than that of the coated Al. The TMPS sol-gel appeared to have a better affinity to Cu than to Al. The temperature effect and the aging effect in the coating films were studied. X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to characterize the coated film, and the XPS data confirm the formation of the siloxane film from the silane coupling agents (SCA). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) have been collected for bare Al and Cu, BTMSE sol-gel coated Al, and TMPS sol-gel coated Cu in 0.15M NaCl solution. The corresponding electronic circuit parameters have been determined to match the experimental EIS data.

Abstract:The PREG model of question asking assumes that questions emerge when there is cognitive disequilibrium, as in the case of contradictions, obstacles, and anomalies. Participants read illustrated texts about everyday devices (e.g., a cylinder lock) and then were placed in cognitive disequilibrium through a breakdown scenario (e.g., the key turns but the bolt does not move). The participants asked questions when given the breakdown scenario, and an eyetracker recorded their fixations. As was predicted, deep comprehenders asked better questions and fixated on device components that explained the malfunction. The eye fixations were examined before, during, and after the participants' questions in order to trace the occurrence and timing of convergence on faults, causal reasoning, and other cognitive processes.

Title:Use of warning messages to modify gambling beliefs and behavior in a laboratory investigation.
Authors:['Floyd K', 'Whelan JP', 'Meyers AW']
Affiliation:Institute for Gambling Education and Research, Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:This laboratory study assessed the effectiveness of warning messages intended to aid in the control of gambling. Participants were 120 undergraduate students from an urban state university who reported previous gambling activity. They were recruited to play a computerized roulette game with imaginary money. Money left at the end of play was exchanged for raffle tickets for a prize drawing. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions. In the warning-message condition, participants received an educational component discussing common irrational beliefs expressed by gamblers and, while playing roulette, viewed brief messages that addressed irrational gambling beliefs. In the control condition, participants received an educational component on the history of roulette but no warning messages. Participants in the warning-message condition reported significantly fewer irrational beliefs and demonstrated less risky gambling behavior than those in the control condition.

Title:Threshhold for recovery in the marsh halophyte Spartina alterniflora grown under the combined effects of salinity and soil drying.
Authors:['Brown CE', 'Pezeshki SR']
Affiliation:Westminster Academy, Memphis, TN 38119, USA. cbrown@wamemphis.com
Abstract:A study quantifying the physiological threshhold at which Spartina alterniflora plants are able to tolerate the interactive effects of salinity and soil drying was conducted in a climate controlled greenhouse. The experiment consisted of two levels of salinity (3-5 ppt, L and 35-38 ppt, H) as well as four dynamic water levels: flooding (water level maintained 3-5 cm above the soil surface at high tide and 10 cm below the soil surface at low tide for entire study duration, F), 8-day drought (water level maintained at least 20 cm below the soil surface at high tide for 8 days then flooded, 8 days), 16-day drought (water level maintained at least 20 cm below the soil surface at high tide for 16 days then flooded, 16 days), and 24-day drought (water level maintained at least 20 cm below the soil surface at high tide for 24 days then flooded, 24 days). Plant gas exchange and growth responses were measured along with soil conditions of redox potential and water potential. Significant decreases were seen in plant gas exchange and growth in response to increases in salinity and soil drying. Survival was 100% for all flooded treatments while increased salinity combined with soil drying decreased survival to 86% in both low salt/24-day drought plants (LD24) and high salt/16-day drought plants (HD16). The lowest survival rate was seen in the high salt/24-day drought treatment (HD24) at 29%. Therefore, it appears that the critical time for recovery from the combined effects of increased salinity and soil drying may greatly diminish after two weeks from the onset of stress conditions. Consequently, if salinity continues to increase along the MRDP, marshes dominated by S. alterniflora may be more susceptible to short-term drought and likewise large-scale marsh browning.

Title:Combined chemical and mechanical effects on free radicals in UHMWPE joints during implantation.
Authors:['Jahan MS', 'Wang C', 'Schwartz G', 'Davidson JA']
Affiliation:Department of Physics, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:An electron spin resonance (ESR) technique is employed to determine the free radical distribution in the articulating surfaces of retrieved acetabular cups and knee-joint plateaus (retrieved after more than 6 years of implantation). Similar measurements made on samples prepared from cyclically stressed and unstressed cups, and on samples following oxidations in nitric acid and intralipid solutions provided sufficient data to gain more knowledge about the combined chemical and mechanical effects on PE free radicals during implantation. In UHMWPE free radicals are primarily initiated by gamma-ray sterilization; however, during implantation, peroxy (scission type) free radicals are formed and reach a maximum concentration level (equilibrium state) due to oxidation by chemical (hemoglobin and/or synovial fluids) environment of the joints. Subsequently, due to frictional heating and stress in the loading zones, free radical reaction is accelerated and their number is reduced only in those areas. This is consistent with the observations of a temperature rise in acetabular cups during in vitro frictional wear stress tests and in vivo telemetry observations, as reported by others. Compared with the previously reported SEM micrographs the low-free-radical regions are correlated with high-wear areas and the high-free-radical regions with the low-wear areas.

Title:Reducing the risk of burnout in end-of-life care settings: the role of daily spiritual experiences and training.
Authors:['Holland JM', 'Neimeyer RA']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Individuals in the helping professions are subject to unique stressors that may lead to burnout, and research has shown that those who work with dying or bereaved individuals might be particularly at-risk. This study explores how factors such as spirituality and level of training might buffer the stress of working with terminally ill clients and their families. METHOD: A total of 80 medical and mental health practitioners attending palliative care seminars were surveyed, with each completing validated measures of daily spiritual experiences and caregiver burnout, as well as assessments of demographic factors, their general education and training experiences specific to working in end-of-life care and bereavement settings. RESULTS: Findings indicate that daily spiritual experiences might mitigate physical, cognitive, and emotional forms of burnout in the workplace. In addition, a negative correlation was found between the amount of end-of-life training received and burnout in the physical and cognitive domains. However, training was not related to professionals' level of emotional exhaustion. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RESEARCH: Results reinforce a growing literature on the salutary effects of spirituality, and underscore its relevance as one possible form of constructive coping for professionals attending to the needs of the dying and bereaved. The study carries further implications for how the stresses of such work might be ameliorated by enhanced training efforts, as well as creative facilitation of diverse spiritual expressions (e.g., inclusive forms of ritual recognition of loss) in the workplace.

Title:Sense-making, grief, and the experience of violent loss: toward a mediational model.
Authors:['Currier JM', 'Holland JM', 'Neimeyer RA']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38117, USA. jcurrier@memphis.edu
Abstract:Bereavement following violent loss by accident, homicide or suicide increases the risk for complications in grieving. This is the first study to examine a constructivist model of grief that proposes that sense-making, or the capacity to construct an understanding of the loss experience, mediates the association between violent death and complicated grief symptomatology. An ethnically diverse sample of 1,056 recently bereaved college students completed the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) and questions assessing the degree of sense-making and the circumstances surrounding their losses. Consistent with this study's primary hypothesis, sense-making emerged as an explanatory mechanism for the association between violent loss and complications in grieving. Specifically, the results revealed that sense-making explained this relation, even when the element of sudden bereavement was shared by all of the participants. Overall, this study provides initial support for a model of grief in which failure to find meaning in a loss is conceptualized as a crucial pathway to complicated grief symptomatology.

Title:TANF policy: past, present, and future directions.
Authors:['Washington G', 'Sullivan M', 'Washington ET']
Affiliation:University of Tennessee's College of Social Work in Memphis, USA. gwashing@utk.edu
Abstract:The purpose of this article is to offer a brief and concise history of relevant public welfare policies for a discussion of the effects of public welfare reform, and how it impacts families in ways not comprehensively understood. Social scientists' concerns about the potential for the families to be thrust into an "extreme poverty" status due to the forced workforce participation requirement and expiration of time limited benefits is discussed. A second concern regarding a "one size fits all" approach to work requirements for TANF recipients being unrealistic and insensitive is also discussed. The authors recommend a comprehensive multi-system analysis to determine the impact of welfare reform. There is also a recommendation that the workforce requirements should correlate to an assessment score based on the ability of welfare recipients to function in identified areas. Implications of maintaining a welfare reform policy status quo are identified.

Abstract:The authors evaluated the effect of a brief tailored smoking control intervention delivered during basic military training on tobacco use in a population of military personnel (N = 33,215). Participants were randomized to either a tobacco use intervention (smoking cessation, smokeless tobacco use cessation, or prevention depending on tobacco use history) or a health education control condition. Results indicated that smokers who received intervention were 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04, 1.30) times (7-day point prevalence) and 1.23 (95% CI = 1.07, 1.41) times (continuous abstinence) more likely to be abstinent than controls from smoking cigarettes at the 1-year follow-up (p < .01); the cessation rate difference was 1.60% (31.09% vs. 29.49%) and 1.73% (15.47% vs. 13.74%) for point prevalence and continuous abstinence, respectively. Additionally, smokeless tobacco users were 1.33 (95% CI = 1.08, 1.63) times more likely than controls (p < .01) continuously abstinent at follow-up, an overall cessation rate difference of 5.44% (33.72% vs. 28.28%). The smoking prevention program had no impact on smoking initiation. These results suggest potential for large-scale tobacco control efforts.

Title:Cytokinin Production by Bradyrhizobium japonicum.
Authors:['Sturtevant DB', 'Taller BJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, Memphis, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:Although there is considerable circumstantial evidence for the involvement of cytokinins in legume nodulation, the cytokinins produced by rhizobia have not been well characterized. Bradyrhizobium japonicum 61A68, a bacterium which nodulates soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.), was grown in defined medium. Cytokinins were purified from the culture medium by Amberlite XAD-2 chromatography and fractionated by column chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 in 35% ethanol. Pooled fractions from the Sephadex column were analyzed for cytokinin activity with the tobacco callus bioassay. Cytokinin activity was observed in fractions corresponding to the elution volumes of zeatin, ribosylzeatin, and methylthiozeatin. No activity corresponding to the elution volumes of isopentenyladenine or its riboside was found. Total cytokinin activity in the B. japonicum culture filtrate was equivalent to approximately 1 microgram of kinetin per liter. Transfer RNA was isolated from B. japonicum cells by phenol extraction, followed by potassium acetate extraction, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide precipitation, and DEAE cellulose chromatography. Transfer RNA was enzymically hydrolyzed to nucleosides. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of cytokinin nucleosides showed peaks corresponding to the retention times of trans-ribosylzeatin, methylthioribosylzeatin, isopentenyladenosine, and methylthioisopentenyladenosine. Analysis of the tRNA hydrolysate by Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and tobacco bioassay showed cytokinin activity in fractions corresponding to ribosylzeatin, methylthioribosylzeatin, and isopentenyladenosine. The presence of the trans isomer of ribosylzeatin was also determined by enzyme immunoassay.

Title:Waterpipe smoking among American military recruits.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Waterpipe smoking, a traditional Middle Eastern tobacco use method, has increased dramatically among Arab adolescents and young adults. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that usage is on the rise among young people in the U.S., but epidemiological data are lacking. METHODS: From self-report health surveys collected during 1999-2002, we examined the prevalence and predictors of waterpipe use among U.S. Air Force recruits (n = 20,673; mean age = 20.0 years; range = 17-35). RESULTS: Waterpipe use was reported by 0.3% (n = 59) of recruits and was unrelated to age, gender, ethnicity, or family income. Compared to non-users, waterpipe users were more likely to plan to smoke cigarettes in the coming year (P value < 0.05) and to believe that switching from cigarettes to other tobacco products reduces smoking-related health risks (P values < 0.002). Multivariate (logistic regression) analyses revealed several factors that distinguished waterpipe users from non-users, including higher education level (odds ratio [OR] = 1.94), having experimented with cigarettes before Basic Military Training (BMT; OR = 1.99), and using cigarettes (OR = 2.17) and other tobacco products (OR = 13.81) at the time of entry into BMT. Compared to recruits who used cigarettes only, waterpipe smokers were more educated (OR = 1.83), more likely to have engaged in experimental (OR = 3.30) or regular (OR = 3.87) use of tobacco products other than cigarettes prior to BMT, and less likely to have been a current (OR = 0.10) or former (OR = 0.11) smoker at the time of entry into BMT. CONCLUSION: Despite concerns that waterpipe smoking is increasing among young people in the U.S., use was low among military recruits.

Title:Essential role of PKC-zeta in normal and angiotensin II-accelerated neointimal growth after vascular injury.

Abstract:The contribution of atypical protein kinase C (PKC)-zeta to ANG II-accelerated restenosis after endoluminal vascular injury was investigated by using the rat carotid balloon injury model. Exposure of injured arteries to ANG II resulted in an extensive neointimal thickening (1.9 times) compared with vehicle at day 14. Treatment with PKC-zeta antisense, but not scrambled, oligonucleotides reduced neointimal formation observed in the presence or absence of ANG II. Examination of early events (2 days) after injury showed an increase in cellularity in the perivascular area of the artery wall that was transferred to the adventitia and media after exposure to ANG II, events blocked by PKC-zeta antisense, but not scrambled, oligonucleotides. A positive correlation between medial cellularity at day 2 and extent of neointimal growth at day 14 was established. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that upregulation of inflammatory markers after injury, as well as infiltration of ED1(+) monocytes/macrophages from the perivascular area to the adventitia, was accelerated by ANG II. However, ANG II-stimulated medial increase in cellularity was proliferation independent, and these cells were monocyte chemoattractant protein-1(+)/vimentin(+) but ED1(-)/VCAM(-). PKC-zeta is degraded after injury, and inhibition of its neosynthesis in medial vascular smooth muscle cells or in infiltrating cells with PKC-zeta antisense attenuated medial cellularity and expression of inflammation mediators without reversing smooth muscle cell dedifferentiation. Together, these data indicate that PKC-zeta plays a critical role in normal and ANG II-accelerated neointimal growth through a mechanism involving upregulation of inflammatory mediators, leading to cell infiltration in the media of the vascular wall.

Title:Effect of a liquid multivitamin/mineral supplement on anaerobic exercise performance.

Affiliation:Human Performance Laboratories, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. afry@memphis.edu
Abstract:The purpose of this study was to determine if supplementation with a liquid multi-vitamin/mineral would improve anaerobic exercise performance. Fourteen resistance-trained men performed a 30-second cycle sprint and one set of squat exercise on 2 separate days before and following 8 weeks of supplementation with either a liquid multi-vitamin/ mineral or a placebo. Heart rate, perceived exertion, blood lactate, peak and mean power, and rate of fatigue were determined for all tests. No differences were noted for any variable (P > 0.05). When controlling for presupplementation values, however, a decreased rate of fatigue was noted for both exercise tests following the multi-vitamin/mineral supplementation. These data suggest that in resistance trained men consuming a nutritionally sound diet, supplementation with a liquid multi-vitamin/mineral does not favorably impact most anaerobic exercise performances. Such supplementation, however, may result in a minor decreased rate of fatigue. It appears that, in terms of improved short duration anaerobic exercise performance, supplemental micronutrients may not be efficient ergogenic agents for well-trained individuals consuming an adequate diet.

Title:Review of exercise-induced muscle injury: relevance for athletic populations.
Authors:['Falvo MJ', 'Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Department of Health and Sport Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Exercise-induced skeletal muscle injury is well understood as the product of unfamiliar or strenuous physical activity. Eccentric or lengthening actions are primarily responsible for inducing injury, which subsequently leads to a variety of signs and symptoms. Although significant research supports this finding, most observations are specific to untrained individuals. In addition, many protocols designed both to induce muscle injury and assess performance following the injury are dissimilar from those utilized by physically trained individuals or are impractical in relation to athletic performance or both. Therefore, difficulty may arise when extrapolating information, from the available literature and applying the findings to athletic populations. This review addresses the efficacy of applying our current understanding of exercise-induced skeletal muscle injury to a physically trained population as well as highlights concerns that require future investigation.

Affiliation:Department of Physics, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The effect of asymmetry in the transbilayer lipid distribution on the dynamics of phase separation in fluid vesicles is investigated numerically. This asymmetry is shown to set a spontaneous curvature for the domains that alter the morphology and dynamics considerably. For moderate tension, the domains are capped and the spontaneous curvature leads to anomalously slow dynamics, as compared to the case of symmetric bilayers. In contrast, in the limiting cases of high and low tensions, the dynamics proceeds toward full phase separation.

Title:L-arginine chlorination results in the formation of a nonselective nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor.

Abstract:Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and impaired vascular function are the key pathological characteristics of inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. We have recently found that leukocyte-derived hypochlorous acid is able to react with the nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) substrate L-arginine to produce chlorinated L-arginine (cl-L-Arg). Interestingly, cl-L-Arg potently inhibits the formation of NO metabolites in cultured endothelial cells. It is unknown whether cl-L-Arg has a direct inhibitory effect on endothelial NOS (eNOS). In addition, the effect of cl-L-Arg on the other NOS isoforms, neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS), is also unknown. Therefore, we designed the current study to test the effects of cl-L-Arg on eNOS, nNOS, and iNOS. Using recombinant NOS, we found that cl-L-Arg had a direct inhibitory effect on the activity of NOS. The effect of cl-L-Arg on NOS activity is nonselective, as all three NOS isoforms were inhibited with a similar IC(50). We further determined the effect of cl-L-Arg on the three NOS isoforms at the tissue level. The results demonstrated that cl-L-Arg potently inhibited all three NOS isoform-mediated vessel reactivities, as well as the NOS signaling molecule cGMP. Cl-L-Arg might serve as a novel endogenous NOS inhibitor and an important mediator for vascular dysfunction under inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis. Blocking cl-L-Arg formation may be a new therapeutic approach to cardiovascular diseases.

Title:The thalamic intergeniculate leaflet mediates locomotor activity-induced reversal of phenotype in photoperiod nonresponsive Siberian hamsters.
Authors:['Freeman DA', 'Teubner BJ', 'Goldman BD']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-3540, USA. dfreemn1@memphis.edu
Abstract:The role of the intergeniculate leaflet of the thalamus (IGL) in photoperiod responsiveness was examined in a laboratory-selected line of photoperiod nonresponsive (NR) Siberian hamsters. NR hamsters fail to exhibit typical winter-type responses (i.e., gonadal regression and development of winter-type pelage) when exposed to short day lengths (e.g., 10 h of light/day). Earlier studies revealed that NR hamsters will exhibit winter-type responses when exposed to short photoperiod if they are given free access to a running wheel. The present study tested the hypothesis that this locomotor activity-induced reversal of phenotype is dependent on the IGL. Male NR hamsters underwent destruction of the IGL prior to being housed in short day lengths in cages equipped with running wheels. Activity rhythms were monitored for 8 weeks, after which time pelage response and paired testes weights were obtained. In contrast to sham-operated NR animals given access to running wheels, IGL-ablated animals showed no increase in the duration of nocturnal running wheel activity and became active later in the night than sham-lesioned animals. Lesioned animals also failed to exhibit the typical short photoperiod-induced gonadal regression and pelage molt. The results implicate the IGL in the mechanism by which running wheel activity can influence photoperiodic responses.

Abstract:Family-based interventions for pediatric obesity are defined by active parent involvement in treatment. In the current review the authors examine 31 family-based interventions with published outcome data and distinguish 4 categories of family-based interventions: (a) Target a narrow range of parent behaviors related to eating/exercise and assess change only in terms of child eating, exercise, or weight; (b) target a similarly narrow range of parent behaviors but nevertheless assess program-related changes in general parenting skills or family functioning; (c) target a broad range of parent behaviors related to general parenting and family functioning but do not assess program-related changes in these areas; and (d) target general parenting or family functioning and also assess program-related changes in these areas. The authors highlight methodological and conceptual challenges facing researchers in this area and argue for an even broader family focus in family-based interventions for pediatric obesity.

Abstract:The present study sought to determine whether risk factors for cigarette smoking onset have a stronger influence on Black versus White children, and whether those patterns differ for nonsmokers versus experimental smokers. As part of a larger study, 5,213 seventh graders were surveyed annually for 5 years. The survey instrument assessed cigarette smoking, along with a variety of background variables thought to influence smoking. Results indicated that rebelliousness predicted smoking onset for Black nonsmokers; peer modeling was more influential for Whites. For both ethnicities, socially isolated children were at increased risk. The variables that predicted the shift from experimental to regular smoking were for the most part different from those that predicted smoking onset. Specifically, youths who lived with smokers, viewed smoking as a means to a goal, and experienced few adverse physiological effects of smoking were more likely to increase their cigarette consumption. Overall, we found that, contrary to previous research, risk factors for smoking differed across ethnicity. Further, smoking onset appears to be shaped by forces different from those that accelerate consumption.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To compare the effects of two antioxidant formulas on biomarkers of oxidative stress before and after aerobic exercise. METHODS: Aerobically trained men (N=25) and women (N=23) were assigned to one of three treatments: 400 IU of vitamin E+1 g of vitamin C (V; N=15), a fruit and vegetable juice powder concentrate (FV; N=16), or a placebo (P; N=17). Subjects ran for 30 min at 80% VO(2 max) before, after 2 wk of supplementation, and after a 1-wk washout period. Blood samples were taken before and immediately after exercise and analyzed for protein carbonyls (PC), malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and vitamins C and E. RESULTS: The V treatment increased plasma vitamin C and E after 2 wk (P <or= 0.05), with no change in the FV or P. Postexercise PC values were elevated for all treatments after all exercise bouts (P< 0.0001). Both V and FV attenuated the exercise-induced increase in PC after 2 wk of supplementation (V=21%, FV=17%), and after the 1-wk washout (V=13%, FV=6%) compared with P (P<0.05), with no differences between V and FV. MDA was unaffected by exercise and treatment. A treatment main effect for 8-OHdG was noted, with values for V lower than for FV and P (4.5+/-2.5, 5.5+/-2.7, and 6.0+/-2.5 ng.mL, respectively; P=0.0002). No exercise session or time main effect was noted for 8-OHdG, suggesting that the lower mean value for the V treatment group was not a result of the supplementation. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that V and FV supplementation for 2 wk can attenuate the rise in PC after 30 min of aerobic exercise, even after a 1-wk washout, without an impact on plasma MDA or 8-OHdG.

Abstract:Mouse retina undergoes crucial changes during early postnatal development. By using Affymetrix microarrays, we analyzed gene expression profiles of wild-type 129SvEv/C57BL/6 mouse retinas at postnatal days (P) 7, 10, 14, 18, and 21 and found significantly altered expression of 355 genes. Characterization of these 355 genes provided insight into physiologic and pathologic processes of mouse retinal development during the second and third postnatal weeks, a period that corresponds to human embryogenesis between weeks 12 and 28. These genes formed 6 groups with similar change patterns. Among the genes, sixteen cause retinal diseases when mutated; most of these 16 genes were upregulated in retina during this period. Using the PathArt program, we identified the biological processes in which many of the 355 gene products function. Among the most active processes in the P7-P21 retina are those involved in neurogenesis, obesity, diabetes type II, apoptosis, growth and differentiation, and protein kinase activity. We examined the expression patterns of 58 genes in P7 and adult retinas by searching the Brain Gene Expression Map database. Although most genes were present in various cell types in retinas, many displayed high levels of expression specifically in the outer nuclear, inner nuclear, and/or ganglion cell layers. By combining our 3 analyses, we demonstrated that during this period of mouse retinal development, many genes play important roles in various cell types, multiple pathways are involved, and some genes in a pathway are expressed in coordinated patterns. Our results thus provide foundation for future detailed studies of specific genes and pathways in various genetic and environmental conditions during retinal development.

Abstract:Autotaxin (ATX, nucleotide pyrophosphate/phosphodiesterase-2) is an autocrine motility factor initially characterized from A2058 melanoma cell-conditioned medium. ATX is known to contribute to cancer cell survival, growth, and invasion. Recently ATX was shown to be responsible for the lysophospholipase D activity that generates lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Production of LPA is sufficient to explain the effects of ATX on tumor cells. Cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA) is a naturally occurring analog of LPA in which the sn-2 hydroxy group forms a 5-membered ring with the sn-3 phosphate. Cellular responses to cPA generally oppose those of LPA despite activation of apparently overlapping receptor populations, suggesting that cPA also activates cellular targets distinct from LPA receptors. cPA has previously been shown to inhibit tumor cell invasion in vitro and cancer cell metastasis in vivo. However, the mechanism governing this effect remains unresolved. Here we show that 3-carba analogs of cPA lack significant agonist activity at LPA receptors yet are potent inhibitors of ATX activity, LPA production, and A2058 melanoma cell invasion in vitro and B16F10 melanoma cell metastasis in vivo.

Abstract:Gene expression QTL (eQTL) mapping can suggest candidate regulatory relationships between genes. Recent advances in mammalian phenotype annotation such as mammalian phenotype ontology (MPO) enable systematic analysis of the phenotypic spectrum subserved by many genes. In this study we combined eQTL mapping and phenotypic spectrum analysis to predict gene regulatory relationships. Five pairs of genes with similar phenotypic effects and potential regulatory relationships suggested by eQTL mapping were identified. Lines of evidence supporting some of the predicted regulatory relationships were obtained from biological literature. A particularly notable example is that promoter sequence analysis and real-time PCR assays support the predicted regulation of protein kinase C epsilon (Prkce) by cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (Creb1). Our results show that the combination of gene eQTL mapping and phenotypic spectrum analysis may provide a valuable approach to uncovering gene regulatory relations underlying mammalian phenotypes.

Abstract:Applying quantitative trait analysis methods to genome-wide microarray-derived mRNA expression phenotypes in segregating populations is a valuable tool in the attempt to link high-level traits to their molecular causes. The massive multiple-testing issues involved in analyzing these data make the correct level of confidence to place in mRNA abundance quantitative trait loci (QTL) a difficult problem. We use a unique resource to directly test mRNA abundance QTL replicability in mice: paired recombinant inbred (RI) and F(2) data sets derived from C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) inbred strains and phenotyped using the same Affymetrix arrays. We have one forebrain and one striatum data set pair. We describe QTL replication at varying stringencies in these data. For instance, 78% of mRNA expression QTL (eQTL) with genome-wide adjusted p < or = 0.0001 in RI data replicate at a genome-wide adjusted p < 0.05 or better. Replicated QTL are disproportionately putatively cis-acting, and approximately 75% have higher apparent expression levels associated with B6 genotypes, which may be partly due to probe set generation using B6 sequence. Finally, we note that while trans-acting QTL do not replicate well between data sets in general, at least one cluster of trans-acting QTL on distal Chr 1 is notably preserved between data sets.

Title:Bruton tyrosine kinase is essential for botrocetin/VWF-induced signaling and GPIb-dependent thrombus formation in vivo.
Authors:['Liu J', 'Fitzgerald ME', 'Berndt MC', 'Jackson CW', 'Gartner TK']

Abstract:Botrocetin (bt)-facilitated binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to the platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex on platelets in suspension initiates a signaling cascade that causes alphaIIbbeta3 activation and platelet aggregation. Previous work has demonstrated that bt/VWF-mediated agglutination activates alphaIIbbeta3 and elicits ATP secretion in a thromboxane A2 (TxA2)-dependent manner. The signaling that results in TxA2 production was shown to be initiated by Lyn, enhanced by Src, and propagated through Syk, SLP-76, PI3K, PLCgamma2, and PKC. Here, we demonstrate that the signaling elicited by GPIb-mediated agglutination that results in TxA2 production is dependent on Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk). The results demonstrate that Btk is downstream of Lyn, Syk, SLP-76, and PI3K; upstream of ERK1/2, PLCgamma2, and PKC; and greatly enhances Akt phosphorylation. The relationship(s), if any, between ERK1/2, PLCgamma2, and PKC were not elucidated. The requirement for Btk and TxA2 receptor function in GPIb-dependent arterial thrombosis was confirmed in vivo by characterizing blood flow in ferric chloride-treated mouse carotid arteries. These results demonstrate that the Btk family kinase, Tec, cannot provide the function(s) missing because of the absence of Btk and that Btk is essential for both bt/VWF-mediated agglutination-induced TxA2 production and GPIb-dependent stable arterial thrombus formation in vivo.

Title:Acquisition of nicotine self-administration in adolescent rats given prolonged access to the drug.
Authors:['Chen H', 'Matta SG', 'Sharp BM']

Abstract:As most human tobacco use begins during adolescence and ongoing development of the adolescent central nervous system could affect acquisition of nicotine self-administration (SA), our established rat SA procedure was modified to study adolescent acquisition of SA with prolonged access to nicotine (23 h/day). Postnatal age 43-45 female Lewis rats, without prior shaping, conditioning, or food deprivation, were housed in operant chambers equipped with two levers; pressing the active lever triggered an i.v. injection of nicotine. By the 10th day of SA, rats receiving 7.5, 15, 30, or 60 microg/kg/injection nicotine (free base) obtained 23+/-16, 50+/-8, 65+/-8, or 48+/-5 injections (mean+/-SE), respectively. In the 30 microg/kg/injection group, active : inactive ratio was greater than 2 after SA day 4; 92% of injections occurred during the 12-h active (dark) phase of the light cycle. Main effects (analysis of variance) were shown for day and lever (ie active vs inactive) (p<0.001). Adolescent males showed similar dose-dependent nicotine SA. With the increasing workload imposed by raising the fixed ratio (FR), less nicotine was self-administered at FR 5 and 7 compared to FR 1 and 3. In comparison to adult females self-administering 30 microg/kg/injection of nicotine at FR 1, adolescents acquired nicotine SA at an accelerated rate (p<0.05) and received a greater number of injections (p<0.05) by day 10. In conclusion, when given prolonged access to the drug, both female and male adolescent Lewis rats rapidly acquire nicotine SA within the dosage range and FR constraints previously observed in adult Lewis rats. However, adolescent females acquired the behavior more rapidly and attained higher levels of stable nicotine SA than adults.

Title:Vascular impedance analysis in human pulmonary circulation.
Authors:['Zhou Q', 'Gao J', 'Huang W', 'Yen M']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Vascular impedance is determined by morphometry and mechanical properties of the vascular system, as well as the rheology of the blood. The interactions between all these factors are complicated and difficult to investigate solely by experiments. A mathematical model representing the entire system of human pulmonary circulation was constructed based on experimentally measured morphometric and elasticity data of the vessels. The model consisted of 16 orders of arteries and 15 orders of veins. The pulmonary arteries and veins were considered as elastic tubes and their impedance was calculated based on Womersley's theory. The flow in capillaries was described by the "sheet-flow" theory. The model yielded an impedance modulus spectrum that fell steeply from a high value at 0 Hz to a minimum around 1.5 Hz. At about 4 Hz, it reached a second high and then oscillated around a relatively small value at higher frequencies. Characteristic impedance was 27.9 dyn-sec/cm5. Influence of variations in vessel geometry and elasticity on impedance spectra was analyzed. Simulation results showed good agreement with experimental measurements.

Abstract:The central and peripheral nervous systems exhibit significant embryological, morphological, and functional differences. Moreover, the pathology of most acquired and hereditary neurological diseases preferentially targets specific components of the nervous system. In order to test the hypothesis that central and peripheral neural transcriptomes show fundamental quantitative differences, Affymetrix GeneChip expression arrays were used to compare murine lumbar spinal cord (SC) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) gene expression. As the crucial component of a novel technique to preserve RNA integrity, mice were perfusion-fixed with RNAlater before the SC and DRG were harvested. As per Affymetrix terminology, a total of 111 transcripts were present (P) on all DRG arrays, absent (A) on all SC arrays, and demonstrated at least 10-fold greater expression in DRG than in SC. Conversely, a total of 112 transcripts were present on all SC arrays, absent on all DRG arrays, and showed at least 10-fold greater expression in SC than in DRG. For a subset of transcripts, quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to corroborate and validate microarray results. Among those genes enriched in DRG, many belonged to a few distinct functional classes: G-protein coupled receptor-protein signaling pathways, potassium transport, sodium transport, sensory perception, and cell-surface receptor-linked signal transduction. In contrast, genes associated with synaptic transmission, organic acid transport, neurotransmitter transport, and circulation were enriched in SC. Notably, the majority of genes causally associated with hereditary neuropathies were highly enriched in DRG. These differential neural gene expression profiles provide a robust framework for future molecular and genetic studies of neuropathy and SC diseases.

Abstract:Recent advances in instrumentation and isotope labeling methodology allow proteins up to 100 kDa in size to be studied in detail using NMR spectroscopy. Using 2H/13C/15N enrichment and selective methyl protonation, we show that newly developed 13C direct detection methods can be used to rapidly yield proton and carbon resonance assignments for the methyl groups of Val, Leu, and Ile residues. We present a highly sensitive 13C-detected CH3-TOCSY experiment that, in combination with standard 1H-detected backbone experiments, allows the full assignment of side chain resonances in methyl-protonated residues. Selective methyl protonation, originally developed by Kay and co-workers (Rosen, M. K.; Gardner, K. H.; Willis, R. C.; Parris, W. E.; Pawson, T.; Kay, L. E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996, 263, 627-636; Gardner, K. G.; Kay, L. E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998, 27, 357-406; Goto, N. K.; Kay, L. E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000, 10, 585-592), improves the nuclear relaxation behavior of larger proteins compared to their fully protonated counterparts, allows significant simplification of spectra, and facilitates NOE assignments. Here, we demonstrate the usefulness of the 13C-detected CH3-TOCSY experiment through studies of (i) a medium-sized protein (CbpA-R1; 14 kDa) with a repetitive primary sequence that yields highly degenerate NMR spectra, and (ii) a larger, bimolecular protein complex (p21-KID/Cdk2; 45 kDa) at low concentration in a high ionic strength solution. Through the analysis of NOEs involving amide and Ile, Leu, and Val methyl protons, we determined the global fold of CbpA-R1, a bacterial protein that mediates the pathogenic effects of Streptococcus pneumoniae, demonstrating that this approach can significantly reduce the time required to determine protein structures by NMR.

Abstract:Latent variable mixture modeling was used to identify subgroups of adolescents with distinct profiles of risk factors from individual, family, peer, and broader contextual domains. Data were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Four-class models provided the most theoretically meaningful solutions for both 7th (n = 907; 48% boys) and 11th (n = 1039; 51% boys) graders. The 4-class solution for 7th graders included low risk (LR; 66%), socioeconomic disadvantage (SD; 19%), peer high risk (PHR; 9%), and family high risk (FHR; 6%) groups. Similarly, the 4-class model for 11th graders included LR (32%), SD (43%), high risk (HR; 21%), and FHR (4%) groups. Subgroup membership predicted reported levels of depressive symptoms and conduct problems both concurrently and over time. Strengths and potential limitations of using latent variable mixture modeling to investigate risk profiles for adolescent psychopathology are discussed.

Title:Activity-dependent bidirectional modification of inhibitory synaptic transmission in rat subthalamic neurons.

Abstract:Rebound burst activity can be generated in neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) by strong GABAergic inhibitory inputs from the globus pallidus externa (GPe) that is reciprocally connected with the STN. It has been proposed that the rebound burst activity in STN neurons is a key event for generating synchronized rhythmic burst activity in the GPe-STN loop, which may be relevant to the resting tremor in Parkinson's disease. Here we report that rebound burst firing of STN neurons induces long-lasting bidirectional modifications of GABAergic synaptic transmission in STN neurons themselves. Using the gramicidin perforated-patch clamp technique in the brain slice preparation, we recorded IPSPs from STN neurons during electrical stimulation of the internal capsule. Rebound spikes triggered by hyperpolarizing current pulses were used to induce modification of inhibitory synaptic transmission. We found that long-lasting potentiation of IPSPs could be induced in the neurons exhibiting three or more rebound spikes that had interspike intervals shorter than half of those during base spontaneous activity, whereas long-lasting depression or no change of IPSP amplitude was likely to be observed in neurons that had no rebound burst or two rebound spikes within a burst. The potentiation or depression of IPSPs was associated with a negative or positive shift of reversal potential of IPSPs (E(IPSP)). The modifications of IPSPs were dependent on activation of postsynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels. This study is the first demonstration that activity-dependent bidirectional modifications of inhibitory synaptic transmission are attributable to bidirectional shifts of E(IPSP).

Title:Novel model of inflammatory neointima formation reveals a potential role of myeloperoxidase in neointimal hyperplasia.

Abstract:Atherosclerosis, which is characterized by neointima formation, is an inflammatory disease. However, there is no inflammatory product-elicited neointimal model to support the causal role of inflammation in atherogenesis. We reported previously that leukocyte-derived MPO induces vascular injury responses such as endothelial dysfunction. We now test the role of MPO in inflammatory neointima formation. We infused temporarily isolated rat common carotid arteries with MPO (200 nM) and incubated for 1 h. We found that although MPO itself did not induce any neointima formation 2 wk after treatment, in the presence of its substrate, hydrogen peroxide, MPO was able to elicit neointimal hyperplasia. We further confirmed that MPO-induced neointimal hyperplasia is mediated by its product, hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl elicited apoptosis both in intima and media followed by vascular proliferative response and resulted in neointima formation with a heterogeneous cell population. Both histological and functional features of HOCl-treated vessels are similar to those in atherosclerotic lesions. To our knowledge, this is the first direct in vivo demonstration of neointimal formation induced by a product of the inflammatory cascade. The results suggest that MPO may be a mediator for pathological neointima growth. This novel neointimal model could be useful for studying inflammation and atherosclerosis.

Abstract:Ethanolamine kinase catalyzes the first step in the CDP-ethanolamine pathway for the formation of the major membrane phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn). In this work, the predicted Etnk2 cDNA was established as a soluble protein with ethanolamine-specific kinase activity that was most highly expressed in liver. Mice with an inactivated Etnk2 gene were derived, and its absence reduced the rate of PtdEtn synthesis from exogenous ethanolamine in hepatocytes. PtdEtn is a major precursor to phosphatidylcholine in liver; however, Etnk2(-/-) mice did not have reduced amounts of either PtdEtn or phosphatidylcholine or an altered phospholipid molecular species distribution. The knock-out animals were able to adapt to a choline-deficient diet. The Etnk2(-/-) mice exhibited a maternal-specific intrauterine growth retardation phenotype that resulted in a 33% reduction in litter size and frequent perinatal death. Histological analysis of pregnant Etnk2(-/-) females showed that fetal development failed at the late stage of pregnancy in a significant percentage of embryos because of the appearance of extensive placental thrombosis. These results illustrate a non-redundant role for EtnK2 expression in regulating placental hemostasis.

Abstract:Bacterial infection after implant placement is a significant rising complication. In order to reduce the incidence of implant-associated infections, several biomaterial surface treatments have been proposed. In this study, the effect of in vitro antibacterial activity and in vitro cytotoxicity of co-sputtered silver (Ag)-containing hydroxyapatite (HA) coating was evaluated. Deposition was achieved by a concurrent supply of 10 W to the Ag target and 300 W to the HA target. Heat treatment at 400 degrees C for 4 h was performed after 3 h deposition. X-ray diffraction, contact angles measurements, and surface roughness were used to characterize the coating surfaces. The RP12 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 35984) and the Cowan I strain of Staphylococcus aureus were used to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the Ag-HA coatings, whereas human embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells, an osteoblast precursor cell line, were used to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of the coatings. X-ray diffraction analysis performed in this study indicated peaks corresponding to Ag and HA on the co-sputtered Ag-HA surfaces. The contact angles for HA and Ag-HA surfaces were observed to be significantly lower when compared to Ti surfaces, whereas no significant difference in surface roughness was observed for all groups. In vitro bacterial adhesion study indicated a significantly reduced number of S. epidermidis and S. aureus on Ag-HA surface when compared to titanium (Ti) and HA surfaces. In addition, no significant difference in the in vitro cytotoxicty was observed between HA and Ag-HA surfaces. Overall, it was concluded that the creation of a multifunctional surface can be achieved by co-sputtering the osteoconductive HA with antibacterial Ag.

Title:The amount of time that a meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus, self-grooms is affected by its reproductive state and that of the odor donor.

Abstract:Many hypotheses have been put forth to account for differences in the amount of time that animals engage self-grooming when exposed to conspecifics or their odors, but most ignore the possibility that self-grooming may be associated with olfactory communication between groomers and conspecifics. As yet, we do not know the function of self-grooming and why animals do so when they encounter the odors of conspecifics. The present experiment tests the hypothesis that the amount of time that a meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus, self-grooms is affected by the reproductive state of the odor donor and its own reproductive state. The findings support the hypothesis. Male voles spent more time self-grooming when they were exposed to bedding scented by female voles in postpartum estrus (PPE) compared to that of female voles in other reproductive states and female mice. PPE female voles spent more time self-grooming when they were exposed to bedding scented by testosterone-treated male voles than either to that of gonadectomized male voles and male mice. PPE female voles spent more time than OVX+E and more time than OVX females self-grooming when they were exposed to bedding scented by testosterone-treated male voles. GX+T male voles spent more time than GX male voles self-grooming when they were exposed to bedding scented by PPE female voles. The results suggest that individuals self-groom more in the presence of an odor of a highly receptive potential mate than that of a less receptive mate.

Title:beta2-Adrenergic receptor downregulation and performance decrements during high-intensity resistance exercise overtraining.

Abstract:Previous research on overtraining due to excessive use of maximal resistance exercise loads [100% 1 repetition maximum (1 RM)] indicates that peripheral muscle maladaptation contributes to overtraining-induced performance decrements. This study examined the cellular and molecular responses of skeletal muscle to performance decrements due to high-relative-intensity (%1 RM) resistance exercise overtraining. Weight-trained men were divided into overtrained (OT, n = 8) and control (Con, n = 8) groups. The OT group performed 10 x 1 at 100% 1 RM daily for 2 wk, whereas the Con group performed normal training 2 days/wk. Muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis muscle, voluntary static and dynamic muscle performances, and nocturnal urinary epinephrine were assessed before (pre) and after (post) overtraining. Overtraining occurred as indicated by a decrease in 1-RM strength for the OT group (mean +/- SE; OT pre = 159.3 +/- 10.1 kg, OT post = 151.4 +/- 9.9 kg, Con pre = 146.0 +/- 12.9 kg, Con post = 144.9 +/- 13.3 kg), as well as a 36.3% decrease in mean power at 100% 1-RM loads. Normal training could be resumed only after 2-8 wk of training cessation. Muscle beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR; fmol/mg protein) density significantly decreased by 37.0% for the OT group and was unchanged for the Con group (-1.8%). Nocturnal urinary epinephrine for the OT group increased by 49%, although this was not significant (effect size = 0.42). The ratio of nocturnal urinary epinephrine to beta(2)-AR density suggested a decreased beta(2)-AR sensitivity for the OT group (2.4-fold increase). Overtraining occurred based on decreased muscular force and power. Desensitization of the beta(2)-AR system suggests that this may be an important contributor to performance decrements due to excessive use of maximal resistance exercise loads.

Abstract:PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to measure the oxidative stress response to similarly matched work bouts of squat and sprint exercise. METHODS: Twelve anaerobically trained men performed six 10-s sprints and, on a separate occasion, repeated barbell squats to approximately equal the amount of work performed during the sprints. Blood lactate, heart rate, and perceived exertion was measured before and following each exercise bout. Muscle soreness, muscle force, and creatine kinase activity was determined preexercise and through 48 h of recovery. Desmin cytoskeletal protein was determined via muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis before and at 24 h following each exercise. Plasma protein carbonyls (PC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured as biomarkers of oxidative stress. RESULTS: Heart rate and perceived exertion was not different between exercise sessions (P > 0.05), although lactate was higher following sprinting compared with squatting (P = 0.002). Muscle soreness was greater for squatting than sprinting (P = 0.003) and reached a peak immediately postexercise for both sessions (P = 0.0003). Muscle force was unaffected by either exercise session (P > 0.05), and creatine kinase activity was elevated to a similar extent following both sessions. Desmin-negative fibers were virtually nonexistent after either exercise bout, indicating no loss of this cytoskeletal protein. Neither PC nor MDA was affected by the exercise (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in anaerobically trained men, the oxidative stress and muscle injury response to similarly matched anaerobic exercise bouts is minimal, and not different between exercise modes. Furthermore, when compared with previous literature on untrained subjects, the response is significantly attenuated, possibly because of adaptations occurring as a result of chronic, strenuous anaerobic training.

Title:Regioselective 2-hydroxylation of 17beta-estradiol by rat cytochrome P4501B1.

Abstract:Previous work demonstrated that human cytochrome P4501B1 (CYP1B1) forms predominantly 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE2), a metabolite which is carcinogenic in animal models. Here, we present results from kinetic studies characterizing the formation of 4-OHE2 and 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE2) by rat CYP1B1 using 17beta-estradiol (E2) as a substrate. Km and Kcat values were estimated using the Michaelis-Menten equation. For rat CYP1B1, the apparent Km values for the formation of 4-OHE2 and 2-OHE2 were 0.61+/-0.23 and 1.84+/-0.73 microM; the turnover numbers (Kcat) were 0.23+/-0.02 and 0.46+/-0.05 pmol/min/pmol P450; and the catalytic efficiencies (Kcat/Km) were 0.37 and 0.25, respectively. For human CYP1B1, the apparent Km values for the formation of 4-OHE2 and 2-OHE2 were 1.22+/-0.25 and 1.10+/-0.26; the turnover numbers were 1.23+/-0.06 and 0.33+/-0.02; and the catalytic efficiencies were 1.0 and 0.30, respectively. The turnover number ratio of 4- to 2-hydroxylation was 3.7 for human CYP1B1 and 0.5 for rat CYP1B1. These results indicate that, although rat CYP1B1 is a low Km E2 hydroxylase, its product ratio, unlike the human enzyme, favors 2-hydroxylation. The Ki values of the inhibitor 2,4,3',5'-tetramethoxystilbene (TMS) for E2 4- and 2-hydroxylation by rat CYP1B1 were 0.69 and 0.78 microM, respectively. The Ki values of 7,8-benzoflavone (alpha-NF) for E2 4- and 2-hydroxylation by rat CYP1B1 were 0.01 and 0.02 microM, respectively. The knowledge gained from this study will support the rational design of CYP1B1 inhibitors and clarify results of CYP1B1 related carcinogenesis studies performed in rats.

Abstract:Tyrosine-phosphorylated villin regulates actin dynamics, cell morphology, and cell migration. Previously, we identified four tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the amino-terminal domain of villin. In this study we report six new sites in the carboxyl-terminal region of the villin core. With this study we document all phosphorylatable tyrosine residues in villin and map them to functions of villin. In this study, we identify for the first time the functional relevance of the carboxyl-terminal domains of the villin core. Expression of the carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation site mutant, as well as the villin truncation mutant S1-S3, inhibited cell migration in HeLa and Madin-Darby canine kidney Tet-Off cells, confirming the role of the carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites in villin-induced cell migration. The carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites were found to be critical for the interaction of villin with its ligand phospholipase C-gamma1 and for its localization to the developing lamellipodia in a motile cell. The results presented here elucidate the molecular basis for tyrosine-phosphorylated villin-induced changes in cell motility.

Title:Estimation of the optimum loading of an antibiotic powder in an acrylic bone cement: gentamicin sulfate in SmartSet HV.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Janna S']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis. Memphis, TN, 38152-3180. USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: In some countries, commercially available antibiotic powder-loaded acrylic bone cement is routinely used in joint replacement, while, in others, "off-label" formulations are used in selected procedures (where the antibiotic powder is blended manually with the powder of a plain cement in the operating room/theater by either the surgeon or approved personnel). In the latter situation, an arbitrary rather than a rational approach is used for deciding on the amount of the antibiotic that is blended with the cement powder (herein referred to as "the antibiotic powder loading"). METHODS AND RESULTS: The first objective of this study was to present two methods for estimating the optimum loading of gentamicin sulfate powder that may be blended manually with the powder of a commercially available acrylic bone cement, ABC (Wopt). The second objective was to define the challenges associated with each of these methods. The loading (W) was optimized with respect to two key properties of the cured cement that were obtained simultaneously, namely (1) fatigue life in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS) at 37 degrees C, and (2) the rate of elution of the gentamicin from the cement (E) in that medium. Three sets of specimens were used, containing 2.25, 4.25 and 11.50 wt/wt% of the gentamicin that was blended manually with the cement powder. The fatigue tests involved determining the number of cycles at which a specimen fractured (Nf) when subjected to fully-reversed tension-compression sinusoidal load, +/- 15 MPa at 2 Hz. E was determined from the concentration of gentamicin in the PBS solution when the specimen fractured, using fluorescence polarization immunoassay for the measurement. Consistent with a priori expectations, it was found that, with increase in W, Nf decreased while E increased. Two approaches for obtaining an estimate of Wopt are described, a mathematical method and an empirical one, that lead to Wopt values of 6.50 wt/wt% and 4.78 wt/wt%, respectively. Thus, this antibiotic loading ranges from about the same to about 92% greater than that in SmartSet GHV Gentamicin, which is a commercially available bone cement used clinically and which has the same composition as SmartSet HV except for the presence of gentamicin sulfate in its powder (blended in by the manufacturer). INTERPRETATION: We present and critically compare two rational methods of determining the optimum loading of an antibiotic powder in an acrylic bone cement, which should serve as a guide when using "off-label" antibiotic powder-loaded acrylic bone cements in cemented joint replacements.

Title:Techniques and considerations for determining isoinertial upper-body power.
Authors:['Falvo MJ', 'Schilling BK', 'Weiss LW']
Affiliation:Exercise Neuromechanics Laboratory, Department of Health and Sport Sciences, The University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Power is an integral aspect of many sports. Although power output of the lower body is often measured during jumping and cycling movements, much less is known about power as pertains to the upper body musculature. Recently, isoinertial methods--with constant gravitational load--of power testing have become common, but little is known of the reliability and criterion validity of these tests as they pertain to sport performance. In addition, the varied methodology makes a lucid model more evasive. The aims of this review are to examine the various methods of assessing upper body power, to establish its role in predicting athletic performance, and to assess the body of literature that has assessed power output of the upper extremities by isoinertial methods. To our knowledge, only two studies on isoinertial upper-body power have shown a direct correlation to sporting ability (Baker, 2001; Baker et al., 2001); therefore, many unanswered questions exist as to the efficacy of these tests as predictors of athletic ability or as a method to track athletes' training over time. From this review we hope to allow the sport coach to assess the overall utility of these tests in terms of availability, safety and external validity.

Abstract:The purpose of this investigation was to determine if a single set of strenuous squat exercise would result in an acute oxidative stress, as demonstrated previously by a single sprint. Thirteen resistance trained men performed one set of 15 repetitions of barbell squats using 70% of one repetition maximum and a 30 s maximal cycle sprint on two different occasions. The total work performed was calculated for each exercise bout. Heart rate, perceived exertion, blood lactate, protein carbonyls, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, and malondialdehyde were measured before and within 1 min following exercise. No differences were noted between the squat and sprint tests for total work, heart rate or perceived exertion. An exercise test by time interaction was evident for blood lactate with values greater following sprinting compared to squatting (P=0.0005). Postexercise protein carbonyls were not different between exercise tests but were elevated above rest (P=0.04) by 111% and 74% following sprinting and squatting, respectively, while 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and malondialdehyde were relatively unaffected by either exercise test. These data indicate that a single bout of strenuous squatting and sprinting performed by resistance trained men results in elevated protein carbonyls, while having little impact on 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine or malondialdehyde during the immediate postexercise period.

Title:Continuing bonds and reconstructing meaning: mitigating complications in bereavement.

Abstract:Drawing on attachment theory and constructivist conceptualizations of bereavement, the authors assessed the relation between continuing bonds coping and meaning reconstruction following the death of a loved one and complicated grief symptomatology. Five hundred six young adults in the first two years of bereavement from a variety of losses completed the Inventory of Complicated Grief along with measures of the strength of their ongoing attachment to the deceased and their capacity to make sense of the loss, find benefit in the experience, and reconstruct a progressive sense of identity following the death. Several variables concerning the survivor, his or her relationship to the deceased, and the nature of the death functioned as risk factors for heightened distress, but their role was generally moderated by meaning-making, often to the point of non-significance. In contrast, higher levels of benefit-finding and positive identity change were associated with lower levels of bereavement complication. Finally, an interaction emerged between sense-making and ongoing attachment to the deceased, suggesting that strong continuing bonds predicted greater levels of traumatic and especially separation distress, but only when the survivor was unable to make sense of the loss in personal, practical, existential, or spiritual terms.

Abstract:The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term stability of auditory N1 sources using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Data collected from 72 electrodes in ten young adult female participants were analyzed. For each participant, N1 peak amplitude and latency values at Cz (referred to M2) were compared for right, left, and bilateral stimulation across three separate recording sessions. Further, sources calculated by LORETA were analyzed in three regions of interest: right temporal, left temporal, and frontal. Peak amplitude and latency measurements were stable across session and ear of stimulation. Three-way RM-ANOVAs revealed relatively stable source amplitudes and stable three-dimensional locations of the sources in each region of interest with shifts of up to 2 cm around the mean locations. The 2 cm variability may be attributable both to normal hemispheric asymmetries and electrode placement variability. These results suggest that N1 scalp activity and its underlying sources are stable.

Title:Intracellular inhibition of carboxylesterases by benzil: modulation of CPT-11 cytotoxicity.

Abstract:Carboxylesterases are ubiquitous proteins responsible for the detoxification of xenobiotics. However, these enzymes also activate prodrugs, such as the anticancer agents capecitabine and CPT-11. As a consequence, overexpression of carboxylesterases within tumor cells sensitizes these cells to CPT-11. We have recently identified two classes of carboxylesterase inhibitors based on either a benzil (diphenylethane-1,2-dione) or a benzene sulfonamide scaffold and showed that these compounds inhibit carboxylesterases with Kis in the low nanomolar range. Because both classes of inhibitors show reversible enzyme inhibition, conventional in vitro biochemical assays would not accurately reflect the in situ levels of carboxylesterase activity or inhibition. Therefore, we have developed a novel assay for the determination of intracellular carboxylesterase activity using 4-methylumbelliferone as a substrate. These studies show that benzil and a dimethylbenzil analogue efficiently enter cells and inhibit human intestinal carboxylesterase and rabbit liver carboxylesterase intracellularly. This inhibition results in reduced cytotoxicity to CPT-11 due to the lack of carboxylesterase-mediated conversion of the prodrug to SN-38. These results suggest that intracellular modulation of carboxylesterase activity with benzil or its analogues may be applied to minimize the toxicity of normal cells to CPT-11.

Title:Computer-aided meiotic maturation assay (CAMMA) of zebrafish (danio rerio) oocytes in vitro.
Authors:['Lessman CA', 'Nathani R', 'Uddin R', 'Walker J', 'Liu J']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Department of Biology, Memphis, TN 38152-3540, USA. Clessman@memphis.edu
Abstract:We have developed a new technique called Computer-Aided Meiotic Maturation Assay (CAMMA) for imaging large arrays of zebrafish oocytes and automatically collecting image files at regular intervals during meiotic maturation. This novel method uses a transparency scanner interfaced to a computer with macro programming that automatically scans and archives the image files. Images are stacked and analyzed with ImageJ to quantify changes in optical density characteristic of zebrafish oocyte maturation. Major advantages of CAMMA include (1) ability to image very large arrays of oocytes and follow individual cells over time, (2) simultaneously image many treatment groups, (3) digitized images may be stacked, animated, and analyzed in programs such as ImageJ, NIH-Image, or ScionImage, and (4) CAMMA system is inexpensive, costing less than most microscopes used in traditional assays. We have used CAMMA to determine the dose response and time course of oocyte maturation induced by 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (HP). Maximal decrease in optical density occurs around 5 hr after 0.1 micro g/ml HP (28.5 degrees C), approximately 3 hr after germinal vesicle migration (GVM) and dissolution (GVD). In addition to changes in optical density, GVD is accompanied by streaming of ooplasm to the animal pole to form a blastodisc. These dynamic changes are readily visualized by animating image stacks from CAMMA; thus, CAMMA provides a valuable source of time-lapse movies for those studying zebrafish oocyte maturation. The oocyte clearing documented by CAMMA is correlated to changes in size distribution of major yolk proteins upon SDS-PAGE, and, this in turn, is related to increased cyclin B(1) protein.

Abstract:The movement of anionic porphyrins (for example, haem) across intracellular membranes is crucial to many biological processes, but their mitochondrial translocation and coordination with haem biosynthesis is not understood. Transport of porphyrins into isolated mitochondria is energy-dependent, as expected for the movement of anions into a negatively charged environment. ATP-binding cassette transporters actively facilitate the transmembrane movement of substances. We found that the mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCB6 is upregulated (messenger RNA and protein in human and mouse cells) by elevation of cellular porphyrins and postulated that ABCB6 has a function in porphyrin transport. We also predicted that ABCB6 is functionally linked to haem biosynthesis, because its mRNA is found in both human bone marrow and CD71+ early erythroid cells (by database searching), and because our results show that ABCB6 is highly expressed in human fetal liver, and Abcb6 in mouse embryonic liver. Here we demonstrate that ABCB6 is uniquely located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and is required for mitochondrial porphyrin uptake. After ABCB6 is upregulated in response to increased intracellular porphyrin, mitochondrial porphyrin uptake activates de novo porphyrin biosynthesis. This process is blocked when the Abcb6 gene is silenced. Our results challenge previous assumptions about the intracellular movement of porphyrins and the factors controlling haem biosynthesis.

Title:Percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for the stand-alone augmentation of osteoporosis-induced vertebral compression fractures: present status and future directions.
Authors:['Lewis G']

Abstract:Enormous research efforts are being expended on two minimally invasive procedures: percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP). The present report, which is a detailed critical review of VP and KP that emphasizes their biomechanics aspects, is divided into six parts. In the first two parts, succinct descriptions are given of osteoporosis-induced vertebral body (VB) compression fractures as the underlying pathology to be treated with VP and KP, the theory of VP and KP, and the techniques used in performing these procedures. Concerns about VP and KP, such as the high radiation exposure burden that may be imposed on both patient and medical personnel and extravasation of the injectable bone cement, are discussed in the third part. Detailed discussions of fourteen issues/questions, such as the extent to which VP or KP affects various biomechanical measures of the augmented VB and those adjacent to it and the appropriate volume of the cement to use, are presented in the fourth part. Ideas for future research, such as development of a new generation of injectable bone cements and identification of an appropriate animal model, are covered in the fifth part. The final section contains a summary of the most salient points/observations made in the report.

Authors:['Bergeron R', 'Floyd RG']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, TN 38120, USA.
Abstract:Group and individual broad ability profiles of children with mental retardation and a matched sample of children with average achievement was investigated through use of the 7 Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) factor clusters from the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Abilities. Results indicate that, as a group, the ranked performance of the children with mental retardation on the CHC factor clusters was largely consistent with the clusters' g loadings. When compared to average-achieving matches, the children with mental retardation scored lower on all CHC factor clusters, but the groups displayed different patterns of performance. Despite normative deficiencies in IQs, children with mental retardation demonstrated a wide range of performance across measures. Implications for assessment and diagnosis are discussed.

Abstract:A sol-gel has been prepared by using allyltrimethoxysilane (ATMS) as precursor, ethanol as homogenizer as well as solvent, and hydrochloric acid as catalyst. The sol-gel was employed for the coating treatment of aluminum. Self-assembled monolayer (SAM) with allyltrichlorosilane (ATCS) is another method used for the metal surface treatment in the present work. The treated metal surfaces were characterized with reflection adsorption infrared spectra (RAIR). Detailed interpretation and vibrational assignment have been given to the collected IR spectra of the sol-gel, xerogel and surface films of ATMS and the SAM of ATCS on aluminum as well as pure silanes. A series of investigation of the UV exposure and temperature effects has been carried out. Results from the investigation indicate that the UV radiation exposure or the high temperature thermal treatment will induce a chemical process on the organosilica coated surfaces.

Title:Similarities between female meadow voles mating during post-partum oestrus and raising two concurrent litters and females raising only one litter.
Authors:['del Barco-Trillo J', 'Ferkin MH']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Ellington Hall, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. jtrillo@memphis.edu
Abstract:In many species of small mammals, females undergo post-partum oestrus soon after delivering a litter, becoming pregnant while suckling the previous litter. Females raising two concurrent litters need to allocate many more resources to reproduction than females raising only one litter. Consequently, there may be differences between litters raised concurrently or singly. We investigated this issue in the meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus, a species in which most females in the wild reproduce during post-partum oestrus. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that the development of pups in two concurrent litters differs from that of pups in a single litter. To test this hypothesis, we measured the following variables for concurrent and singly reared litters: gestation length; litter size; sex ratio; bodyweight of males and females at different ages; total litter weight at weaning; growth rates; and intra-litter variation in body mass. Except for bodyweight of males at 60 days of age, which was higher in the first of the concurrent litters, none of the variables differed among the litters. These results indicate that females are able to adjust to differing loads of maternal care to provide equivalent resources to concurrent litters and singly reared litters.

Title:Influence of changes in the composition of an acrylic bone cement on its polymerization kinetics.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Mishra SR']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-3180, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:It has been suggested in the literature that a lower polymerization rate of an acrylic bone cement is favorable for the in vivo longevity of a cemented arthroplasty. The present work was a study of the influence of three changes in the composition of an acrylic bone cement (when taken separately) on the cement polymerization rate at 37 degrees C (assumed to be the temperature in the bone bed during a cemented arthroplasty) [k']. The changes were the amount of copolymer as a proportion of the total powder weight (in cements in which there is a copolymer in the powder), the amount of DMPT as a proportion of the total volume of the liquid monomer, and the accelerator. k' was calculated using values of the activation energy and the frequency factor (assuming the polymerization reaction is Arrhenius in nature) that were computed from measurements made using the nonisothermal mode of differential scanning calorimetry. Statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA, with Bonferroni correction, and factorial ANOVA) of the k' values showed that the change in accelerator had a significant influence on k'. The importance of this finding, together with results from two relevant literature reports, is discussed within the context of the use of modified bone cements in cemented arthroplasties.

Abstract:The effects of contextual interference on learning pistol-shooting skills in a natural training environment were examined. The shooting skills consisted of three "stages" with different requirements for the skill variations commonly used in the field. 12 participants were randomly assigned into one of two practice conditions, blocked vs serial. Following a 20-min. safety and skill instructional session, Blocked group practiced 10 trials in a row at each stage, while Serial group performed 5 trials in a row for each of the three stages and then repeated the cycle. Both groups completed a total of 30 practice trials over the three stages. A 10-min. rest interval was provided prior to a retention test which included 9 trials (3 trials at each stage in a blocked format). Results based on the data of Stage III, the most complex skill among the three stages, showed a pattern consistent with previous findings that practicing in the serial schedule depressed performance during initial training but maintained the performance better at retention, relative to the blocked practice.

Title:Evaluation of an accelerated aging medium for acrylic bone cement based on analysis of nanoindentation measurements on laboratory-prepared and retrieved specimens.

Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:The thrust of the study was a critical evaluation of the efficacy of a medium (30% v/v H(2)O(2), at 60 degrees C) that has been suggested in a literature report as being suitable for simulating the oxidative aging process, seen in vivo, in the acrylic bone cement mantles of total hip and knee joint replacements. For this purpose, quasi-static and dynamic nanoindentation measurements were used to obtain material properties--elastic modulus, E; hardness, H; and the variation of the storage and loss moduli with the frequency of the applied indenting force--of PalacosR acrylic bone cement specimens after various periods of immersion (7, 14, 21, and 28 days) in the aging solution, and of specimens prepared from cement mantles retrieved from cemented total hip joint replacements after various times in vivo (0.92-21 years). Also, best-fit relationships were obtained between E and time in the H(2)O(2) solution (t), H and t, E and in vivo time (T), and H and T. This body of results points to the possibility that the aging solution is effective, although the evidence is not conclusive.

Authors:['Bhagat SP']

Abstract:The purpose of this investigation was to compare the effects of monaural and binaural stimulation on unilaterally-measured vestibular evoked myogenic potential (VEMP) magnitude and latency. The subjects were eighteen normal-hearing adults with no history of vestibular disease. Monaural VEMPs were acquired with air-conducted (AC) and bone-conducted (BC) 500 Hz tone bursts presented at 95 dB nHL and 70 dB nHL, respectively. These stimuli were simultaneously paired with 95 dB nHL contralateral tone bursts at 250, 500, 750, or 1000 Hz during acquisition of binaural VEMPs. Results indicated that AC-VEMP relative magnitudes decreased in each of the binaural conditions compared to the monaural condition. However, no changes in relative magnitude between conditions occurred for BC-VEMPs. Similar latencies were observed for monaural and binaural VEMPs. Differences in bilateral interaction seen between the AC-VEMP and BC-VEMP conditions are consistent with modification of sound transmission through the ear during presentations of binaural sound.

Abstract:A finite element analysis of the stresses in a construct, comprising a three-dimensional model of the proximal human femur in which the stem of a total hip joint replacement was cemented, was performed. The one-legged standing condition was used, with all applied forces on the proximal femur being considered. These forces were the resultant hip joint reaction force and the forces due to the activation of the abductor, ilio-psoas, and ilio-tibialis muscles. The cortical and cancellous bones were assigned anisotropic elastic properties. It was found that the mean value of the strain energy density at each of the regions considered was considerably higher when debonding was considered at both the cancellous bone-acrylic bone cement and bone cement-stem interfaces (represented using surface-to-surface Coulomb friction, coefficient of friction = 0.22) compared to when perfect bonding conditions were taken to exist at these interfaces. The significance of this finding, together with the study limitations, is discussed.

Title:The amino acid sequence Gly-Ala-Pro-Leu appears to be a fibrinogen binding site in the platelet integrin, glycoprotein IIb.
Authors:['Gartner TK', 'Taylor DB']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:The amino acid sequence Gly-Ala-Pro-Leu-Arg-Val is predicted by the anticomplementarity hypothesis to be a fibrinogen binding site on human platelet fibrinogen receptors. The peptide Ala-Pro-Leu-Arg-Val binds fibrinogen and inhibits platelet aggregation and clot retraction. The peptide Gly-Ala-Pro-Leu is the shortest sequence within the predicted sequence which potently inhibits the adhesion of platelets to fibrinogen and platelet aggregation. The sequence Gly-Ala-Pro-Leu is present as residues 309-312 in glycoprotein IIb, the alpha-subunit of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex, the fibrinogen receptor. The sequence Gly-Ala-Pro-Leu is present in 4 of 8 integrin alpha-subunits and Gly-Ala-Pro is present in 8 of 8 integrin alpha-subunits.

Title:Nicotine-induced norepinephrine release in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and amygdala is mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and nitric oxide in the nucleus tractus solitarius.

Abstract:The noradrenergic projections from brainstem nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) to hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and amygdala (AMYG) are involved in nicotine-related stress responses and drug craving. Previous studies demonstrated that i.v. nicotine-induced norepinephrine (NE) release in the PVN and AMYG depends on nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the brainstem. However, the direct site and mechanism of nicotine's action in brainstem are unknown. The present study determined the roles of NTS ionotropic glutamate receptors and nitric oxide (NO) in the effects of both local and systemic nicotine on NE release in PVN and AMYG. In male rats, an intra-NTS microinjection of nicotine (1.2 microg free base) or i.v. nicotine infusion (0.065 or 0.09 mg/kg) significantly increased NE levels in PVN and AMYG microdialysates. Prior microinjection of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, DL-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (0.75 or 1.5 microg), but not an alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor antagonist, dose dependently nearly abolished both PVN and AMYG NE responses to nicotine administered into NTS or systemically. NO involvement was assessed with intra-NTS microinjections of the nonselective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (10-30 nmol), or the NO scavenger, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (0.1-0.2 nmol); both agents dose dependently inhibited i.v. nicotine-induced NE release. These results indicate that nicotine-induced NE release in PVN and AMYG is mediated entirely through the local effects of nicotine on NTS glutamate afferents and NMDA receptors that, in part, stimulate NO production, resulting in activation of noradrenergic neurons. Therefore, nicotine acts indirectly on noradrenergic NTS neurons to elicit NE release in forebrain structures.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES: To examine race-specific differences in correlates of cessation in low income pregnant women. METHODS: Two hundred forty-eight low-income black and white pregnant women who smoked regularly prior to pregnancy were interviewed to assess several potential correlates of quitting. RESULTS: Race differences emerged in characteristics commonly thought to influence quitting including income, education level, marital status, nicotine dependence, and smoking history. However, race was not correlated with having quit smoking, nor did it influence the effect of other variables in quitting. CONCLUSIONS: Factors that influence the decision to quit smoking during pregnancy do not appear to differ between low-income black and white women.

Title:Food deprivation and the role of estradiol in mediating sexual behaviors in meadow voles.

Abstract:Female mammals are particularly sensitive to changes in food availability. The mechanisms that affect sexual behavior and food intake are closely related to one another; chief among the mechanisms that control sexual behaviors in females is estradiol. In order to understand how food deprivation results in inhibition of sexual behavior (attractivity, proceptivity, and receptivity), we measured the effects of food deprivation on circulating concentrations of estradiol. We also determined whether estradiol treatment was sufficient to restore sexual behaviors in food-deprived female meadow voles. We found that estradiol titers of food-deprived female voles are significantly lower than those of ad lib-fed female voles. Further, we found that estradiol treatment was sufficient to restore proceptivity and receptivity in food-deprived, ovariectomized female voles. However, estradiol treatment was not able to overcome the food deprivation-induced inhibition of attractivity. Thus, decreases in estradiol titer of food-deprived female voles may be related to the suppression of their proceptive and receptive behaviors, and may be a mechanism that allows females to avoid mating when conditions are not propitious for their survival and that of their offspring.

Title:The efficacy of personal construct therapy: a comprehensive review.
Authors:['Holland JM', 'Neimeyer RA', 'Currier JM', 'Berman JS']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Menphis, TN 38152, USA. jmhollnd@memphis.edu
Abstract:Prior narrative and quantitative reviews have suggested that personal construct therapy (PCT) is an efficacious and viable form of treatment. However, these reviews failed to include all published, controlled PCT outcome studies and did not account for all measures of outcome. The present quantitative review, therefore, offers a comprehensive integration of the 22 published studies that compare PCT to a control group, examining its overall efficacy at posttest and follow-up as well as its effects for different types of outcome measures. Overall, the efficacy of PCT was found to be somewhat weaker than that reported in previous reviews. It was also found that traditional self-report and behavioral observation measures tended to yield larger effects compared to measures that focused on personal meanings and scored content supplied by the client.

Abstract:PURPOSE: No previous research has tracked changes in teen sources for tobacco. Such information might help public health officials to target tobacco control efforts more precisely. This investigation used a two-year longitudinal design to determine (1) how adolescents' sources change and (2) whether the timing of smoking onset and duration of tobacco use predict the number and types of sources accessed. METHODS: A survey assessing usual sources of cigarettes and related variables was administered to 4461 seventh-graders annually. Of the target population, 79% provided baseline data, and 64.2% participated in all surveys. RESULTS: At baseline, 30% of the 1144 smokers got cigarettes from peers, compared with 11% using stores, 6% using vending machines, and 17% who stole them. Age of smoking onset did not predict the number or types of sources teens accessed. We did, however, find a significant effect of duration of smoking, showing that more practiced smokers were more likely to get cigarettes both from stores and from their friends. Further, the longer students smoked, the more likely they were to have friends who smoked. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the means through which teens got their first cigarettes were similar, regardless of when smoking onset occurred. In contrast, as teens became more established smokers, they increased the number of sources they used and relied more on both stores and peers. Once adolescents become smokers, they form a social network of fellow smokers who support their habit, making it even more difficult to quit.

Title:Chronic intermittent ethanol exposure during adolescence reduces the effect of ethanol challenge on hippocampal allopregnanolone levels and Morris water maze task performance.

Abstract:Chronic intermittent ethanol exposure (CIEE) in adolescent rats has been shown to produce long-lasting hypnotic, metabolic, and functional tolerance. Recently, it has been hypothesized that allopregnanolone mediates some effects of ethanol, including ethanol-induced impairments in the performance of the Morris Water Maze Task (MWMT). The current studies explore the relationship between cortical and hippocampal allopregnanolone levels and ethanol-induced impairments in the MWMT following CIEE treatment in adolescent rats. Adolescent rats were administered 5.0 g/kg ethanol or saline every 48 h for a 20-day period beginning on postnatal day (P) 30. Training in the spatial version of the MWMT occurred on nontreatment days. Following completion of CIEE treatment and training, MWMT performance was tested 30 min after ethanol (2.0 g/kg) or saline challenge on P 50 and P 62. A separate group of rats were CIEE treated and received an ethanol (2.0 g/kg) or saline challenge on P 50 or 62, and were used for hippocampal and cortical allopregnanolone determination. CIEE during adolescence produced tolerance to both ethanol-induced impairments in the MWMT and ethanol-induced allopregnanolone levels in the hippocampus on P 50. However, when animals were tested at P 62, the reduction in ethanol-induced MWMT impairments found in CIEE rats was reversed and allopregnanolone levels from both saline or ethanol challenge were increased above levels found in control animals. Taken together, these results suggest that CIEE during adolescence produces tolerance to ethanol-induced impairments in MWMT and corresponding changes in ethanol-induced allopregnanolone levels in the hippocampus. Furthermore, cognitive tolerance is reversible and time dependent, but the reversal of cognitive tolerance is not correlated with normalization of hippocampal allopregnanolone levels.

Title:Influence of the activator in an acrylic bone cement on an array of cement properties.

Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:In all but one of the acrylic bone cement brands used in cemented arthroplasties, N,N-dimethyl-4-toluidine (DMPT) serves as the activator of the polymerization reaction. However, many concerns have been raised about this activator, all related to its toxicity. Thus, various workers have assessed a number of alternative activators, with two examples being N,N-dimethylamino-4-benzyl laurate (DMAL) and N,N-dimethylamino-4-benzyl oleate (DMAO). The results of limited characterization of cements that contain DMAL or DMAO have been reported in the literature. The present work is a comprehensive comparison of cements that contain one of these three activators, in which the values of a large array of their properties were determined. These properties range from the setting time and maximum exotherm temperature of the curing cement to the variation of the loss elastic modulus of the cured cement with frequency of the applied indenting force in dynamic nanoindentation tests. The present results, taken in conjunction with those presented in previous reports by the present authors and co-workers on other properties of these cements, indicate that both DMAL and DMPT are suitable alternatives to DMPT.

Title:An introduced generalist parasite, the sticktight flea (Echidnophaga gallinacea), and its pathology in the threatened Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens).

Affiliation:Department of Biology University of Memphis Memphis Tennessee 38152, USA. rboughtn@memphis.edu
Abstract:The sticktight flea, (Echidnophaga gallinacea), a major pest of the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) that can cause severe pathology or death if untreated, is rarely recorded in free-living avian species. Sticktight fleas, however, were observed on the federally threatened Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) in February 2004, in south central Florida. Of the 81 Florida scrub-jays (FSJs) sampled before the 2004 breeding season, 12 were infested, with from 1 to as many as 57 fleas. Subsequent survivorship and variation in health indices led us to conclude that the sticktight flea caused the death of several jays. Within 4 mo, 46% of sticktight flea-infested (INF) jays died, whereas in the nonflea-infested (NINF) jays, only 5.9% died. Adult INF birds lost body mass in the time since a previous capture compared with NINF jays, and mass gain was slowed in 1-yr-old INF jays. Hematocrit of INF jays was dramatically impacted, as low as 17%, and was negatively correlated with the extent of infestation. Leukocyte counts were highest in INF jays; however, plasma immunoglobulin levels were lowest. Physiological stress levels, measured using plasma corticosterone, increased more rapidly in INF jays than NINF jays and were positively correlated with heterophil/lymphocyte ratios. The impact of the sticktight flea on the federally threatened FSJ negates previous findings that sticktight fleas are benign in wild avian hosts.

Title:Studies of thiol additions of silane coupling agents by vibrational spectroscopy.
Authors:['Li YS', 'Vecchio NE']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38138-3550, USA. yingli@memphis.edu
Abstract:Raman and infrared spectroscopies have been used to determine the addition reaction of mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) to allyltrimethoxysilane (ATMS) and 7-octenyltrichlorosilane based on the vibrational intensity variation of thiol and vinyl groups in the reaction mixtures. Due to the distinct and moderate intensity of Raman bands observed in the present experiment, the identification with Raman spectroscopic method is more sensitive than that with FTIR spectroscopy. In the presence of UV radiation, thiol addition reaction has been observed in the direct mixing samples of silanes. Hybrid sol-gels prepared with the use of MPTMS and ATMS as precursors in both acidic and basic conditions have revealed the progression of thiol addition under the UV radiation exposure. UV radiation is similarly effective to induce the thiol addition in the sol-gel coated aluminum tiles. Without UV radiation, the use of free radical initiator in the sol-gel samples might also help to induce the addition reaction.

Title:Sexual satisfaction and desire discrepancy in same sex women's relationships.
Authors:['Bridges SK', 'Horne SG']
Affiliation:Department of Counseling Psychology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:We explored desire discrepancy and sexual satisfaction among a sample of 1072 women in same-sex relationships. Results indicated that those who reported problematic desire discrepancy in the relationship had lower frequency of sexual contact and were less satisfied in their sexual relationships than both women who reported nonproblematic desire discrepancy and women with equal experiences of desire. In addition, problematic desire discrepancy was predictive of sexual dissatisfaction above and beyond other relationship factors. The findings suggest that caution should be taken when working with women in same sex relationships to avoid assumptions that discrepancy in desire is necessarily indicative of lower sexual satisfaction.

Title:The peptide Glu-His-Ile-Pro-Ala binds fibrinogen and inhibits platelet aggregation and adhesion to fibrinogen and vitronectin.
Authors:['Gartner TK', 'Taylor DB']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:Antiplatelet agents are clinically useful as antithrombotic entities. The importance of antiplatelet agents led us to design, synthesize, and characterize a new antiplatelet peptide. This peptide is a presumptive mimic of a ligand binding site on the platelet fibrinogen receptor. Unlike peptides related to Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser and His-His-Leu-Gly-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gln-Ala-Gly-Asp-Val that bind to the fibrinogen receptor, this peptide binds to fibrinogen. The anticomplementarity hypothesis was used to design this presumptive peptide mimic of the vitronectin binding site on the fibrinogen receptor, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complexes. The resulting peptide (Glu-His-Ile-Pro-Ala) has the characteristics of a fibrinogen binding site mimic: It binds fibrinogen and inhibits both the adhesion of platelets to fibrinogen and platelet aggregation. The peptide also inhibits the adhesion of platelets to vitronectin. The antiplatelet activity of this mimic peptide was dependent on its amino acid sequence, since closely related analogues were either inactive or less active inhibitors of platelet function than the original peptide. These results demonstrate that the peptide Glu-His-Ile-Pro-Ala has the characteristics expected of a mimic of a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa ligand binding site.

Abstract:Hierarchical linear Models (HLM) is a useful way to analyze the relationships between community level environmental data, individual risk factors, and birth outcomes. With HLM we can determine the effects of potentially remediable environmental conditions (e.g., air pollution) after controlling for individual characteristics such as health factors and socioeconomic factors. Methodological limitations of ecological studies of birth outcomes and a detailed analysis of the varying models that predict birth weight will be discussed. Ambient concentrations of criterion air pollutants (e.g., lead and sulfur dioxide) demonstrated a sizeable negative effect on birth weight; while the economic characteristics of the mother's residential census tract (ex. poverty level) also negatively influenced birth weight.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a risk factor for developing posttransplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) after liver transplantation; little is known about the biological mechanisms involved with this risk. This study investigated gene expression differences to provide insight into potential mechanisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of blood samples obtained from 6 HCV+ liver transplant recipients were determined using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Differential gene expression was assessed between HCV+ recipients with PTDM (n = 3) and without PTDM (n = 3) using the GeneSpring 7.3 software package. The Welch t test was used to identify significant differences (P < .05) between groups. Gene expression profiles for 6 HCV- liver transplant recipients (with PTDM = 3, without PTDM = 3) were used as a blind test set to evaluate a subset of genes to predict PTDM. RESULTS: Expression levels of 347 genes were significantly different between recipients with PTDM and those without PTDM. Seventy-four genes were up-regulated and 270 were down-regulated in PTDM. Genes were categorized into functional classes: apoptosis (n = 69 genes); immune function (n = 110); diabetes (n = 17); hepatitis C (n = 12); liver transplant (n = 69). The expression profile of a subset of genes was evaluated for predicting PTDM in 6 HCV- transplant recipients. We accurately predicted the presence or absence of PTDM in 5/6 recipients. CONCLUSIONS: PTDM in HCV+ liver transplant recipients was associated with down-regulated expression of a large number of genes. A subset of these genes was useful to predict PTDM in HCV- recipients. Most genes were associated with apoptosis and immune function. HCV may act as a primer by affecting a group of genes involved in developing diabetes.

Abstract:The purpose of this study is to identify physical and performance variables that discriminate elite American junior-aged men weightlifters from nonelite performers. Using a cross-sectional design, multiple discriminant analysis was used to determine field tests identifying elite male junior weightlifters. Young men who were participants (n = 115) at the Junior National and Junior Olympics Weightlifting Championships volunteered as subjects (mean +/- SD age = 14.8 +/- 2.3 years). Elite weightlifters (n = 20) were identified as the top 17.5% of national-level competitors when weightlifting performances were adjusted for body mass using the Sinclair equation. All other weightlifters were classified as nonelite (n = 95). Test batteries were performed immediately upon completion of a national-level weightlifting competition. Variables measured included easily-administered field tests of physical dimensions and body composition, muscular strength and power, flexibility, and gross motor control. The resulting regression equations correctly classified 84.35% of the weightlifters as elite or nonelite. Five variables significantly contributed to the discriminant analysis (Wilks Lambda = 0.6637392, chi(2) = 44.880, df = 5, p < 0.0001, adjusted R(2) = 0.67). Body mass index accounted for 23.13% of the total variance, followed by vertical jump (22.78%), relative fat (18.09%), grip strength (14.43%), and torso angle during an overhead squat (0.92%). The use of these 5 easily administered field tests is potentially useful as a screening tool for elite American junior men weightlifters.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: The Stroke Council of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) recommends conservative management of hypertension (HTN) during acute ischemic stroke (AIS), although clinicians often manage blood pressure more aggressively. Our hypothesis was that aggressive management of HTN in patients with AIS is associated with hypotensive events and worsened neurologic outcomes. METHODS: The study was a retrospective, observational cohort of patients who were admitted to the hospital with AIS. Classification of neurologic outcomes was based on nurses' neurologic assessments and were categorized as "worsened," "stayed the same," or "improved." The accuracy of these assessments was verified by review of physician's progress notes. Management of arterial HTN was recorded in all patients. RESULTS: Fifty medical records of patients with AIS who met inclusion criteria were reviewed. While only 22% of patients met the AHA/ASA criteria for hypertension treatment, 98% of the cohort were given antihypertensive therapy. Relative hypotension occurred in 64% of treated patients. Absolute hypotension associated with antihypertensive medications was uncommon but did occur in 2 of 15 patients who experienced neurologic worsening (13%), in 1 of 28 (3%) of patients who stayed the same, and in none of those who improved. Blood pressure was reduced excessively in all 11 of the patients who met AHA/ASA guidelines for treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to AHA/ASA guidelines for HTN management during AIS was poor. Initiation or intensification of antihypertensive drugs was not associated with worsened neurologic outcomes. Furthermore, relative hypotension, absolute hypotension and excessive reductions in blood pressure were not associated with worsened neurologic outcomes.

Abstract:PURPOSE: The purpose of the present work is to describe and illustrate the utility of a new tool for assessment of transcription agreement. Traditional measures have not characterized overall transcription agreement with sufficient resolution, specifically because they have often treated all phonetic differences between segments in transcriptions as equivalent, thus constituting an unweighted approach to agreement assessment. The measure the authors have developed calculates a weighted transcription agreement value based on principles derived from widely accepted tenets of phonological theory. METHOD: To investigate the utility of the new measure, 8 coders transcribed samples of speech and infant vocalizations. Comparing the transcriptions through a computer-based implementation of the new weighted and the traditional unweighted measures, they investigated the scaling properties of both. RESULTS: The results illustrate better scaling with the weighted measure, in particular because the weighted measure is not subject to the floor effects that occur with the traditional measure when applied to samples that are difficult to transcribe. Furthermore, the new weighted measure shows orderly relations in degree of agreement across coded samples of early canonical-stage babbling, early meaningful speech in English, and 3 adult languages. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that the weighted measure may provide improved foundations for research on phonetic transcription and for monitoring of transcription reliability.

Abstract:Neural stem cells and progenitor cells migrate selectively to tumor loci in vivo. We exploited the tumor-tropic properties of HB1.F3.C1 cells, an immortalized cell line derived from human fetal telencephalon, to deliver the cDNA encoding a secreted form of rabbit carboxylesterase (rCE) to disseminated neuroblastoma tumors in mice. This enzyme activates the prodrug CPT-11 more efficiently than do human enzymes. Mice bearing multiple tumors were treated with rCE-expressing HB1.F3.C1 cells and schedules of administration of CPT-11 that produced levels of active drug (SN-38) tolerated by patients. Both HB1.F3.C1 cells and CPT-11 were given i.v. None of the untreated mice and 30% of mice that received only CPT-11 survived long term. In contrast, 90% of mice treated with rCE-expressing HB1.F3.C1 cells and 15 mg/kg CPT-11 survived for 1 year without detectable tumors. Plasma carboxylesterase activity and SN-38 levels in mice receiving both rCE-expressing HB1.F3.C1 cells (HB1.F3.C1/AdCMVrCE) and CPT-11 were comparable with those in mice receiving CPT-11 only. These data support the hypothesis that the antitumor effect of the described neural stem/progenitor cell-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (NDEPT) is mediated by production of high concentrations of active drug selectively at tumor sites, thereby maximizing the antitumor effect of CPT-11. NDEPT approaches merit further investigation as effective, targeted therapy for metastatic tumors. We propose that the described approach may have greatest use for eradicating minimum residual disease.

Abstract:Stimulated B-lymphocytes differentiate into plasma cells committed to antibody production. Expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments is a prerequisite for high rate synthesis, assembly, and secretion of immunoglobulins. The bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulates murine B-cells to proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting cells that morphologically resemble plasma cells. LPS activation of CH12 B-cells augmented phospholipid production and initiated a genetic program, including elevated expression of the genes for the synthesis, elongation, and desaturation of fatty acids that supply the phospholipid acyl moieties. Likewise, many of the genes in phospholipid biosynthesis were up-regulated, most notably those encoding Lipin1 and choline phosphotransferase. In contrast, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase alpha (CCTalpha) protein, a key control point in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, increased because of stabilization of protein turnover rather than transcriptional activation. Furthermore, an elevation in cellular diacylglycerol and fatty acid correlated with enhanced allosteric activation of CCTalpha by the membrane lipids. This work defines a genetic and biochemical program for membrane phospholipid biogenesis that correlates with an increase in the phospholipid components of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments in LPS-stimulated B-cells.

Title:Different neural melatonin-target tissues are critical for encoding and retrieving day length information in Siberian hamsters.
Authors:['Teubner BJ', 'Freeman DA']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Siberian hamsters exhibit several seasonal rhythms in physiology and behaviour, including reproduction, energy balance, body mass, and pelage colouration. Unambiguous long- and short day lengths stimulate and inhibit reproduction, respectively. Whether gonadal growth or regression occurs in an intermediate day length (e.g. 14 h L : 10 h D; 14L), depends on whether the antecedent day lengths were shorter (10L) or longer (16L). Variations in day length are encoded by the duration of nocturnal pineal melatonin secretion, which is decoded at several neural melatonin target tissues to control testicular structure and function. We assessed participation of three such structures in the acquisition and retrieval of day length information. Elimination of melatonin signalling to the nucleus reuniens (NRe), but not to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) or paraventricular thalamus (PVt), interfered with the acquisition of a long day reproductive response, whereas the obscuring of melatonin signals to the SCN and the NRe, but not to the PVt, interfered with the photoperiod history response. The SCN and NRe contribute in different ways to the melatonin-based system that mediates seasonal rhythms in male reproduction.

Abstract:The present study considered the relation between adolescent gambling behavior and the perceived environment, the component of Jessor and Jessor's (1977) Problem Behavior Theory that assesses the ways that adolescents perceive the attitudes and behaviors of parents and peers. The predominantly African-American sample included 188 sophomores from two urban public high schools. Using the South Oaks Gambling Screen-Revised for Adolescents to assess gambling risk, rates of both at-risk (20.7%) and problem (12.8%) gambling were found to be high. Boys displayed more gambling problems than did girls. The perceived environment accounted for significant variance in gambling problems and frequency, with proximal components displaying stronger relationships than distal components. Perceiving parent gambling and friend models for problem behavior were positively correlated with gambling problems, and friend models were positively related to gambling frequency. Among girls, family support was positively related to gambling problems. Among boys, this relation was negative.

Title:Obligatory role for phospholipase C-gamma(1) in villin-induced epithelial cell migration.
Authors:['Wang Y', 'Tomar A', 'George SP', 'Khurana S']
Affiliation:Department of Physiology, The University of Tennessee, Health Science Center, Nash 402, 894 Union Ave., Memphis, TN 38163, USA.
Abstract:While there is circumstantial evidence to suggest a requirement for phospholipase C-gamma(1) (PLC-gamma(1)) in actin reorganization and cell migration, few studies have examined the direct mechanisms that link regulators of the actin cytoskeleton with this crucial signaling molecule. This study was aimed to examine the role that villin, an epithelial cell-specific actin-binding protein, and its ligand PLC-gamma(1) play in migration in intestinal and renal epithelial cell lines that endogenously or ectopically express human villin. Basal as well as epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated cell migration was accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of villin and its association with PLC-gamma(1). Inhibition of villin phosphorylation prevented villin-PLC-gamma(1) complex formation as well as villin-induced cell migration. The absolute requirement for PLC-gamma(1) in villin-induced cell migration was demonstrated by measuring cell motility in PLC-gamma(1)(-/-) cells and by downregulation of endogenous PLC-gamma(1). EGF-stimulated direct interaction of villin with the Src homology domain 2 domain of PLC-gamma(1) at the plasma membrane was demonstrated in living cells by using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. These results demonstrate that villin provides an important link between the activation of phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway and epithelial cell migration.

Title:Metalloproteases regulate T-cell proliferation and effector function via LAG-3.

Abstract:Tight control of T-cell proliferation and effector function is essential to ensure an effective but appropriate immune response. Here, we reveal that this is controlled by the metalloprotease-mediated cleavage of LAG-3, a negative regulatory protein expressed by all activated T cells. We show that LAG-3 cleavage is mediated by two transmembrane metalloproteases, ADAM10 and ADAM17, with the activity of both modulated by two distinct T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling-dependent mechanisms. ADAM10 mediates constitutive LAG-3 cleavage but increases approximately 12-fold following T-cell activation, whereas LAG-3 shedding by ADAM17 is induced by TCR signaling in a PKCtheta-dependent manner. LAG-3 must be cleaved from the cell surface to allow for normal T-cell activation as noncleavable LAG-3 mutants prevented proliferation and cytokine production. Lastly, ADAM10 knockdown reduced wild-type but not LAG-3(-/-) T-cell proliferation. These data demonstrate that LAG-3 must be cleaved to allow efficient T-cell proliferation and cytokine production and establish a novel paradigm in which T-cell expansion and function are regulated by metalloprotease cleavage with LAG-3 as its sole molecular target.

Title:Rapid and reliable biomechanical screening of injectable bone cements for autonomous augmentation of osteoporotic vertebral bodies: appropriate values of elastic constants for finite element models.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Xu J']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:We performed finite element analysis studies on 3 three-dimensional representations of a single vertebral body: a regular cube, made of low-density polyurethane foam (foam cube analog); a regular cube considered composed of cancellous bone only (bone cube analog)); and the body of the L2 vertebra (full anatomical body model). Each finite element model was subjected to a compressive load of 2300 N, uniformly distributed over its superior surface. The cancellous and cortical bones were assigned anisotropic elastic properties, while the foam and the endplate material were considered to have isotropic properties. In each representation, the elastic properties of the material(s) were adjusted (from the initial values that were used) to give a stiffness of the representation that was equal to that of the mean result for fresh cadaveric osteoporotic single vertebral bodies, as obtained from ex vivo experimental studies reported in the literature (1226 +/- 996 N mm(-1)). Thus, any one of these representations, when used with the final adjusted value(s) of the elastic constants and modified to include a cylindrical hole filled with a specific volume of bolus of an injected bone cement, may be utilized in the rapid and reliable experimental ex vivo and/or numerical screening of these cements for use in autonomous vertebral body augmentation. This approach has many advantages over those that are currently being used, which are either characterization of the cement in isolation from the vertebral body or use of cadaveric vertebral bodies.

Title:Influence of three variables on the stresses in a three-dimensional model of a proximal tibia-total knee implant construct.
Authors:['Sarathi Kopparti P', 'Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Chemical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:A finite element analysis of the stresses in a three-dimensional model of the proximal human tibia containing the tibial components (insert, tray, and stem) of a cemented total knee joint replacement was conducted. 12 cases of this model, covering three variables (composition of applied loading, interface conditions, and assignment of elastic properties to the cortical and cancellous bones) were analyzed. It was found that the stresses in various parts of the model were markedly lower when (a) the applied load comprised a compressive joint reaction force (F), of 2 kN, only (quadriceps inactive) versus F+ a patellar ligament force of 1.46 kN (P), representing the situation when the quadriceps are active; and (b) the interfaces were considered fully bonded compared to when they represented as having surface-to-surface Coulomb frictional contact (coefficient of friction = 0.2). However, the nature of the elastic properties that were assigned to the bones (isotropic versus anisotropic) had only a marginal influence on the stresses.

Title:Exogenous T3 mimics long day lengths in Siberian hamsters.
Authors:['Freeman DA', 'Teubner BJ', 'Smith CD', 'Prendergast BJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-3540, USA. dfreemn1@memphis.edu
Abstract:Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exhibit seasonal cycles of reproduction driven by changes in day length. Day length is encoded endogenously by the duration of nocturnal melatonin (Mel) secretion from the pineal gland. Short-duration Mel signals stimulate reproduction and long-duration signals inhibit reproduction. The mechanism by which Mel signals are decoded at the level of neural target tissues remains uncharacterized. In Siberian hamsters, exposure to short day lengths or injections of Mel in long days results in a decrease in hypothalamic expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) mRNA. Dio2 catalyzes the conversion of the thyroid hormone thyroxine to triiodothyronine (T3). Thus exposure to short and long day lengths should decrease and increase hypothalamic T3 concentrations, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that exogenous T3 administered to short-day hamsters would mimic exposure to long day lengths with respect to gonadal stimulation. Hamsters gestated and raised in short day lengths that exhibited photoinhibition of the testes were given daily subutaneous injections of T3 or saline vehicle for 4 wk beginning at week 12 of life. The results indicate that exogenous T3 induced gonadal growth in short-day hamsters and delayed spontaneous gonadal development by an interval equal to the number of weeks during which T3 was administered. T3 injections delayed gonadal regression if given coincident with the transfer of hamsters from long to short day lengths. These results suggest that T3 mimics long day exposure in Siberian hamsters and may serve as an intermediate step between the Mel rhythm and the reproductive response.

Title:The stability of radio-frequency plasma-treated polydimethylsiloxane surfaces.
Authors:['Chen IJ', 'Lindner E']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, 330 Engineering Technology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a widely used material for manufacturing lab-on-chip devices. However, the hydrophobic nature of PDMS is a disadvantage in microfluidic systems. To transform the hydrophobic PDMS surface to hydrophilic, it was treated with radio-frequency (RF) air plasma at 150, 300, and 500 mTorr pressures for up to 30 min. Following the surface treatment, the PDMS specimens were stored in air, deionized water, or 0.14 M NaCl solution at 4 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 70 degrees C. The change in the hydrophilicity (wettability) of the PDMS surfaces was followed by contact angle measurements and Fourier transform infrared attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy as a function of time. As an effect of the RF plasma treatment, the contact angles measured on PDMS surfaces dropped from 113 +/- 4 degrees to 9 +/- 3 degrees . The chamber pressure and the treatment time had no or negligible effect on the results. However, the PDMS surface gradually lost its hydrophilic properties in time. The rate of this process is influenced by the difference in the dielectric constants of the PDMS and its ambient environment. It was the smallest at low temperatures in deionized water and largest at high temperatures in air. Apparently, the OH groups generated on the PDMS surface during the plasma treatment tended toward a more hydrophilic/less hydrophobic environment during the relaxation processes. The correlation between the FTIR-ATR spectral information and the contact angle data supports this interpretation.

Title:Hydrodynamic interaction in polymer solutions simulated with dissipative particle dynamics.
Authors:['Jiang W', 'Huang J', 'Wang Y', 'Laradji M']
Affiliation:Chemistry Department, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-3390, USA.
Abstract:The authors analyzed extensively the dynamics of polymer chains in solutions simulated with dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), with a special focus on the potential influence of a low Schmidt number of a typical DPD fluid on the simulated polymer dynamics. It has been argued that a low Schmidt number in a DPD fluid can lead to underdevelopment of the hydrodynamic interaction in polymer solutions. The authors' analyses reveal that equilibrium polymer dynamics in dilute solution, under typical DPD simulation conditions, obey the Zimm [J. Chem. Phys. 24, 269 (1956)] model very well. With a further reduction in the Schmidt number, a deviation from the Zimm model to the Rouse model is observed. This implies that the hydrodynamic interaction between monomers is reasonably developed under typical conditions of a DPD simulation. Only when the Schmidt number is further reduced, the hydrodynamic interaction within the chains becomes underdeveloped. The screening of the hydrodynamic interaction and the excluded volume interaction as the polymer volume fraction is increased are well reproduced by the DPD simulations. The use of soft interaction between polymer beads and a low Schmidt number do not produce noticeable problems for the simulated dynamics at high concentrations, except for the entanglement effect which is not captured in the simulations.

Title:Soluble tubulin complexes, gamma-tubulin, and their changing distribution in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) ovary, oocyte and embryo.
Authors:['Liu J', 'Lessman CA']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-3560, USA.
Abstract:Tubulin dynamics, i.e., the interchange of polymeric and soluble forms, is important for microtubule (MTs) cellular functions, and thus plays essential roles in zebrafish oogenesis and embryogenesis. A novel finding in this study revealed that there were soluble pools of tubulins in zebrafish oocytes that were sequestered and maintained in a temporary "oligomeric" state, which retained assembling and disassembling potential (suggested by undetected acetylated tubulin, marker of stable tubulin), but lacked abilities to assemble into MTs spontaneously in vivo. Using differential centrifugation, gel chromatography and DM1A-probed western blot, soluble alpha-tubulin was found to be associated with large molecular weight complexes (MW range to over 2 MDa) which were reduced in amount by the blastula stage, especially in some batches of embryos, with a concomitant decrease in soluble tubulin. Complexes (MW range less than 2 MDa) then increased in the gastrula with an increase in soluble alpha-tubulin. Two different anti-gamma-tubulin monoclonal antibodies, GTU 88 and TU 30, revealed the existence of soluble gamma-tubulin in both zebrafish oocytes and embryos, which also decreased by the blastula stage and increased in the gastrula stage. Soluble alpha-tubulin and gamma-tubulin extracted from zebrafish ovaries, oocytes and embryos co-localized in fractions on three different columns: S-200 Sephacryl, DEAE and Superose-6b. The soluble tubulin complexes were competent to assemble into MTs in vitro induced by taxol, and gamma-tubulin was co-localized with assembled MTs. These soluble tubulin complexes were stable during freeze-thaw cycles and resisted high ionic interaction (up to 1.5 M NaCl). Furthermore, some ovarian soluble alpha-tubulin could be co-immunoprecipitated with gamma-tubulin, and vice versa. Two antibodies specific for Xenopus gamma-tubulin ring complex proteins (Xgrip 109 and Xgrip 195) detected single bands from ovarian extracts in western blots, suggesting the existence of Xgrip 109 and Xgrip 195 homologues in zebrafish. These findings, together with recent work on gamma-tubulin ring complexes in oocytes, eggs and embryos of other species, suggest that soluble gamma-tubulin-associated protein complexes may be involved in regulating tubulin dynamics during zebrafish oogenesis and embryogenesis.

Abstract:This study examined the effect of chitosan degree of deacetylation (DDA), concentration of simulated body fluid (SBF), and mineralization time on the composition, structure, and crystallinity of calcium phosphate (CaP) biomimetically deposited on chitosan and on osteoblast cell growth. Phosphorylated chitosan films of 92.3%, 87.4%, and 80.6% DDA were soaked in SBF (1.0x or 1.5x) for 7, 14, or 21 days. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that CaP precipitated from 1.5x SBF had a porous, granular morphology; while the coatings precipitated in 1.0x SBF were smoother and more uniform. X-ray diffraction showed that films mineralized in 1.0x SBF were amorphous, while films mineralized in 1.5x SBF for 21 days exhibited crystalline peaks similar to hydroxyapatite, with the most crystalline peaks seen on 92.3% DDA chitosan. When mineralized films were placed in cell media for 14 days, more calcium phosphate precipitated onto all films, and the most calcium phosphate was found on 92.3% DDA films mineralized in 1.5x SBF. After seven days of osteoblast culture, there were approximately three times as many cells (based on DNA measurements, p < 0.05) on 92.3% DDA films soaked in 1.0x SBF for seven or 21 days than on 80.6% DDA films soaked in 1.0x SBF for any length of time or any films soaked in 1.5x SBF. The DDA of chitosan, concentration of SBF and mineralization time affect the structure of and biological response to chitosan/biomimetic CaP films, and these factors must be considered when designing new materials to be used in orthopaedic and dental/craniofacial implant applications.

Abstract:Interleukin (IL)-6 induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) motility in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, IL-6 stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130, resulting in the recruitment and activation of STAT-3. IL-6-induced VSMC motility was found to be dependent on activation of gp130/STAT-3 signaling. IL-6 also induced cyclin D1 expression in a time- and gp130/STAT-3-dependent manner in VSMCs. Suppression of cyclin D1 levels via the use of its small interfering RNA molecules inhibited IL-6-induced VSMC motility. Furthermore, balloon injury induced IL-6 expression both at mRNA and protein levels in rat carotid artery. Balloon injury also caused increased STAT-3 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 expression, leading to smooth muscle cell migration from the media to the intimal region. Blockade of gp130/STAT-3 signaling via adenovirus-mediated expression of dngp130 or dnSTAT-3 attenuated balloon injury-induced STAT-3 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 induction, resulting in reduced smooth muscle cell migration from media to intima and decreased neointima formation. Together, these observations for the first time suggest that IL-6/gp130/STAT-3 signaling plays an important role in vascular wall remodeling particularly in the settings of postangioplasty and thereby in neointima formation.

Abstract:The current study was an exploration of gambling-related perceptions and their relation to gambling behavior among young adult college students. Three hundred and two ethnically diverse undergraduates at a large urban public university completed a survey to assess their perceptions of the availability, risks, and benefits of gambling, and the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) to assess gambling behavior and problems. Participants generally rated gambling as more available than alcohol or marijuana, and less risky than alcohol or cigarettes. The most common perceived benefits of gambling were social enhancement, financial gain, and positive changes in affect. Perceived benefits were a significant predictor of gambling problems. Perceived availability, perceived risk, and perceived benefits were found to be significant predictors of regular gambling. These results provide valuable information about the ways that college students perceive gambling and demonstrate that perceptions can be important predictors of gambling behavior.

Affiliation:University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:The objective of this research was to investigate stress-signaling patterns in response to two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) calcium phosphate (CP) materials using human embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells (HEPM, CRL-1486, ATCC, Manassas, VA), an osteoblast precursor cell line. Control discs and scaffolds were fabricated from hydroxyapatite and beta tri-CP ceramics. Phospho-specific antibody cell-based ELISA technique was utilized on members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade including; the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the anti-apoptosis mediator protein kinase B (AKT). Quantification of these signals was evaluated during the early attachment phase of osteoblast precursor cells. In this study, it was observed that 3-D CP scaffolds significantly activated the stress mediators p38 and JNK but not ERK1/2. This signal trend was matched with an up-regulation in AKT, suggesting the ability of cells to manage high stress signals in response to 3-D CP architecture and that 3-D CP scaffolds are necessary for studies simulating a natural trabecular bone organization. The absence of these signals in 2-D CP surfaces indicated the importance of local architecture conditions on cell stress response. It was concluded from this study that osteoblast precursor cells cultured in 3-D CP scaffolds experience greater stress-signaling patterns when compared to 2-D CP surfaces.

Abstract:PROCEDURE: Much research is directed at surface modifications to enhance osseointegration of implants. A new potential coating is the biopolymer, chitosan, the deacetylated derivative of the natural polysaccharide, chitin. Chitosan is biocompatible, degradable, nontoxic, and exhibits osteogenic properties. The aim of this research was to investigate the hypothesis that chitosan-coated titanium supports bone formation and osseointegration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chitosan (1 wt% of 92.3% deacetylated chitosan in 1% acetic acid) was solution cast and bonded to rough ground titanium pins (2-mm diameterx4-mm long) via silane reactions. Calcium phosphate sputter-coated titanium and uncoated titanium pins were used as controls. Two chitosan-coated pins, and 1 each of calcium phosphate coated and uncoated pins were implanted unilaterally in the tibia of 16 adult male New Zealand white rabbits. At 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, undecalcified sections were histologically evaluated for healing and bone formation. RESULTS: Histological evaluations of tissues in contact with the chitosan-coated pins indicated minimal inflammatory response and a typical healing sequence of fibrous, woven bone formation, followed by development of lamellar bone. These observations were similar to those for tissues interfacing the control calcium phosphate-coated and uncoated titanium implants. Quantitative comparisons of the bone-implant interface were not possible since 31% of the implants migrated into the tibial marrow space after implantation due to insufficient cortical bone thickness to hold pins in place during healing. CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that chitosan-coatings are able to develop a close bony apposition or the osseointegration of dental/craniofacial and orthopedic implants.

Title:Physical work-induced oxidative stress is exacerbated in young cigarette smokers.

Abstract:Both cigarette smoking and strenuous physical work are associated with increased oxidative stress, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. No study to date has measured oxidative stress in response to graded exercise in cigarette smokers. We compared oxidative stress biomarkers before and after strenuous exercise (Bruce treadmill protocol) in 14 cigarette smokers and 15 nonsmokers of similar age (24+/-6 years) and fitness status. Plasma protein carbonyls (PC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured pre- and postexercise. Smoking status (p<.01) and time (p<.01) effects were noted for PC with values higher for smokers than nonsmokers and increasing from pre- to postexercise (52% vs. 25%, respectively). The smoking statusxtime interaction for PC approached statistical significance (p=.07). The change in PC from pre- to postexercise was positively correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked per day (r=.5782, p=.03). A smoking statusxtime interaction was noted for MDA (p<.01), with values increasing 37% from pre- (0.6140+/-0.0708 micromol/L) to postexercise (0.8440+/-0.0687 micromol/L) for smokers and remaining relatively unchanged for nonsmokers (from 0.7664+/-0.0901 to 0.7419+/-0.0776 micromol/L). 8-OHdG was unaffected by smoking status (p=.43) or exercise (p=.40). These findings indicate that young cigarette smokers experience an exaggerated oxidative stress response to strenuous physical work, compared with nonsmokers of similar age. These results highlight yet another detrimental impact of cigarette smoking on human health. Future investigations should focus on older, more established smokers.

Abstract:The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that there is one model for the interface between the passive layer on the surface of an orthopaedic alloy and an electrolyte that has clinical relevance. To this end, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were made on mechanically-polished test specimens fabricated from three orthopaedic alloys [two Ti-based ones (Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-13Nb-13Zr) and a very-low-nickel austenitic stainless steel, Biodur 108] while they were immersed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, at 37+/-1 degrees C, over a period of 25 d. Through a statistical comparison between the experimental results (Nyquist and Bode plots) and those computed using seven different equivalent electrical circuits (each representing a different model of the aforementioned interface), it was found that one circuit (comprising an arrangement of three resistances and three capacitances in series with a resistor representing the solution resistance) provided the best-fit in all three alloy surface-PBS solution systems, thus providing support for the working hypothesis. The variation of each of the circuit elements with time of immersion of the specimen in the PBS solution and the study limitation are discussed.

Abstract:Carboxylesterases (CE) are ubiquitous enzymes thought to be responsible for the metabolism and detoxification of xenobiotics. Numerous clinically used drugs including Demerol, lidocaine, capecitabine, and CPT-11 are hydrolyzed by these enzymes. Hence, the identification and application of selective CE inhibitors may prove useful in modulating the metabolism of esterified drugs in vivo. Having recently identified benzil (diphenylethane-1,2-dione) as a potent selective inhibitor of CEs, we sought to evaluate the inhibitory activity of related 1,2-diones toward these enzymes. Biochemical assays and kinetic studies demonstrated that isatins (indole-2,3-diones), containing hydrophobic groups attached at a variety of positions within these molecules, could act as potent, specific CE inhibitors. Interestingly, the inhibitory potency of the isatin compounds was related to their hydrophobicity, such that compounds with clogP values of <1.25 were ineffective at enzyme inhibition. Conversely, analogs demonstrating clogP values>5 routinely yielded Ki values in the nM range. Furthermore, excellent 3D QSAR correlates were obtained for two human CEs, hCE1 and hiCE. While the isatin analogues were generally less effective at CE inhibition than the benzils, the former may represent valid lead compounds for the development of inhibitors for use in modulating drug metabolism in vivo.

Abstract:We have synthesized and assessed the ability of symmetrical fluorobenzoins and fluorobenzils to inhibit mammalian carboxylesterases (CE). The majority of the latter were excellent inhibitors of CEs however unexpectedly, the fluorobenzoins were very good enzyme inhibitors. Positive correlations were seen with the charge on the hydroxyl carbon atom, the carbonyl oxygen, and the Hammett constants for the derived K(i) values with the fluorobenzoins.

Abstract:One strategy that has been suggested for reducing the operating room time for cemented total joint arthroplasties-and, hence, for reducing the total cost of these procedures-is to accelerate the polymerization of the acrylic bone cement by preheating the powder to 65 degrees C. We quantified the effect of preheating the cement powders on the fracture toughness and fatigue life of 3 cement brands that are widely used in clinical practice. The results suggest judicious selection of cements whose powders are to be preheated for use in cemented arthroplasties.

Title:The economic implications of the racial and ethnic disparities in the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have examined racial and ethnic disparities in the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). This study aims to examine the economic implications of these disparities. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, the study sample was adult survey respondents with a diagnosis of depression from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2002-2003). SSRI use was measured as the number of times when SSRIs were obtained. The racial and ethnic disparities in SSRI use were examined employing a negative binomial model. The economic implications of disparities were explored using a linear regression with SSRI use as an independent variable. Interaction terms between the variable for SSRI use and dummy variables for racial and ethnic groups were included to explore whether the relationships between SSRI use and health expenditures differ across racial and ethnic groups. RESULTS: The mean number of times of SSRI use was higher for non-Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic blacks (3.02 vs. 1.79; p < 0.05) and Hispanic whites (3.02 vs. 1.68; p < 0.05). These differences were still significant after adjusting for covariates (p < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, each time of SSRI use was associated with health expenditures of $301 higher. Neither dummy variables for racial and ethnic groups nor the interaction terms between these dummy variables and the variable for SSRI use were significant. CONCLUSIONS: The lower use of SSRIs among minorities compared to non-Hispanic whites is associated with lower health expenditures among minorities. SSRI may be a proxy for improved access to health care due to under-treatment of depression in general. The main limitation of this study is that its observational nature does not allow the researchers to determine whether the association between SSRI use and the increase in health expenditures is a causal effect.

Affiliation:Department of Physics, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-3390, USA.
Abstract:Polymer solutions subject to pressure driven flow and in nanoscale slit pores are systematically investigated using the dissipative particle dynamics approach. The authors investigated the effect of molecular weight, polymer concentration, and flow rate on the profiles across the channel of the fluid and polymer velocities, polymer density, and the three components of the polymers radius of gyration. They found that the mean streaming fluid velocity decreases as the polymer molecular weight and/or polymer concentration is increased, and that the deviation of the velocity profile from the parabolic profile is accentuated with increase in polymer molecular weight or concentration. They also found that the distribution of polymers conformation is highly anisotropic and nonuniform across the channel. The polymer density profile is also found to be nonuniform, exhibiting a local minimum in the center plane followed by two symmetric peaks. They found a migration of the polymer chains either from or toward the walls. For relatively long chains, as compared to the thickness of the slit, a migration toward the walls is observed. However, for relatively short chains, a migration away from the walls is observed.

Abstract:The present study investigated social influence and selection explanations for the association between frequency of heavy drinking and perceived peer alcohol involvement in emerging and early adulthood. Participants were 489 young adults recruited from a university setting who were taking part in an 11-year longitudinal study, which includes 6 waves of data. Piecewise latent growth curve analyses indicated that patterns of change from ages 18 to 30 for both frequency of heavy drinking and perceived peer alcohol involvement are best represented by two distinct developmental periods (i.e., college and post-college years). Several models were compared to identify a framework that yielded the best estimates of influence and selection effects. Evidence suggests that selection mechanisms may best account for the relation between frequency of heavy drinking and perceived peer alcohol involvement especially during the post-college years.

Abstract:The function of the orphan glutamate receptor delta subunits (GluRdelta1 and GluRdelta2) remains unclear. GluRdelta2 is expressed exclusively in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, and GluRdelta1 is prominently expressed in inner ear hair cells and neurons of the hippocampus. We found that mice lacking the GluRdelta1 protein displayed significant cochlear threshold shifts for frequencies of >16 kHz. These deficits correlated with a substantial loss of type IV spiral ligament fibrocytes and a significant reduction of endolymphatic potential in high-frequency cochlear regions. Vulnerability to acoustic injury was significantly enhanced; however, the efferent innervation of hair cells and the classic efferent inhibition of outer hair cells were unaffected. Hippocampal and vestibular morphology and function were normal. Our findings show that the orphan GluRdelta1 plays an essential role in high-frequency hearing and ionic homeostasis in the basal cochlea, and the locus encoding GluRdelta1 represents a candidate gene for congenital or acquired high-frequency hearing loss in humans.

Title:Exogenous melatonin administration affects self-grooming and conspecific odor preferences in long-photoperiod meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus).

Affiliation:Department of Biology, Ellington Hall, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-6080, USA. mhferkin@memphis.edu
Abstract:For meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, seasonal differences exist in self-grooming and in odor preferences for conspecifics, two behaviors which facilitate sexual interactions in this species. Both behaviors are mediated by photoperiodically-induced changes in circulating gonadal steroid hormone titers which, in turn, can be transduced by the duration of the melatonin signal that a seasonally breeding animal receives. The goal of this study was to determine whether exogenous melatonin administration affects circulating gonadal steroid hormone titers in meadow voles, and whether it influences their odor preferences and self-grooming behavior to same- and opposite-sex conspecifics. Long-photoperiod voles that did not receive exogenous melatonin had higher testosterone (males) and estradiol (females) titers than did short-photoperiod voles and long-photoperiod voles treated with melatonin for 12 weeks; the latter had similar estradiol and testosterone titers. Long-photoperiod voles that did not receive melatonin preferred the scent marks of long-photoperiod opposite-sex conspecifics and spent more time self-grooming in response to their odors than those of either long-photoperiod same-sex, short-photoperiod same-sex, or short-photoperiod opposite-sex conspecifics. Long-photoperiod voles that received melatonin, however, no longer preferred the marks of long-photoperiod opposite-sex conspecifics and no longer spent more time self-grooming in response to their odors, not unlike the odor preferences and self-grooming behavior of short-photoperiod voles. As a whole, the data suggest that the duration of the melatonin signal is likely involved in mediating the photoperiodically-induced changes in gonadal steroid hormones that mediate a meadow vole's odor preferences for opposite-sex conspecifics and its self-grooming response to those marks.

Abstract:The Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway is indispensable for development, and functions to activate a transcriptional program modulated by the GLI transcription factors. Here, we report that loss of a regulator of the SHH pathway, Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), resulted in early embryonic lethality in the mouse similar to inactivation of another SHH regulator, Patched1 (Ptch1). In contrast to Ptch1+/- mice, Sufu+/- mice were not tumor prone. However, in conjunction with p53 loss, Sufu+/- animals developed tumors including medulloblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma. Tumors present in Sufu+/-p53-/- animals resulted from Sufu loss of heterozygosity. Sufu+/-p53-/- medulloblastomas also expressed a signature gene expression profile typical of aberrant SHH signaling, including upregulation of N-myc, Sfrp1, Ptch2 and cyclin D1. Finally, the Smoothened inhibitor, hedgehog antagonist, did not block growth of tumors arising from Sufu inactivation. These data demonstrate that Sufu is essential for development and functions as a tumor suppressor.

Title:MicroRNA expression signature and antisense-mediated depletion reveal an essential role of MicroRNA in vascular neointimal lesion formation.
Authors:['Ji R', 'Cheng Y', 'Yue J', 'Yang J', 'Liu X', 'Chen H', 'Dean DB', 'Zhang C']

Abstract:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered class of endogenous, small, noncoding RNAs that regulate about 30% of the encoding genes of the human genome. However, the role of miRNAs in vascular disease is currently completely unknown. Using microarray analysis, we demonstrated for the first time that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in the vascular walls after balloon injury. The aberrantly expressed miRNAs were further confirmed by Northern blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Modulating an aberrantly overexpressed miRNA, miR-21, via antisense-mediated depletion (knock-down) had a significant negative effect on neointimal lesion formation. In vitro, the expression level of miR-21 in dedifferentiated vascular smooth muscle cells was significantly higher than that in fresh isolated differentiated cells. Depletion of miR-21 resulted in decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. MiR-21-mediated cellular effects were further confirmed in vivo in balloon-injured rat carotid arteries. Western blot analysis demonstrated that PTEN and Bcl-2 were involved in miR-21-mediated cellular effects. The results suggest that miRNAs are novel regulatory RNAs for neointimal lesion formation. MiRNAs may be a new therapeutic target for proliferative vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, postangioplasty restenosis, transplantation arteriopathy, and stroke.

Title:Measuring the force production of the hormogonia of Mastigocladus laminosus.
Authors:['Robinson WB', 'Mealor AE', 'Stevens SE Jr', 'Ospeck M']
Affiliation:Physics Department, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:The cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus forms hormogonia, which glide slowly away from the parent colony by extruding slime out of nozzles. Using video microscopy, we observed hormogonia embedded in and moving through 1-4% agar solutions with an average velocity of 0.5 microm/s. Agar is non-Newtonian and is subject to shear-thinning so that its viscosity greatly increases at low shear rates. We measured the viscosity of these agar solutions at the very low shear rates appropriate for gliding hormogonia and found it to vary from 1 to 52 million centipoise. Then, by applying a Newtonian drag coefficient for a 100-microm-long, cigar-shaped hormogonium, we found that it produced a force of several million pN. A typical hormogonium has 10-100 thousand 9-nm-wide slime extrusion nozzles. Wolgemuth et al. have proposed hydration-driven swelling of the polyelectrolyte slime ejected from these nozzles as the force production mechanism, and our experiment found a large nozzle force that was consistent with this hypothesis. Average single nozzle force depended on viscosity, being large when the viscosity was high: 71 pN in 3% and 126 pN in 4% agar.

Title:Influence of two changes in the composition of an acrylic bone cement on its handling, thermal, physical, and mechanical properties.

Abstract:This study is a contribution to the growing body of work on the influence of changes in the composition of an acrylic bone cement on various properties of the curing and cured material. The focus is on one commercially-available acrylic bone cement brand, Surgical Simplex P, and three variants of it and a series of properties, namely, setting time, maximum exotherm temperature, activation energy and frequency factor for the polymerization reaction, diffusion coefficient for the uptake of phosphate buffered saline, at 37 degrees C, ultimate compressive strength (UCS), plane-strain fracture toughness, fatigue life (under fully-reversed tension-compression stress), hardness (H) and elastic modulus (both determined using quasi-static nanoindentation), and the variation of the storage and loss moduli with frequency of the applied force in a dynamic nanoindentation test. It was found that (a) a 68% reduction in the volume of the activator, N,N dimethyl-4-toluidine, relative to the total volume of the liquid monomer (the amounts of all the constituents in the powder and of the hydroquinone in the liquid monomer remaining unchanged) led to, for example, a significant decrease in the rate of the polymerization reaction, at 37 degrees C (c') and a significant increase in H; and (b) the elimination of the pre-polymerized poly (methyl methacrylate) beads in the powder (the amounts of all the other powder constituents and those of the liquid monomer remaining unchanged) led to, for example, a significant drop in c' and a significant increase in UCS. Thus, these findings suggest a strategy for optimizing the composition of an acrylic bone cement.

Abstract:Grief therapies with children are becoming increasingly popular in the mental health community. Nonetheless, questions persist about how well these treatments actually help with children's adjustment to the death of a loved one. This study used meta-analytic techniques to evaluate the general effectiveness of bereavement interventions with children. A thorough quantitative review of the existing controlled outcome literature (n = 13) yielded a conclusion akin to earlier reviews of grief therapy with adults, namely that the child grief interventions do not appear to generate the positive outcomes of other professional psychotherapeutic interventions. However, studies that intervened in a time-sensitive manner and those that implemented specific selection criteria produced better outcomes than investigations that did not attend to these factors.

Abstract:The H5N1 virus currently circulating is continuing to evolve, and it has already resulted in the extension of its host and geographical range. It is likely that H5N1 will become a global problem for the poultry industry. How many of the recent H5N1 changes observed have been induced by changing patterns in poultry raising? A change in attitude on the use of high-quality vaccines is a change that would drastically help in the control of the current epidemic in the poultry industry. This article provides an overview of the changing properties that have been observed during the current H5N1 outbreaks.

Title:Personality, hearing problems, and amplification characteristics: contributions to self-report hearing aid outcomes.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC', 'Gray GA']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. robyncox@memphis.edu
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: When we evaluate the success of a hearing aid fitting, or the effectiveness of new amplification technology, self-report data occupy a position of critical importance. Unless patients report that our efforts are helpful, it is difficult to justify a conclusion that the intervention has been successful. Although it is generally assumed that subjective reports primarily reflect the excellence of the fitted hearing aid(s) within the context of the patient's everyday circumstances, there is relatively little research that assesses the validity of this assumption. In previous work, we have reported some contributions of the service delivery setting (private practice versus public health) to self-report outcomes. The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the relative contributions of patient variables (such as personality and hearing problems) and amplification variables (such as soft sound audibility, gain and maximum output) to self-reports of hearing aid fitting outcomes. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey of 205 patients was conducted with cooperation of eleven Audiology clinics. All subjects were recruited when they were seeking new hearing aids. Before the hearing aid fitting, measurements of personality and response bias were made, as well as measures of hearing problems and expectations about amplification. At the fitting, traditional verification data were measured including sound field thresholds, preferred gain for conversation, and maximum output. Six months after the fitting, a set of 12 standardized self-report outcomes was completed. Analyses concerned: (1) the associations among personality, response bias, and self-reports about hearing problems that are available before the hearing aid fitting, and (2) the associations of these precursor variables, and fitting verification data, with self-report data assessing the outcome of hearing aid provision. RESULTS: Self-reports of hearing problems, sound aversiveness, and hearing aid expectations obtained before the fitting were found to be more closely related to the strength of certain personality traits than to audiometric hearing loss. Response bias also was associated with personality variables. Analyses of the collection of outcome measures produced a set of three components that were interpreted as a Device component, a Success component, and an Acceptance component. The Device component was construed as reflecting characteristics of the hearing aid whereas the two other components were construed as reflecting attributes of the wearer. The Success and Acceptance components were each significantly associated with several personality traits, but the Device component was not associated with personality. Variables available before the fitting accounted for 20 to 30% of each outcome component whereas amplification variables measured to verify the fitting accounted for only 10% on only one component. CONCLUSIONS: As reported in previous research, personality is associated with self-report outcome data. However, if practitioners utilize existing measures of hearing problems at the prefitting stage, separate personality data will not yield additional leverage in prediction of long-term fitting outcomes. Traditional fitting verification data as measured in this study, proved minimally useful in prediction of long-term outcomes of the fitting. A large proportion of variance in self-report fitting outcomes has yet to be accounted for. Finally, it appears that certain types of questionnaires might be more appropriate for research evaluating new amplification devices, whereas a different questionnaire approach might be optimal for evaluating intervention effectiveness in a clinical context.

Title:Corticosterone administration does not affect timing of breeding in Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens).

Abstract:Providing supplemental food to Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) causes a reliable advance in clutch initiation of 1 to 2 weeks. In some years, supplemental food appeared to not only advance laying date but also decrease baseline concentrations of corticosterone (CORT) relative to controls. The coincidence of low CORT levels and early breeding led us to hypothesize that CORT serves to communicate information about environmental conditions to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which ultimately influences the timing of breeding. To test this hypothesis, we administered small oral doses of CORT three times each day to female breeders that were provisioned with supplemental food. We compared clutch initiation dates of the CORT-dosed females to females with supplementation but no exogenous CORT and to females with neither CORT nor supplemental food. CORT administration had a strong temporary effect on circulating CORT concentrations but clutch initiation did not differ between the two groups of supplemented birds, both of which laid eggs approximately 10 days earlier than nonsupplemented birds. Furthermore, during the year of our study we found no reduction in baseline CORT concentrations in our undosed supplemental groups, as had been observed in past studies.

Title:The role of nutritional supplements in the prevention and treatment of resistance exercise-induced skeletal muscle injury.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Department of Health and Sport Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-3480, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu
Abstract:The topic of exercise-induced skeletal muscle injury has received considerable attention in recent years. Likewise, strategies to minimise the injury resulting from heavy resistance exercise have been studied. Over the past 15 years, several investigations have been performed focused on the role of nutritional supplements to attenuate signs and symptoms of muscle injury. Of these, some have reported favourable results, while many others have reported no benefit of the selected nutrient. Despite these mixed findings, recommendations for the use of nutritional supplements for the purposes of attenuating muscle injury are rampant within the popular fitness media and athletic world, largely without scientific support. Those nutrients include the antioxidant vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and vitamin E (tocopherol), N-acetyl-cysteine, flavonoids, L-carnitine, astaxanthin, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, creatine monohydrate, essential fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, bromelain, proteins and carbohydrates. A discussion of all published peer-reviewed articles in reference to these nutrients and their impact on resistance exercise-induced skeletal muscle injury is presented, in addition to a brief view into the potential mechanism of action for each nutrient.Based on the current state of knowledge, the following conclusions can be made with regard to nutritional supplements and their role in attenuating signs and symptoms of skeletal muscle injury occurring as a consequence of heavy resistance exercise: (i) there appears to be a potential role for certain supplements (vitamin C, vitamin E, flavonoids, and L-carnitine); (ii) these supplements cannot effectively eliminate muscle injury, only attenuate certain signs and symptoms; (iii) it is presently unclear what the optimal dosage of these nutrients is (whether used alone or in combination); (iv) it is unclear what the optimal pretreatment period is; and (v) the effectiveness is largely specific to non-resistance trained individuals.Ultimately, because so few studies have been conducted in this area, it is difficult to recommend with confidence the use of selected nutrients for the sole purpose of minimising signs and symptoms of resistance exercise-induced muscle injury, in particular with regard to resistance-trained individuals.

Title:Increased analytical precision in the hollow cathode discharge emission source by improved discharge current control.
Authors:['Tseng JL', 'Williams JC', 'Bartlow RB', 'Griffin ST', 'Williams JC Jr']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:A significant improvement in the precision of the hollow cathode as an emission source is reported. Precision of 1% or less has been observed several times over periods of several hours. An average long-term stability of 4.3% for Ll and 6.0% for Na in the emission signal from microsamples (less than 50 nL) deposited in the hollow cathode discharge source is reported. The improved precision is attributed primarily to the introduction of electronics that hold the discharge current more nearly constant and to the shielding of all wiring to the source from the power supply. A current-controlled switch that is capable of driving a hollow cathode discharge in either dc or pulsed mode is described. This switch is capable of generating current pulses as short as 2 microseconds through a resistive load and greatly improves the discharge stability and repeatability at turn-on in both the dc and pulsed modes. The characteristics of pulses produced by this switch are presented; however, analytical performance is reported only for the dc mode. Temporal current plots are presented for the new instrumentation and compared to plots taken with commonly used current-controlled power supplies. Instrumentation, operation, and sample preparation procedures are described. Typical temporal profiles of the emission signal from microsamples deposited in AI and stainless steel hollow cathodes are given.

Title:Vibratory regime classification of infant phonation.

Abstract:Infant phonation is highly variable in many respects, including the basic vibratory patterns by which the vocal tissues create acoustic signals. Previous studies have identified the regular occurrence of nonmodal phonation types in normal infant phonation. The glottis is like many oscillating systems that, because of nonlinear relationships among the elements, may vibrate in ways representing the deterministic patterns classified theoretically within the mathematical framework of nonlinear dynamics. The infant's preverbal vocal explorations present such a variety of phonations that it may be possible to find effectively all the classes of vibration predicted by nonlinear dynamic theory. The current report defines acoustic criteria for an important subset of such vibratory regimes, and demonstrates that analysts can be trained to reliably use these criteria for a classification that includes all instances of infant phonation in the recorded corpora. The method is thus internally comprehensive in the sense that all phonations are classified, but it is not exhaustive in the sense that all vocal qualities are thereby represented. Using the methods thus developed, this study also demonstrates that the distributions of these phonation types vary significantly across sessions of recording in the first year of life, suggesting developmental changes. The method of regime classification is thus capable of tracking changes that may be indicative of maturation of the mechanism, the learning of categories of phonatory control, and the possibly varying use of vocalizations across social contexts.

Title:Influence of strontia on various properties of surgical simplex P acrylic bone cement and experimental variants.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Xu J', 'Madigan S', 'Towler MR']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The fact that the composition of acrylic bone cement, as used in cemented primary arthroplasties, is not optimal has been highlighted in the literature. For example: (i) deleterious effects of the radiopacifier (BaSO(4) or ZrO(2) particles in the powder) have been reported; (ii) there is an indication that pre-polymerized poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) beads in the powder may be dispensed with; and (iii) there is a strong consensus that the accelerator commonly used, N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine (DMPT), is toxic and has many other undesirable properties. At the same time, the effectiveness of drugs that contain a strontium compound in treating the effects of osteoporosis has been explained in terms of the role of strontium in bone formation and resorption. This indicates that strontium compounds may also have desirable effects on osseointegration of arthroplasties. The present study is a detailed evaluation of 24 acrylic bone cement formulations comprising different relative amounts of BaSO(4), strontia (as an alternative radiopacifier), pre-polymerized PMMA beads and DMPT. A large number of properties of the curing and cured cement were determined, including setting time, polymerization rate, fracture toughness and fatigue life. The focus was on the radiopacifier, with the finding being that many properties of formulations that contained strontia were about the same or better than those for cements that contained BaSO(4). Thus, further developmental work on strontia-containing acrylic bone cements is justified, with a view to making them candidates for use in cemented primary arthroplasties.

Abstract:Weight concerns and weight control behaviors were evaluated among sixty 8-10 year-old African American girls and their parents/caregivers. Girls completed the McKnight Risk Factor Survey and parents completed a modified version regarding perceptions of their daughters' concerns and behaviors. Significant correlations between girls' and parents' were seen for Overconcern with Weight and Shape (r = .56) and Weight Control Behaviors (r = .33). Parents' correctly identified 72% of girls' responses for Overconcern with Weight and Shape, 60% for Binge, 85% for Purging and 58% for Weight Control Behaviors scales using clinical cutoffs. However, more stringent agreement coefficients indicated generally poor concordance between girls and parents. The modified McKnight may be useful for assessing awareness of these issues.

Title:MicroRNAs are aberrantly expressed in hypertrophic heart: do they play a role in cardiac hypertrophy?

Abstract:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered class of endogenous, small, noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Although miRNAs are highly expressed in the heart, their roles in heart diseases are currently unclear. Using microarray analysis designed to detect the majority of mammalian miRNAs identified thus far, we demonstrated that miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in hypertrophic mouse hearts. The time course of the aberrant miRNA expression was further identified in mouse hearts at 7, 14, and 21 days after aortic banding. Nineteen of the most significantly dysregulated miRNAs were further confirmed by Northern blot and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction, in which miR-21 was striking because of its more than fourfold increase when compared with the sham surgical group. Similar aberrant expression of the most up-regulated miRNA, miR-21, was also found in cultured neonatal hypertrophic cardiomyocytes stimulated by angiotensin II or phenylephrine. Modulating miR-21 expression via antisense-mediated depletion (knockdown) had a significant negative effect on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The results suggest that miRNAs are involved in cardiac hypertrophy formation. miRNAs might be a new therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases involving cardiac hypertrophy such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, valvular diseases, and endocrine disorders.

Abstract:The purpose of this study was to determine the acute effects of a spectrum of eccentric loads on force, velocity, and power during the concentric portion of maximal-effort jump squats utilizing a repeated measures design. Thirteen resistance-trained men (age = 22.8 +/- 2.9 years, weight = 87.1 +/- 11.8 kg, 163.5 +/- 28.6 kg squat 1 repetition maximum [1RM]; mean +/- SD), who routinely incorporated back squats into their training, participated as subjects in this investigation. Jump squat performance was assessed using 4 experimental conditions. The first of these conditions consisted of an isoinertial load equal to 30% of back squat 1RM. The remaining conditions consisted of jump squats with a concentric load of 30% 1RM, subsequent to the application of experimental augmented eccentric loading (AEL) conditions of 20, 50, and 80% of back squat 1RM, respectively. All subjects performed 2 sets of 1RM of maximum-effort jump squats with all experimental conditions in a counter-balanced sequence. Forty-eight hours after completing the first testing session, subjects repeated the experimental testing protocol to establish stability reliability. Peak performance values for the reliable variables of force, velocity, and power, as well as force and power values obtained at 20-ms intervals during the initial 400 ms of the concentric jump squat range of motion, showed no statistical difference (p > 0.05) across the experimental AEL loads. These results suggest that load-spectrum AEL prior to a 30% 1RM jump squat fails to acutely enhance force, velocity, and power.

Abstract:The purpose of this study was to compare the cortisol responses from a regular season game and a typical practice session in female National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I collegiate soccer players. Eighteen players were assigned to 2 groups, 10 starters and 8 nonstarters, depending on their playing time. Salivary cortisol concentration, as well as competitive sport anxiety (somatic and cognitive anxiety, self-confidence), was monitored before and after 1 regular season game and 1 typical practice session. Although salivary cortisol levels increased postgame for both starters (+250%) and nonstarters (+140%), they increased to a greater extent for the starters. Practice salivary cortisol did not significantly change (p > 0.05). Cognitive and somatic anxiety was greater pre- and postgame when compared with the pre- and postpractice scores, respectively. These data clearly demonstrate the psychological and physiological differences between soccer competition and practice in collegiate women. It appears that both physiological and psychological variables combine to contribute to the large stress hormone response to an actual competitive game.

Affiliation:AutoZone, Inc., Memphis, TN 38103, USA. zhou.ji@ieee.org
Abstract:This paper reviews the progress of negative selection algorithms, an anomaly/change detection approach in Artificial Immune Systems (AIS). Following its initial model, we try to identify the fundamental characteristics of this family of algorithms and summarize their diversities. There exist various elements in this method, including data representation, coverage estimate, affinity measure, and matching rules, which are discussed for different variations. The various negative selection algorithms are categorized by different criteria as well. The relationship and possible combinations with other AIS or other machine learning methods are discussed. Prospective development and applicability of negative selection algorithms and their influence on related areas are then speculated based on the discussion.

Title:Elution behavior of daptomycin-loaded calcium sulfate pellets: a preliminary study.
Authors:['Richelsoph KC', 'Webb ND', 'Haggard WO']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-3210, USA.
Abstract:Daptomycin is a new antibiotic active against many resistant Gram-positive organisms and seems an appropriate candidate for local delivery for severe musculoskeletal infections. Calcium sulfate dihydrate as a delivery vehicle is readily resorbable, allows new bone formation, and can be combined with therapeutic agents. We compared the elution of daptomycin and tobramycin in calcium sulfate pellets over time and determined the dissolution rates of the pellets. Unlike other water-soluble antibiotics, daptomycin required special techniques to convert the calcium sulfate from a hemihydrate powder to a hardened dihydrate shape. The elution of daptomycin on day 1 (537 microg/mL/g) was greater than that from days 2, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28. The concentration fell to 153 microg/mL/g and 37 microg/mL/g on days 2 and 3, respectively, then remained at between 5 microg/mL/g and 7 microg/mL/g for the remainder of the study. The elution behavior of the daptomycin pellets differed from that of the tobramycin-containing pellets on days 1 through 3, but was similar from day 7 through day 28. Daptomycin-containing pellets dissolved more rapidly in vitro than tobramycin-containing pellets, although the importance of this more rapid dissolution in an in vivo situation is unknown. Using the techniques described in this paper, daptomycin can be incorporated within a calcium sulfate matrix.

Title:Chronic nicotine self-administration augments hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to mild acute stress.
Authors:['Chen H', 'Fu Y', 'Sharp BM']
Affiliation:Department of Pharmacology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.
Abstract:We investigated the effect of chronic nicotine self-administration (SA) on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) hormonal responses to acute stressors. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given access to nicotine (0.03 mg/kg) for 23 h per day for 20 days. On day 1 of acquisition of nicotine SA, plasma levels of both adrenocorticotropin and corticosterone were significantly increased 15-30 min after the first dose of nicotine. These hormonal changes were no longer significant on day 3, when adrenocorticotropin levels were <60 pg/ml and corticosterone levels were <110 ng/ml during the hour after the first dose of nicotine. Chronic nicotine SA (20 days) significantly augmented (2-3-fold) both hormonal responses to mild foot shock stress (0.6 mA, 0.5 s per shock, 5 shocks per 5 min), but did not affect hormonal responses to moderate shock (1.2 mA, 0.5 s per shock, 5 shocks per 5 min), lipopolysaccharide or immobilization. Similar data were obtained in Lewis rats. These results provide further support for the concept that chronic nicotine SA is a stressor. In alignment with the effects of other stressors, nicotine activated the HPA axis on the first day of SA, but desensitization occurred with repeated exposure. Furthermore, chronic nicotine SA selectively cross-sensitized the HPA response to a novel stressor. These observations suggest that nicotine may selectively increase the HPA response to stressors in human smokers.

Title:Quantitative trait loci that determine mouse tibial nanoindentation properties in an F2 population derived from C57BL/6J x C3H/HeJ.

Abstract:Use of nanoindentation technology to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that regulate bone properties represents a novel approach to improving our understanding of molecular mechanisms that control bone matrix properties. Tibiae for QTL mapping were from an F2 population derived from C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ. A nanoindenter (Triboindenter; Hysitron, Minneapolis, MN) was used to conduct indentation tests on transverse sections. Genotyping was performed in The Jackson Laboratory. QTL mapping was conducted using software. We found that (1) tibiae from mice at 16 weeks of age were mature and suitable for measurement by a nanoindentor; (2) both stiffness modulus and hardness modulus in the F2 population appeared to have normal distributions, which suggested that multiple genetic factors control the bone properties; and (3) QTL for hardness were identified from five chromosomes (Chr 8, 12, 13, 17, and 19) and for stiffness, from four chromosomes (Chr 3, 8, 12, and 13). Among all detected QTL, one at the same location on Chr 12 was detected for both hardness and stiffness data. It explained the highest percentage of phenotypic variation in bone properties. Using nanoindentation technology to identify QTL that regulate bone properties yielded as many as six different chromosomal regions. Although the actual genes remain to be identified, nanoindentation will contribute to our understanding of molecular mechanisms and normal development processes that control the matrix properties of bone.

Abstract:PURPOSE: Despite the considerable mortality and morbidity associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), many developing countries lack reliable surveillance of these ailments and their risk factors to guide intervention. This study aims to provide the first population-based estimates of CVD morbidity and mortality among adults in Aleppo, Syria and the distribution of their risk factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of adults 18 to 65 years old residing in Aleppo, Syria was carried out in 2004, involving 2038 household representatives (45.2% men; mean age, 35.3 years; response rate, 86%). Main outcomes of interest were physician-diagnosed CVD (infarction, angina, failure, stroke) among survey participants, and past 5-year mortality due to CVD among their household members older than 20 years of age (N = 6252, 49.5% men). Measurement of blood pressure (BP), height and weight, and smoking history were obtained as well. RESULTS: Prevalence of CVD was 4.8% for heart disease and 1.0% for stroke. CVD was responsible for 45.0% of overall mortality reported in the past 5 years, whereby 49% of CVD deaths occurred before the age of 65 years. Mean age of death was 62.6 years (63.6 years for heart disease and 61.4 years for stroke). Annual crude death rate due to CVD was 314 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 215-414); of these, 179 were due to heart disease, and 135 due to stroke. More men than women died from heart disease, whereas the opposite was true for stroke. Hypertension was detected in 40.6% (47.7% men, 34.9%women), obesity in 38.2% (28.8% men, 46.4% women), and smoking (cigarettes or waterpipe) in 38.7% (63.6% men, 19.2% women) of participants. Of those surveyed, 39.3% had one CVD risk factor, 27.4% had two risk factors, and 8.3% had 3 risk factors. Main predictors of clustering of risk factors were older age, male gender, and low education. CONCLUSIONS: Syria is currently undergoing a stage in which morbidity and mortality from CVD are high but likely to increase based on the population's risk profile. CVD risk distribution in Syrian society highlights the non-generalizability of CVD models from developed societies, and calls for local studies to inform effective interventions and policies.

Title:Alternative acrylic bone cement formulations for cemented arthroplasties: present status, key issues, and future prospects.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, 316 Engineering Science Building, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:All the commercially available plain acrylic bone cement brands that are used in cemented arthroplasties are based on poly (methyl methacrylate) and, with a few exceptions, have the same constituents. It is well known that these brands are beset with many drawbacks, such as high maximum exotherm temperature, lack of bioactivity, and volumetric shrinkage upon curing. Furthermore, concerns have been raised about a number of the constituents, such as toxicity of the activator (N,N,dimethyl-p-toluidine) and possible involvement of the radiopacifier (BaSO(4) or ZrO(2) particles) in third-body wear. Thus, over the years, many research efforts have been expended to address these drawbacks, culminating in a large number of alternative formulations, which may be grouped into 16 categories. Although there are a number of reviews of the large literature that now exists on these formulations, each covers only some of the categories and none contains a detailed discussion of the germane issues. The objective of the present work, therefore, was to present a comprehensive and critical review of the whole field. In addition to succinct descriptions of the cements in each category, there are explicative summaries of literature reports, a detailed discussion of several key issues surrounding the potential for use of these cements in cemented arthroplasties, and a presentation of numerous ideas for future studies.

Abstract:Balance ability decreases with age, which results in an increased risk of falls for people over age 65. Tai Chi exercise appears to offer potential benefits in the reduction of falls for the elderly. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of extended (6- and 12-month) Tai Chi exercise interventions on balance and selected motor functions for senior citizens. Forty-seven subjects were recruited from two local senior centers. Twenty of them (M = 71.8 years, SD = 7.1), 11 in the Tai Chi exercise group and 9 in the control group, completed the pre-, mid- and post-tests over 12 months on five selected functional performance tests: static balance, dynamic balance, choice reaction time, heel-rise strength, and ankle flexibility. The Tai Chi group was provided with a one-hour Tai Chi exercise session per week for 12 months; the control group did not participate in any exercise program. Results showed that static balance improved significantly after a 6-month Tai Chi intervention. Moreover, the Tai Chi group maintained a higher level in the test performance compared with the control group at the end of the 12-month intervention, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. Data suggested that Tai Chi exercise intervention could produce a positive influence on balance control for the elderly over a prolonged period, but not on muscle strength and ankle flexibility.

Title:Dimerization and actin-bundling properties of villin and its role in the assembly of epithelial cell brush borders.
Authors:['George SP', 'Wang Y', 'Mathew S', 'Srinivasan K', 'Khurana S']
Affiliation:Department of Physiology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.
Abstract:Villin is a major actin-bundling protein in the brush border of epithelial cells. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that villin can bundle actin filaments using a single F-actin binding site, because it has the ability to self-associate. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we demonstrate villin self-association in living cells in microvilli and in growth factor-stimulated cells in membrane ruffles and lamellipodia. Using sucrose density gradient, size-exclusion chromatography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight, the majority of villin was identified as a monomer or dimer. Villin dimers were also identified in Caco-2 cells, which endogenously express villin and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells that ectopically express villin. Using truncation mutants of villin, site-directed mutagenesis, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer, an amino-terminal dimerization site was identified that regulated villin self-association in parallel conformation as well as actin bundling by villin. This detailed analysis describes for the first time microvillus assembly by villin, redefines the actin-bundling function of villin, and provides a molecular mechanism for actin bundling by villin, which could have wider implications for other actin cross-linking proteins that share a villin-like headpiece domain. Our study also provides a molecular basis to separate the morphologically distinct actin-severing and actin-bundling properties of villin.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To examine racial and ethnic disparities in new prescription drug use. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Secondary data analyses of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (1996-2001), a national survey representative of U.S. noninstitutionalized civilian population. Drug approval dates were from the GenRx database of Mosby. STUDY DESIGN: A negative binomial model was used to compare annual number of times when new drugs were obtained across racial and ethnic groups. Covariates in the model were demographic, economic characteristics, and health status. Drugs were considered new if approved within the past 5 years. We compared non-Hispanic whites with non-Hispanic blacks, and non-Hispanic whites with Hispanic whites, respectively, to examine racial and ethnic disparities separately. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Descriptive analyses found smaller racial disparities than ethnic disparities: the average annual number of times when new drugs were obtained was higher among non-Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic blacks (1.71 versus 1.36; p<.01) and Hispanic whites (1.71 versus 1.11; p<.01). Multivariate analyses found smaller ethnic than racial disparities: the number was 22-33 percent lower among non-Hispanic blacks than non-Hispanic whites (significant), and 5-16 percent lower among Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic whites (not always significant), respectively. While the absolute racial disparities decreased over the early years of the life cycles of the products, the reduction in disparities over time was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: There are racial disparities in the use of new medications, which persist during the first 5 years of marketing. Socioeconomic and health characteristics account for a larger share of ethnic disparities than racial disparities.

Title:Microphase separation induced by interfacial segregation of isotropic, spherical nanoparticles.
Authors:['Hore MJ', 'Laradji M']
Affiliation:Department of Physics, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:In a recent experiment by Chung et al. [Nano Lett. 5, 1878 (2005)] and simulation by Stratford et al. [Science 309, 2198 (2005)] on immiscible blends containing nanoscale particles, it was shown that the phase separation of the two polymers can be prevented as a result of the aggregation of the nanoparticles at the interfaces between the two polymers. Motivated by these studies, we performed large scale systematic simulations, based on the dissipative particle dynamics approach, on immiscible binary (A-B) fluids containing moderate volume fractions of isotropic nanoscale spherical particles N. The nanoparticles preferentially segregate at the interfaces between the two fluids if the pairwise interactions between the three components are such that chi(AB)>/chi(AN)-chi(BN)/. We find that at later times, the average domain size saturates to a value, L approximately R(N)/phi(N), where R(N) and phi(N) are the radius and volume fraction of the nanoparticles, respectively. For small nanoparticles, however, full phase separation is observed.

Title:Baseline and acute levels of corticosterone in Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens): effects of food supplementation, suburban habitat, and year.
Authors:['Schoech SJ', 'Bowman R', 'Bridge ES', 'Boughton RK']

Abstract:Recent work has shown that Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) living in suburban habitats, as well as birds that reside in a natural habitat (hereafter referred to as wildland birds) provided supplemental food during the pre-breeding period, have lower baseline corticosterone (CORT) levels than nonsupplemented wildland birds, suggesting that predictable and abundant foods can lower stress levels. Here, we investigate whether the acute CORT response to capture stress reflects our earlier findings. During the pre-breeding seasons in 2004 and 2005 we captured over 200 Florida Scrub-Jays and collected four blood samples from each bird over a 30 min time period. We compared hormonal and morphometric data from birds in four treatment groups: wildland birds that were provided with supplemental food during the pre-breeding period, wildland birds that were provided with supplemental food during the winter and pre-breeding period, nonsupplemented wildland birds, and suburban birds that effectively have access to ad libitum human-source food year-round. Suburban birds had lower baseline levels, and a more acute initial CORT response (i.e., rate of increase) than wildland birds, but we did not observe any differences among the treatment groups of wildland birds. Baseline CORT concentrations were unusually low across treatments in 2005, a year that was characterized by increased adult body mass, superior body condition, and a high fledgling success rate, all of which suggest favorable environmental conditions. Thus, abundant or more reliable food sources in 2005 may have overwhelmed any potential benefits of supplemental feeding and explain the absence of any strong experimental effects on CORT for that year.

Abstract:We report on a battery of behavioral screening tests that successfully identified several neurobehavioral mutants among a large-scale ENU-mutagenized mouse population. Large numbers of ENU-mutagenized mice were screened for abnormalities in central nervous system function based on abnormal performance in a series of behavior tasks. We developed and used a high-throughput screen of behavioral tasks to detect behavioral outliers. Twelve mutant pedigrees, representing a broad range of behavioral phenotypes, have been identified. Specifically, we have identified two open-field mutants (one displaying hyperlocomotion, the other hypolocomotion), four tail-suspension mutants (all displaying increased immobility), one nociception mutant (displaying abnormal responsiveness to thermal pain), two prepulse inhibition mutants (displaying poor inhibition of the startle response), one anxiety-related mutant (displaying decreased anxiety in the light/dark test), and one learning-and-memory mutant (displaying reduced response to the conditioned stimulus). These findings highlight the utility of a set of behavioral tasks used in a high-throughput screen to identify neurobehavioral mutants. Further analysis (i.e., behavioral and genetic mapping studies) of mutants is in progress with the ultimate goal of identification of novel genes and mouse models relevant to human disorders as well as the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

Abstract:A chemical reduction method was applied to deposit nano silver particles on a frosted microscope slide, precoated with indium tin oxide. The substrate was used to collect the surface-enhanced Raman spectrum of N1'-ethyl indirubin monooxime (EIM), a potential chemical for pharmaceutical application. From the observed surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectrum, EIM might interact with silver surface through the lone pair electrons of the oxime nitrogen atoms. Crystal violet (CV) and p-nitrobenzoic acid (PNBA) were also used to test the SERS probe capability of the substrate. The surface morphorlogy of the substrate has been characterized by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). The elementary composition was identified with Edex and X-ray element scanning.

Title:Energetic trade-offs between immunity and reproduction in male Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix).
Authors:['Boughton RK', 'Bridge ES', 'Schoech SJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. rboughton@archbold-station.org
Abstract:We investigated a postulated trade-off between reproduction and immune function by comparing the energetic costs of an immune response with phytohemagglutinin challenge (or injection) in castrated (low testosterone [T]) and intact (high T) Japanese Quail (Coturnix coturnix). Intact birds had higher resting metabolic rate (RMR) and significantly lower immune response than castrates. RMR of intact birds did not change in response to an immune challenge, suggesting that maintenance of reproductive tissues and associated high T is both immunosuppressive and energetically costly. Despite having a greater immune response than intact quail, castrates had a lower pre-challenge RMR than intact birds and paradoxically tended to decrease RMR during an immune challenge. This paradox may be because of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are released during immune responses. Cytokines promote energy conservation through malaise and soporific behaviors, possibly explaining the co-occurrence of a relatively strong immune response and a decrease in nocturnal RMR in castrates. The lower immune response in intact birds may not elicit as great a response of pro-inflammatory cytokines owing to an already elevated RMR from reproductive state, thus reducing any effect on RMR. The suppressed immune response and elevated RMR in intact birds may be because of T; however, we cannot separate the effects of T per se from the metabolic requirements of reproductive tissues.

Abstract:H9N2 influenza viruses have become established in terrestrial poultry in different Asian countries over the last 2 decades. Our previous study demonstrated that quail harbor increasingly diverse novel H9N2 reassortants, including both Chicken/Beijing/1/94 (Ck/Bei-like) and Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (G1-like) viruses. However, since 1999, the genesis and evolution of H9N2 viruses in different types of poultry have not been investigated systematically. In the present study, H9N2 viruses isolated from chickens, ducks, and other minor poultry species were characterized genetically and antigenically. Our findings demonstrate that Ck/Bei-like H9N2 viruses have been introduced into many different types of poultry in southern China, including quail, partridges, chukar, pheasant, guinea fowl, and domestic ducks, while G1-like viruses were commonly detected in quail, less frequently detected in other minor poultry species, and not detected in chickens and ducks. Genetic analysis revealed 35 genotypes of H9N2 viruses, including 14 novel genotypes that have not been recognized before. Our results also suggested that two-way interspecies transmission exists between different types of poultry. Our study demonstrates that the long-term cocirculation of multiple virus lineages (e.g., H5N1 and H9N2 viruses) in different types of poultry has facilitated the frequent reassortment events that are mostly responsible for the current great genetic diversity in H9N2 and H5N1 influenza viruses in this region. This situation favors the emergence of influenza viruses with pandemic potential.

Title:Meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, have the capacity to recall the "what", "where", and "when" of a single past event.

Abstract:Some non-human animals may possess the ability to recall the "what", "where", and "when" of a single past event. We tested the hypothesis that male meadow voles possess the capacity to recall the "what", "where", and "when" of a single past event associated with mate selection in two experiments. Briefly, male voles were allowed to explore an apparatus that contained two chambers. One chamber contained a day-20 pregnant female (24 h prepartum). The other chamber contained a sexually mature female that was neither pregnant nor lactating (REF female). Twenty-four hour after the exposure, the males were placed in the same apparatus, which was empty and clean. At this time, the pregnant female would have entered postpartum estrus (PPE), a period of heightened sexual receptivity. Males initially chose and spent significantly more time investigating the chamber that originally housed the pregnant female (now a PPE female) than the chamber that originally housed the REF female. Male voles also explored an apparatus containing a chamber with a PPE female and one chamber containing a REF female. Twenty-four hour later, males were placed into an empty and clean apparatus. The males did not display an initial choice and they spent similar amounts of time investigating the chamber that originally housed the PPE female (now a lactating female) and the chamber that originally housed the REF female. The results of these and additional experiments suggest that male voles may have the capacity to recall the "what", "where", and "when" of a single past event, which may allow males to remember the location of females who would currently be in heightened states of sexual receptivity.

Title:Melatonin acts at the suprachiasmatic nucleus to attenuate behavioral symptoms of infection.
Authors:['Freeman DA', 'Kampf-Lassin A', 'Galang J', 'Wen JC', 'Prendergast BJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:In common with reproduction, immune function exhibits strong seasonal patterns, which are driven by annual changes in day length (photoperiod) and melatonin secretion. Whereas changes in melatonin communicate seasonal time into the reproductive axis via subcortical receptors, the relevant melatonin targets for communicating seasonal time into the immune system remain unspecified. The authors report that melatonin implants targeting the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) induced a winter phenotype in the immune system. SCN melatonin implants attenuated infection-induced anorexia and cachexia, indicating that the SCN mediate the effects of melatonin on these behavioral and metabolic symptoms of infection. However, SCN melatonin implants failed to induce winter-like peripheral leukocyte concentrations or behavioral thermoregulatory responses to infection. In contrast, subcutaneous melatonin implants induced winter-like changes in all behavioral and immunological parameters. Melatonin acts directly at the SCN to induce seasonal changes in neural-immune systems that regulate behavior. The data identify anatomical overlap between neural substrates mediating the effects of melatonin on the reproductive and immune systems but also suggest that the SCN are not the sole mediator of photoperiodic effects of melatonin on immunity.

Title:Comparison of two questionnaires for patient-assessed hearing aid benefit.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Gilmore C', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:Two questionnaires, the Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (PHAB) and the intelligibility Rating Improvement Scale (IRIS), were developed to measure self-assessed hearing aid benefit. The response format differed in the two instruments: the PHAB required estimation of the proportion of time that certain situations presented communication problems, whereas the IRIS required estimation of the percentage of speech that could be understood in the same situations. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the potential of each questionnaire for clinical and research applications. They were compared in terms of the amount of self-assessed benefit they produced and their sensitivity to benefit differences in different listening situations. Both questionnaires were completed by 42 hearing aid wearers. Analyses of the results indicated that (1) the PHAB produced a significantly lower overall estimate of hearing aid benefit than the IRIS; (2) the PHAB was more sensitive than the IRIS to benefit differences in different listening situations; and (3) the pattern of self-assessed benefit determined with the PHAB was in agreement with previous investigations, whereas the pattern derived from the IRIS scores was not.

Abstract:We investigated the linguistic features of temporal cohesion that distinguish variations in temporal coherence. In an analysis of 150 texts, experts rated temporal coherence on three continuous scale measures designed to capture unique representations of time. Coh-Metrix, a computational tool that assesses textual cohesion, correctly predicted the human ratings with five features of temporal cohesion. The correlations between predicted and actual scores were all statistically significant. In a complementary study, we explored the importance of temporal cohesion in characterizing genre. A discriminant function analysis, using Coh-Metrix temporal indices, successfully distinguished the genres of science, history, and narrative texts. The results suggested that history texts are more similar to narrative texts than to science texts in terms of temporal cohesion.

Title:Ultrasound effect on osteoblast precursor cells in trabecular calcium phosphate scaffolds.
Authors:['Appleford MR', 'Oh S', 'Cole JA', 'Protivinsky J', 'Ong JL']
Affiliation:University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:This study investigated the in vitro effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on human embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells (HEPM, CRL-1486, ATCC, Manassas, VA), an osteoblast precursor cell line, during early adhesion to calcium phosphate scaffolds. Hydroxyapatite (HA) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) ceramic scaffolds were produced by a template coating method. Phospho-specific antibody cell-based ELISA (PACE) technique was utilized on stress activation proteins, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), P38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the anti-apoptosis mediator protein kinase B (PKB/AKT). Cell-based ELISAs were also performed on the membrane anchoring protein vinculin and alpha6beta4 integrin. LIPUS stimulated activation of PERK 1/2, PJNK, PP38 and vinculin in traditional two-dimensional (2-D) culture. Calcium release from the scaffolds was partially involved in the activation of PERK 1/2 when cell response was compared between culture on 2-D surfaces and three-dimensional (3-D) HA and TCP scaffolds. Effects of calcium extracted media from scaffolds alone could not account for the full activation of PJNK, PP38, PAKT, vinculin and alpha6beta4 integrin. LIPUS stimulation further increased PERK activity on TCP scaffolds corresponding with an increase in both vinculin and alpha6beta4 integrin levels. It was concluded from this study that LIPUS treatment can significantly affect stress signaling mediators and adhesion proteins in osteoblast precursor cells during the early cell-attachment phase to trabecular patterned scaffolds.

Title:On-line monitoring of microg/L levels of haloacetic acids using ion chromatography with post-column nicotinamide reaction and fluorescence detection.
Authors:['Simone PS Jr', 'Anderson GT', 'Emmert GL']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, United States.
Abstract:A method for measuring the concentrations of the five regulated haloacetic acids (HAA5) in drinking water is reported. This method uses ion chromatography to separate HAA5 species, followed by post-column reaction with nicotinamide and detection of the fluorescent products. The result of method detection limit, accuracy, precision, linearity and interference studies are reported. The on-line monitoring method is compared directly to USEPA 552.3 in Memphis drinking water. Though not meant to replace the USEPA 552.3 for compliance monitoring, the proposed method does offer attractive alternatives considering the ease of automation and application of on-line monitoring directly from drinking water distribution systems.

Abstract:Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is associated with secondary bacterial infections caused by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The pathogenesis of these complications is not completely understood; however, viral infection of respiratory epithelial cells promotes colonization by these bacteria. In the present study, RSV virions associated with NTHi and pneumococci in an inoculum-dependent manner in a fluid-phase binding assay. Adherence of NTHi and S. pneumoniae to epithelial cells transiently expressing RSV G glycoprotein was 2- and 2.2-fold higher, respectively, than adhesion to cells transfected with the vector alone (P <0.01). Furthermore, 4.6- and 6.2-fold larger numbers of NTHi and pneumococci bound to cells expressing a membrane-bound full-length RSV G protein than to cells expressing a truncated non-membrane-bound protein (P <or=0.005). Pre-incubating cells expressing membrane-bound G protein with blocking anti-RSV G antibodies reduced bacterial adherence by 78-84 % (P <or=0.005). These studies demonstrate that RSV G protein is a receptor for both NTHi and S. pneumoniae. Strategies to prevent this interaction may reduce the incidence of secondary bacterial complications of RSV infection.

Abstract:Previously, we have demonstrated that STAT-5B plays a role in thrombin-induced vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth and motility. To learn more about the role of STAT-5B in vessel wall remodeling, we examined its involvement in platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)-stimulated VSMC growth and motility and balloon injury-induced neointima formation. PDGF-BB activated STAT-5B as measured by its tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA binding, and reporter gene activity. PDGF-BB induced cyclin D1 expression, CDK4 activity, and Rb protein phosphorylation, leading to VSMC growth and motility, and these responses were suppressed by the blockade of STAT-5B. Increased cyclin D1 levels, CDK4 activity, and Rb protein phosphorylation were observed in 1-week balloon-injured arteries compared with uninjured arteries, and these responses were also suppressed by adenovirus-mediated expression of dnSTAT-5B. In addition, adenovirus-mediated expression of dnSTAT-5B attenuated balloon injury-induced smooth muscle cell migration from media to intima and their proliferation in intima, resulting in reduced neointima formation. These observations indicate that STAT-5B plays an important role in PDGF-BB-induced VSMC growth and motility in vitro and balloon injury-induced neointima formation in vivo.

Abstract:Hearing status in 75 adult subjects with sickle cell disease was examined. Thirty-one (or 41%) of the subjects failed the hearing screening. When examined by hemoglobin type, it was found that persons with sickle cell C disease had the greatest incidence of hearing loss, although all subject groups exhibited greater prevalence rates than the general population. The results suggest that routine audiologic assessment be incorporated into the regular medical examination for adults with sickle cell disease.

Abstract:The auditory system was assessed in 34 adult subjects with sickle cell disease using standard audiometric test techniques. The study results indicate that patients with sickle cell disease are at risk for retro-cochlear as well as cochlear dysfunction of the auditory system. However, there is no consistent audiometric pattern that is pathognomonic of sickle cell disease. The test results indicate that auditory status should be carefully monitored in all adult patients with sickle cell disease.

Title:A unified framework for finding differentially expressed genes from microarray experiments.
Authors:['Shaik JS', 'Yeasin M']
Affiliation:Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, CVPIA Lab, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN-38152, USA. jshaik@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: This paper presents a unified framework for finding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the microarray data. The proposed framework has three interrelated modules: (i) gene ranking, ii) significance analysis of genes and (iii) validation. The first module uses two gene selection algorithms, namely, a) two-way clustering and b) combined adaptive ranking to rank the genes. The second module converts the gene ranks into p-values using an R-test and fuses the two sets of p-values using the Fisher's omnibus criterion. The DEGs are selected using the FDR analysis. The third module performs three fold validations of the obtained DEGs. The robustness of the proposed unified framework in gene selection is first illustrated using false discovery rate analysis. In addition, the clustering-based validation of the DEGs is performed by employing an adaptive subspace-based clustering algorithm on the training and the test datasets. Finally, a projection-based visualization is performed to validate the DEGs obtained using the unified framework. RESULTS: The performance of the unified framework is compared with well-known ranking algorithms such as t-statistics, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), Adaptive Ranking, Combined Adaptive Ranking and Two-way Clustering. The performance curves obtained using 50 simulated microarray datasets each following two different distributions indicate the superiority of the unified framework over the other reported algorithms. Further analyses on 3 real cancer datasets and 3 Parkinson's datasets show the similar improvement in performance. First, a 3 fold validation process is provided for the two-sample cancer datasets. In addition, the analysis on 3 sets of Parkinson's data is performed to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method to multi-sample microarray datasets. CONCLUSION: This paper presents a unified framework for the robust selection of genes from the two-sample as well as multi-sample microarray experiments. Two different ranking methods used in module 1 bring diversity in the selection of genes. The conversion of ranks to p-values, the fusion of p-values and FDR analysis aid in the identification of significant genes which cannot be judged based on gene ranking alone. The 3 fold validation, namely, robustness in selection of genes using FDR analysis, clustering, and visualization demonstrate the relevance of the DEGs. Empirical analyses on 50 artificial datasets and 6 real microarray datasets illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. The analyses on 3 cancer datasets demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach on microarray datasets with two classes of samples. The scalability of the proposed unified approach to multi-sample (more than two sample classes) microarray datasets is addressed using three sets of Parkinson's Data. Empirical analyses show that the unified framework outperformed other gene selection methods in selecting differentially expressed genes from microarray data.

Abstract:The purpose of this study is to provide new perspectives on correlates of phonetic transcription agreement. Our research focuses on phonetic transcription and coding of infant vocalizations. The findings are presumed to be broadly applicable to other difficult cases of transcription, such as found in severe disorders of speech, which similarly result in low reliability for a variety of reasons. We evaluated the predictiveness of two factors not previously documented in the literature as influencing transcription agreement: canonicity and coder confidence. Transcribers coded samples of infant vocalizations, judging both canonicity and confidence. Correlation results showed that canonicity and confidence were strongly related to agreement levels, and regression results showed that canonicity and confidence both contributed significantly to explanation of variance. Specifically, the results suggest that canonicity plays a major role in transcription agreement when utterances involve supraglottal articulation, with coder confidence offering additional power in predicting transcription agreement.

Affiliation:The Univesity of Memphis, USA. amarguls@gmail.com
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To assess body size stigmatization attitudes (BSSA), their effect on friendship selection, and controllability beliefs in a sample of African American preschool-age children of low socioeconomic status. METHODS: Participants included 76 children attending Head Start. Children completed an adjective task, a friendship selection task, and a controllability task. RESULTS: On the adjective task, the Overweight figure received significantly more negative mean ratings than the Underweight figure; however, there were no significant differences between the mean ratings for the Overweight and Average figures or the Average and Underweight figures. On the friendship selection task, children preferred the Average or Underweight figures as playmates and friends. On the controllability task, greater control was associated with the Overweight figure than the Underweight figure. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that BSSA may be present in a sample of African American preschool-age children of low socioeconomic status. These attitudes may influence friendship selection and controllability beliefs.

Abstract:A major mechanism of azole resistance in Candida albicans is overexpression of the genes encoding the ATP binding cassette transporters Cdr1p and Cdr2p due to gain-of-function mutations in Tac1p, a transcription factor of the zinc cluster family. To identify the Tac1p regulon, we analyzed four matched sets of clinical isolates representing the development of CDR1- and CDR2-mediated azole resistance by using gene expression profiling. We identified 31 genes that were consistently up-regulated with CDR1 and CDR2, including TAC1 itself, and 12 consistently down-regulated genes. When a resistant strain deleted for TAC1 was examined similarly, expression of almost all of these genes returned to levels similar to those in the matched azole-susceptible isolate. Using genome-wide location (ChIP-chip) analysis (a procedure combining chromatin immunoprecipitation with hybridization to DNA intergenic microarrays), we found 37 genes whose promoters were bound by Tac1p in vivo, including CDR1 and CDR2. Sequence analysis identified nine new genes whose promoters contain the previously reported Tac1p drug-responsive element (CGGN(4)CGG), including TAC1. In total, there were eight genes whose expression was modulated in the four azole-resistant clinical isolates in a TAC1-dependent manner and whose promoters were bound by Tac1p, qualifying them as direct Tac1p targets: CDR1, CDR2, GPX1 (putative glutathione peroxidase), LCB4 (putative sphingosine kinase), RTA3 (putative phospholipid flippase), and orf19.1887 (putative lipase), as well as IFU5 and orf19.4898 of unknown function. Our results show that Tac1p binds under nonactivating conditions to the promoters of its targets, including to its own promoter. They also suggest roles for Tac1p in regulating lipid metabolism (mobilization and trafficking) and oxidative stress response in C. albicans.

Title:TDP1 facilitates chromosomal single-strand break repair in neurons and is neuroprotective in vivo.

Abstract:Defective Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) can cause spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1), a neurodegenerative syndrome associated with marked cerebellar atrophy and peripheral neuropathy. Although SCAN1 lymphoblastoid cells show pronounced defects in the repair of chromosomal single-strand breaks (SSBs), it is unknown if this DNA repair activity is important for neurons or for preventing neurodegeneration. Therefore, we generated Tdp1-/- mice to assess the role of Tdp1 in the nervous system. Using both in vitro and in vivo assays, we found that cerebellar neurons or primary astrocytes derived from Tdp1-/- mice display an inability to rapidly repair DNA SSBs associated with Top1-DNA complexes or oxidative damage. Moreover, loss of Tdp1 resulted in age-dependent and progressive cerebellar atrophy. Tdp1-/- mice treated with topotecan, a drug that increases levels of Top1-DNA complexes, also demonstrated significant loss of intestinal and hematopoietic progenitor cells. These data indicate that TDP1 is required for neural homeostasis, and reveal a widespread requisite for TDP1 function in response to acutely elevated levels of Top1-associated DNA strand breaks.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Both acute bouts of prior exercise (preconditioning) and antioxidant nutrients have been used in an attempt to attenuate muscle injury or oxidative stress in response to resistance exercise. However, most studies have focused on untrained participants rather than on athletes. The purpose of this work was to determine the independent and combined effects of antioxidant supplementation (vitamin C + mixed tocopherols/tocotrienols) and prior eccentric exercise in attenuating markers of skeletal muscle injury and oxidative stress in resistance trained men. METHODS: Thirty-six men were randomly assigned to: no prior exercise + placebo; no prior exercise + antioxidant; prior exercise + placebo; prior exercise + antioxidant. Markers of muscle/cell injury (muscle performance, muscle soreness, C-reactive protein, and creatine kinase activity), as well as oxidative stress (blood protein carbonyls and peroxides), were measured before and through 48 hours of exercise recovery. RESULTS: No group by time interactions were noted for any variable (P > 0.05). Time main effects were noted for creatine kinase activity, muscle soreness, maximal isometric force and peak velocity (P < 0.0001). Protein carbonyls and peroxides were relatively unaffected by exercise. CONCLUSION: There appears to be no independent or combined effect of a prior bout of eccentric exercise or antioxidant supplementation as used here on markers of muscle injury in resistance trained men. Moreover, eccentric exercise as used in the present study results in minimal blood oxidative stress in resistance trained men. Hence, antioxidant supplementation for the purpose of minimizing blood oxidative stress in relation to eccentric exercise appears unnecessary in this population.

Abstract:Both cigarette smoking and high fat meals induce oxidative stress, which is associated with the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. We compared blood antioxidant status, oxidative stress biomarkers and TAG in twenty smokers and twenty non-smokers, matched for age and physical activity, in response to a high fat test meal standardized to body mass. Blood samples were collected before feeding (resting and fasted) and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 h post feeding and analysed for antioxidant capacity (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity; TEAC), xanthine oxidase activity (XO), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA) and TAG. Smoking status (P < 0.001) and time (P < or = 0.01) effects were noted for all variables, with smokers demonstrating higher values compared with non-smokers for all variables except for TEAC, for which values were lower for smokers. XO, H2O2, MDA and TAG increased following feeding with a peak response at the 4 h post feeding time point, with the opposite response occurring for TEAC. Although no interaction effects were noted (P>0.05), contrasts revealed greater values in smokers compared with non-smokers for XO, H2O2, MDA and TAG, and lower values for TEAC at times from 1-6 h post feeding (P < or = 0.05). Our findings indicate that young cigarette smokers experience an exaggerated oxidative stress response to feeding, as well as hypertriacylglycerolaemia, as compared with non-smokers. These data provide insight into another possible mechanism associating cigarette smoking with ill health and disease.

Title:Interventions for waterpipe smoking cessation.
Authors:['Maziak W', 'Ward KD', 'Eissenberg T']
Affiliation:Syrian Center for Tobacco Studies, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. wmaziak@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Waterpipe smoking is a traditional method of tobacco use, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, but its use is now spreading throughout Europe and North America. It is smoked socially, often being shared between friends or family at home, or in dedicated bars and cafes that provide waterpipes to patrons. Because the smoke passes through a reservoir of water, waterpipe tobacco smoking is perceived as being less lethal than other methods of tobacco use. At least in some cultures, women and girls are more likely to use a waterpipe than to use other forms of tobacco, and it is popular among younger smokers. Accumulating evidence suggests that waterpipe smoking may be as addictive as other forms of tobacco use, and may carry similar or greater risks to health. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of tobacco cessation interventions for waterpipe users. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialized register, in June 2007. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, using variant terms and spellings ('waterpipe' or 'narghile' or 'arghile' or 'shisha' or 'goza' or 'narkeela' or 'hookah' or 'hubble bubble'). We searched for trials, published or unpublished, in any language, and especially in regions where waterpipe use is widespread. We have also used our own existing bibliography, compiled from conducting an earlier exhaustive review of the literature on waterpipe smoking. SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought randomized, quasi-randomized or cluster-randomized controlled trials of smoking cessation interventions for waterpipe smokers of any age or gender. The primary outcome of interest was abstinence from tobacco use, preferably sustained and biochemically verified, for at least six months from the start of the intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Each author intended to extract data and assess trial quality independently by standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies, but no eligible trials were identified. MAIN RESULTS: We found no completed intervention trials targeting waterpipe smokers. A pilot randomized controlled trial by the authors of this review is underway, and will be reported in future updates. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological and observational evidence suggests that waterpipe use is growing in popularity worldwide. It is widely and erroneously perceived to be less lethal than other forms of tobacco use. Women, girls, and young people are more likely to take up waterpipe smoking, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. More research is needed on its addictive properties, and on the associated health risks, both for users and exposed non-smokers. Evidence-based information about waterpipe's addictive and harmful properties should be developed and disseminated in order to deglamourise and denormalise its use. High quality randomized trials are needed to guide treatment of waterpipe smoking.

Abstract:Mannose-binding C-type lectin (MBL) was isolated from channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) NWAC 102 and 103 strains, blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) D+B and Rio Grande strains, hybrid catfish (channel catfish female NWAC 103 x blue catfish male D+B) sera, and purified by affinity chromatography from channel catfish Norris strain serum. Reduction of purified channel catfish MBL with 2-ME yielded a single band of 62 kDa by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using guinea pig anti-MBL IgG as primary antibody. Channel catfish NWAC 102 strain, channel catfish NWAC 103 strain and hybrid catfish sera had molecular masses of 63 kDa for MBL. Blue catfish (D+B strain) serum MBL had a molecular mass of 66 kDa. Rio Grande blue catfish serum MBL had a molecular mass of 65 kDa. Amino acid composition analysis (mol%) of the affinity-purified channel catfish MBL found a high content of serine present. Functional binding studies of channel catfish and blue catfish MBLs binding to Edwardsiella ictaluri were done using a dot-immunoblot ELISA method. A dot-immunoblot ELISA binding assay was done to compare nine different strains and species of channel catfish and blue catfish for their levels of serum MBL. Blue catfish had higher levels of MBL than did the various strains of channel catfish tested. MBL could be used as a genetic marker for selection of disease resistance in the different strains of catfish used in aquaculture. This study describes the presence of serum MBL in catfish and evidence for a C-type lectin complement pathway of innate immunity.

Title:Decreased blood antioxidant capacity and increased lipid peroxidation in young cigarette smokers compared to nonsmokers: Impact of dietary intake.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Department of Health and Sport Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Blood of cigarette smokers routinely displays decreased antioxidant capacity and increased oxidized lipids compared to nonsmokers. This is thought to be due to both chronic exposure to cigarette smoke in addition to low intake of dietary antioxidants, and is a routine finding in veteran smokers. No study to date has determined the independent and combined impact of dietary intake and cigarette smoking on blood antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress in a sample of young, novice smokers. METHODS: We compared resting plasma antioxidant reducing capacity (ARC; expressed in uric acid equivalents), serum trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), whole blood total glutathione, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), and plasma oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) between 15 young (24 +/- 4 years), novice smokers (pack-year history: 3 +/- 2) and 13 nonsmokers of similar age (24 +/- 5 years). Detailed dietary records were maintained during a seven-day period for analysis of total energy, macro- and micronutrient intake. RESULTS: ARC (0.0676 +/- 0.0352 vs. 0.1257 +/- 0.0542 mmolxL-1; mean +/- SD, p = 0.019), TEAC (0.721 +/- 0.120 vs. 0.765 +/- 0.130 mmolxL-1, p = 0.24) and glutathione (835 +/- 143 vs. 898 +/- 168 micromolxL-1, p = 0.28) were lower in smokers compared to nonsmokers, with only the former being statistically significant. MDA (0.919 +/- 0.32 vs. 0.647 +/- 0.16 mumolxL-1, p = 0.05) and oxLDL were both higher in smokers compared to nonsmokers (229 +/- 94 vs. 110 +/- 62 ngxmL-1, p = 0.12), although only the MDA comparison was of statistical significance. Interestingly, these findings existed despite no differences in dietary intake, including antioxidant micronutrient consumption, between both smokers and nonsmokers. CONCLUSION: These data, with specificity to young, novice cigarette smokers, underscore the importance of smoking abstinence. Future studies with larger sample sizes, inclusive of smokers of different ages and smoking histories, are needed to extend these findings.

Abstract:The available and proposed methods for determining the in vivo occlusal wear values of classes 1 and 2 restorations made of resinfilled composite materials are critically reviewed. A methodology to be used to address the fundamental question of the link between the wear of the in vivo restorations and the relevant mechanical properties of the materials is outlined. For the four commercial formulations of composite materials which are currently "fully acceptable" to the American Dental Association (Estilux Posterior, Ful-Fil, Occlusin, and P-10), analysis of the published clinical wear values versus time data is performed.

Abstract:Regulatory T (T(reg)) cells are a critical sub-population of CD4+ T cells that are essential for maintaining self tolerance and preventing autoimmunity, for limiting chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease, and for regulating homeostatic lymphocyte expansion. However, they also suppress natural immune responses to parasites and viruses as well as anti-tumour immunity induced by therapeutic vaccines. Although the manipulation of T(reg) function is an important goal of immunotherapy, the molecules that mediate their suppressive activity remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that Epstein-Barr-virus-induced gene 3 (Ebi3, which encodes IL-27beta) and interleukin-12 alpha (Il12a, which encodes IL-12alpha/p35) are highly expressed by mouse Foxp3+ (forkhead box P3) T(reg) cells but not by resting or activated effector CD4+ T (T(eff)) cells, and that an Ebi3-IL-12alpha heterodimer is constitutively secreted by T(reg) but not T(eff) cells. Both Ebi3 and Il12a messenger RNA are markedly upregulated in T(reg) cells co-cultured with T(eff) cells, thereby boosting Ebi3 and IL-12alpha production in trans. T(reg)-cell restriction of this cytokine occurs because Ebi3 is a downstream target of Foxp3, a transcription factor that is required for T(reg)-cell development and function. Ebi3-/- and Il12a-/- T(reg) cells have significantly reduced regulatory activity in vitro and fail to control homeostatic proliferation and to cure inflammatory bowel disease in vivo. Because these phenotypic characteristics are distinct from those of other IL-12 family members, this novel Ebi3-IL-12alpha heterodimeric cytokine has been designated interleukin-35 (IL-35). Ectopic expression of IL-35 confers regulatory activity on naive T cells, whereas recombinant IL-35 suppresses T-cell proliferation. Taken together, these data identify IL-35 as a novel inhibitory cytokine that may be specifically produced by T(reg) cells and is required for maximal suppressive activity.

Abstract:Autotaxin (ATX, NPP-2) catalyzes the conversion of lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a mitogenic cell survival factor that stimulates cell motility. The high expression of both ATX and receptors for LPA in numerous tumor cell types has produced substantial interest in exploring ATX as an anticancer chemotherapeutic target. ATX inhibitors reported to date are analogs of LPA, a phospholipid, and are more hydrophobic than is typical of orally bioavailable drugs. This study applied both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening techniques with hit rates of 20% and 37%, respectively, to identify a promising set of non-lipid, drug-like ATX inhibitors. Structure-based virtual screening necessitated development of a homology model of the ATX catalytic domain due to the lack of structural information on any mammalian NPP family member. This model provided insight into the interactions necessary for ATX inhibition, and produced a suitably diverse training set for the development and application of binary QSAR models for virtual screening. The most efficacious compound identified in this study was able to completely inhibit ATX-catalyzed hydrolysis of 1 microM FS-3 (a synthetic, fluorescent LPC analog) at a 10 microM concentration.

Title:Glycine propionyl-L-carnitine increases plasma nitrate/nitrite in resistance trained men.

Abstract:UNLABELLED: : We have recently demonstrated that oral intake of glycine propionyl-L-carnitine (GPLC) increases plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx), a surrogate measure of nitric oxide production. However, these findings were observed at rest, and in previously sedentary subjects. PURPOSE: In the present study, we sought to determine the impact of oral GPLC on plasma NOx at rest and in response to a period of reactive hyperemia in resistance trained men. METHODS: Using a double blind, crossover design, 15 healthy men (24 +/- 4 years) were assigned to GPLC (3 g/d PLC + 1044 mg glycine) and a placebo in random order, for a four-week period, with a two-week washout between condition assignment. Blood samples were taken from subjects at rest and at 0, 3, and 10 minutes following an ischemia-reperfusion protocol (six minutes of upper arm cuff occlusion at 200 mmHg followed by rapid reperfusion with cuff removal). Blood samples were taken from a forearm vein from the same arm used for the protocol and analyzed for total nitrate/nitrite. Data are presented as mean +/- SEM. RESULTS: A condition main effect (p = 0.0008) was noted for NOx, with higher values in subjects when using GPLC (45.6 +/- 2.8 mumol.L-1) compared to placebo (34.9 +/- 1.2 mumol.L-1). No time main effect was noted (p = 0.7099), although values increased approximately 12% from rest (37.7 +/- 2.7 mumol.L-1) to a peak at 10 minutes post protocol (42.3 +/- 3.3 mumol.L-1). The interaction effect was not significant (p = 0.8809), although paired time contrasts revealed higher values for GPLC compared to placebo at 3 (48.2 +/- 6.7 vs. 34.9 +/- 2.4 mumol.L-1; p = 0.033) and 10 (48.8 +/- 5.9 vs. 35.7 +/- 2.1 mumol.L-1; p = 0.036) minutes post protocol, with non-statistically significant differences noted at rest (41.8 +/- 4.5 vs. 33.6 +/- 2.5 mumol.L-1; p = 0.189) and at 0 minutes (43.6 +/- 5.1 vs. 35.4 +/- 2.7 mumol.L-1; p = 0.187) post protocol. An analysis by subject (collapsed across time) indicated that 11 of the 15 subjects experienced an increase in NOx with GPLC treatment. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that short-term oral GPLC supplementation can increase NOx in resistance trained men. However, as with many dietary supplements, there exist both "responders" and "non-responders" to treatment. Future work may focus on the mechanisms for the discrepancy in response to GPLC supplementation for purposes of NOx elevation.

Title:External Na+ is not required for Ca2+ mobilization in platelets stimulated with rattlesnake lectin or alpha-thrombin.

Abstract:The effects of extracellular sodium on platelet aggregation and calcium mobilization in platelets stimulated with either rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) lectin (RSL) or alpha-thrombin were compared. The absence of extracellular sodium had no effect on platelet aggregation or calcium mobilization in response to all levels of RSL tested. In contrast platelet aggregation was sodium-dependent in response to less than or equal to .2 units/ml alpha-thrombin. Surprisingly, calcium mobilization occurred in platelets treated with a threshold level of alpha-thrombin in the absence of external sodium. Thus sodium-dependent platelet aggregation in response to a low dose of thrombin apparently is not the result of sodium-dependent calcium mobilization.

Title:Autotaxin and lysophosphatidic acid stimulate intestinal cell motility by redistribution of the actin modifying protein villin to the developing lamellipodia.

Abstract:Autotaxin (ATX) is a potent tumor cell motogen that can produce lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from lysophosphatidylcholine. LPA is a lipid mediator that has also been shown to modulate tumor cell invasion. Autotaxin mRNA is expressed at significant levels in the intestine. Likewise, LPA2 receptor levels have been shown to be elevated in colon cancers. The molecular mechanism of ATX/LPA-induced increase in intestinal cell migration however, remains poorly understood. Villin is an intestinal and renal epithelial cell specific actin regulatory protein that modifies epithelial cell migration. In this study we demonstrate that both Caco-2 (endogenous villin) and MDCK (exogenous villin) cells, which express primarily LPA2 receptors, show enhanced cell migration in response to ATX/LPA. ATX and LPA treatment results in the rapid formation of lamellipodia and redistribution of villin to these cell surface structures, suggesting a role for villin in regulating this initial event of cell locomotion. The LPA-induced increase in cell migration required activation of c-src kinase and downstream tyrosine phosphorylation of villin by c-src kinase. LPA stimulated cell motility was determined to be insensitive to pertussis toxin, but was regulated by activation of PLC-gamma 1. Together, our results show that in epithelial cells ATX and LPA act as strong stimulators of cell migration by recruiting PLC-gamma 1 and villin, both of which participate in the initiation of protrusion.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Medically fragile teens who smoke need access to smoking cessation programs, because they are at even higher risk than their healthy peers for smoking-related complications. METHODS: To date, no studies on the outcome of smoking cessation programs for medically ill teens have been conducted. To suggest directions for future research, we turn to the literature on smoking cessation in the general population of teens and occasionally to the literature on adult smokers. RESULTS: Four areas are explored: (a) the prevalence of unaided cessation in healthy teens; (b) the outcomes of various treatments for smoking cessation in healthy adolescents; (c) special issues that should be considered when designing programs for medically ill teens; and (d) lessons learned from previous research. CONCLUSIONS: Medically ill teens face a number of medical, emotional, social, and developmental challenges that can affect the quitting process. Research is sorely needed to address the unique needs of this population.

Abstract:The estrogen dependence of breast cancer has long been recognized; however, the role of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) in cancer initiation was not known until we showed that it induces complete neoplastic transformation of the human breast epithelial cells MCF-10F. E(2) treatment of MCF-10F cells progressively induced high colony efficiency and loss of ductulogenesis in early transformed (trMCF) cells and invasiveness in Matrigel invasion chambers. The cells that crossed the chamber membrane were collected and identified as bsMCF; their subclones were designated bcMCF; and the cells harvested from carcinoma formation in severe combined immunodeficient mice were designated caMCF. These phenotypes correlated with gene dysregulation during the progression of the transformation. The highest number of dysregulated genes was observed in caMCF, being slightly lower in bcMCF, and lowest in trMCF. This order was consistent with the extent of chromosome aberrations (caMCF > bcMCF >>> trMCF). Chromosomal amplifications were found in 1p36.12-pter, 5q21.1-qter, and 13q21.31-qter. Losses of the complete chromosome 4 and 8p11.21-23.1 were found only in tumorigenic cells. In tumor-derived cell lines, additional losses were found in 3p12.1-14.1, 9p22.1-pter, and 18q11.21-qter. Functional profiling of dysregulated genes revealed progressive changes in the integrin signaling pathway, inhibition of apoptosis, acquisition of tumorigenic cell surface markers, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In tumorigenic cells, the levels of E-cadherin, epithelial membrane antigen, and various keratins were low and CD44E/CD24 were negative, whereas SNAI2, vimentin, S100A4, FN1, HRAS, transforming growth factor beta1, and CD44H were high. The phenotypic and genomic changes triggered by estrogen exposure that lead normal cells to tumorigenesis confirm the role of this steroid hormone in cancer initiation.

Title:Objective and subjective hearing aid assessment outcomes.
Authors:['Mendel LL']
Affiliation:School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, The University of Memphis, 807 Jefferson Avenue, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. lmendel@memphis.edu
Abstract:PURPOSE: To determine whether specific sentence recognition assessments were sensitive enough to serve as objective outcome measurements that document subjective improvements in speech understanding with hearing aids. METHOD: The Revised Speech Perception in Noise test (R-SPIN; R. C. Bilger, J. M. Nuetzel, W. M. Rabinowitz, & C. Rzeczkowski, 1984), the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT; M. Nilsson, S. D. Soli, & J. A. Sullivan, 1994), and the Quick Speech-in-Noise test (QuickSIN; Etymotic Research, 2001; M. C. Killion, P. A. Niquette, G. I. Gudmundsen, L. J. Revit, & S. Banerjee, 2004) were administered to 21 hearing aid users to determine whether the tests could adequately document improvements in speech understanding with hearing aids compared with the research participants' self-assessments of their own performance. Comparisons were made between unaided and aided performance on these sentence tests and on the Hearing Aid Performance Inventory (HAPI; B. E. Walden, M. Demorest, & E. Hepler, 1984). RESULTS: The R-SPIN, the HINT Quiet threshold, and the QuickSIN signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss were the most sensitive of the sentence recognition tests to objectively assess improvements in speech perception performance with hearing aids. Comparisons among the subjective and objective outcome measures documented that HAPI ratings improved as performance on the R-SPIN, the HINT Quiet threshold, and the QuickSIN SNR loss improved. CONCLUSIONS: Objective documentation of subjective impressions is essential for determining the efficacy of treatment outcomes in hearing aid fitting. The findings reported here more clearly define the relationship between objective and subjective outcome measures in an attempt to better define true hearing aid benefit.

Abstract:Waterpipe smoking, a traditional method of tobacco use, has experienced a resurgence in the Middle East and Indian subcontinent in recent years. Despite growing evidence of its dependence potential and health-damaging effects, waterpipe use has spread beyond these regions to many other countries, including the United States. Because little is known about waterpipe use in the United States, we surveyed convenience samples of users from two U.S. cities, Richmond, Virginia (n = 109), and Memphis, Tennessee (n = 34). Respondents in both cities were primarily young adults, a majority (75%) were men, and most were college students or had a college degree. Initial and current use usually occurred in a social context, with a group of friends in a cafe or restaurant or at home. Most respondents had smoked waterpipe for 2 or fewer years, and 67% currently smoked at least once a month (22% smoked at least once per week and 10% smoked daily). Most believed waterpipe use to be less addictive and harmful than cigarette smoking, believed they could quit use at any time, but had no plans or desire to quit. A majority of respondents used other tobacco products such as cigarettes, and 35% of those who did not smoke cigarettes said they would "probably" or "definitely" smoke one in the next year. Multivariate correlates of greater frequency of use included younger age at first use, ownership of a waterpipe, use occurring primarily with groups of friends, and the perception of being "hooked." Waterpipe users in these two convenience samples from the United States were young and educated, tended to experiment with multiple forms of tobacco, were unaware of the potentially harmful and addictive properties of waterpipe use, and planned to continue use in the future. Educational efforts are needed to increase awareness of the potential hazards of this increasingly popular form of tobacco use.

Title:Spectroscopic studies of triethoxysilane sol-gel and coating process.
Authors:['Li YS', 'Ba A']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Department of Chemistry, Memphis, TN 38152-3550, USA. yingli@memphis.edu
Abstract:Silica sol-gels have been prepared under different conditions using triethoxysilane (TES) as precursor. The prepared sol-gels have been used to coat aluminum for corrosion protection. Vibrational assignments have been made for most vibration bands of TES, TES sol-gel, TES sol-gel-coated aluminum and xerogel. It has been noticed that air moisture may have helped the hydrolysis of the thin coating films. Xerogels have been obtained from the sol-gel under different temperature conditions and the resulting samples have been characterized by using infrared and Raman spectroscopic methods. IR data indicate that the sol-gel process is incomplete under the ambient conditions although an aqueous condition can have slightly improved the process. Two nonequivalent silicon atoms have been identified from the collected 29Si NMR spectra for the sol-gel, supporting the result derived from the IR data. The frequency of Si-H bending vibration has been found to be more sensitive to the skeletal structure than that of the Si-H stretching vibration. A higher temperature condition could favor the progression of hydrolysis and condensation. A temperature higher than 300 degrees C would cause sample decomposition without seriously damaging the silica network. From infrared intensity measurements and thermo-gravimetric analyses, the fractions of incomplete hydrolysis and condensation species have been estimated to be 4% and 3%, respectively. Electrochemical data have shown that the sol-gel coating significantly improves the corrosion protection properties of aluminum.

Title:Relations of perceived motivational climate and feelings of belonging in physical education in urban schools.
Authors:['Wright PM', 'Li W', 'Ding S']
Affiliation:Department of Health & Sport Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. pwright2@memphis.edu
Abstract:The current pilot study examined the relationship between feelings of belonging and perceptions of motivational climate in physical education classes among 87 African-American, inner-city high school students (41 boys, 46 girls). Motivational climate was assessed by the Perceived Motivational Climate Questionnaire and feelings of belonging were assessed by the Belonging Scale. Contrary to the hypothesis, scores for both the task- and ego-involved subscales of the Perceived Motivational Climate Questionnaire had moderate positive correlations with scores on the Belonging Scale, indicating the relationship between these specific motivational climates and social-emotional outcomes in physical education is not clear and direct. Further research is warranted to assess these findings and to identify what experiences and instructional strategies are most effective in promoting social-emotional outcomes in physical education in urban schools.

Title:Relationship of jumping and agility performance in female volleyball athletes.

Affiliation:Department of Health and Sport Sciences, Exercise Neuromechanics Laboratory, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Court sports often require more frequent changes of direction (COD) than field sports. Most court sports require 180 degrees turns over a small distance, so COD in such sports might be best evaluated with an agility test involving short sprints and sharp turns. The purposes of this study were to (a) quantify vertical and horizontal force during a COD task, (b) identify possible predictors of court-sport-specific agility performance, and (c) examine performance difference between National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I, II, and III athletes. Twenty-nine collegiate female volleyball players completed a novel agility test, countermovement (CM) and drop jump tests, and an isometric leg extensor test. The number of athletes by division was as follows: I (n = 9), II (n = 11), and III (n = 9). The agility test consisted of 4 5-meter sprints with 3 180 degrees turns, including 1 on a multiaxial force platform so that the kinetic properties of the COD could be identified. One-way analysis of variance revealed that Division I athletes had significantly greater countermovement jump heights than Division III, and the effect size comparisons (Cohen's d) showed large-magnitude differences between Division I and both Divisions II and III for jump height. No other differences in performance variables were noted between divisions, although effect sizes reached moderate values for some comparisons. Regression analysis revealed that CM displacement was a significant predictor of agility performance, explaining approximately 34% of the variance. Vertical force was found to account for much of the total force exerted during the contact phase of the COD task, suggesting that performance in the vertical domain may limit the COD task used herein. This study indicates that individuals with greater CM performance also have quicker agility times and suggests that training predominantly in the vertical domain may also yield improvements in certain types of agility performance. This may hold true even if such agility performance requires a horizontal component.

Title:Photoperiod alters central distribution of estrogen receptor alpha in brain regions that regulate aggression.
Authors:['Kramer KM', 'Simmons JL', 'Freeman DA']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. kkramer1@earthlink.net
Abstract:Testosterone or its metabolite, estrogen, regulates aggression in males of many mammalian species. Because plasma testosterone levels are typically positively correlated with both aggression and reproduction, aggression is expected to be higher when males are in reproductive condition. However, in some photoperiodic species such as Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), males are significantly more aggressive in short day lengths when the testes are regressed and circulating testosterone concentrations are reduced. These results led to the formation of the hypothesis that aggression is modulated independently of circulating steroids in Siberian hamsters. Thus, recent studies have been designed to characterize the role of other neuroendocrine factors in modulating aggression. However, aggression may be mediated by testosterone or estrogen despite basal concentrations of these steroids by increasing sensitivity to steroids in specific brain regions. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that males housed under short days have increased expression of estrogen receptor alpha in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial amygdala, and central amygdala. Neural activation in response to an aggressive encounter was also examined across photoperiod.

Abstract:Childhood obesity is increasing worldwide, raising alarm about future trends of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. This article discusses what may underlie our failure to respond effectively to the obesity epidemic, and presents a wider perspective for future research and public health agendas. So far targeting individual-level determinants and clinical aspects of childhood obesity has produced limited success. There is growing interest in understanding the wider determinants of obesity such as the built environment (e.g. walkability), social interactions, food marketing and prices, but much needs to be learned. Particularly, we need to identify distal modifiable factors with multiple potential that would make them attractive for people and policymakers alike. For example, walking-biking-friendly cities can reduce obesity as well as energy consumption, air pollution and traffic delays. Such agenda needs to be driven by strong evidence from research involving multi-level influences on behaviour, as well as the study of wider politico-economic trends affecting people's choices. This article highlights available evidence and arguments for research and policy needed to curb the obesity epidemic. The upstream approach underlying these arguments aims to make healthy choices not only the most rational, but also the most feasible and affordable.

Title:Mechanical property, degradation rate, and bone cell growth of chitosan coated titanium influenced by degree of deacetylation of chitosan.
Authors:['Yuan Y', 'Chesnutt BM', 'Wright L', 'Haggard WO', 'Bumgardner JD']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Chitosan has shown promise as a coating for dental/craniofacial and orthopaedic implants. However, the effects of degree of deacetylation (DDA) of chitosan on coating bond strength, degradation, and biological performance is not known. The aim of this project was to evaluate bonding, degradation, and bone cell growth on titanium coated with chitosans of different DDA and from different manufacturers. Three different chitosans, 80.6%, 81.7%, and 92.3% DDA were covalently bonded to titanium coupons via silane-glutaraldehyde molecules. Bond strengths were evaluated in mechanical tensile tests, and degradation, over 5 weeks, was conducted in cell culture medium with and without 100 microg/mL lysozyme. Cytocompatibility was evaluated for 10 days using UMR 106 osteoblastic cells. Results showed that mean chitosan coating bond strengths ranged from 2.2-3.8 MPa, and that there was minimal affect of DDA on coating bond strengths. The coatings exhibited little dissolution over 5 weeks in medium with or without lysozyme. However, the molecular weight (MW) of the chitosan coatings remaining on the titanium samples after 5 weeks decreased by 69-85% with the higher DDA chitosan coatings exhibiting less percent change in MW than the lower DDA materials. The growth of the UMR 106 osteoblast cells on the 81.7% DDA chitosan coating was lower on days 3 and 5, as compared with the other two coatings, but by day 10, there were no differences in growth among three coatings or to the uncoated titanium controls. Differences in growth were attributed to differences in manufacturer source material, though all coatings were judged to be osteocompatible in vitro.

Title:Determination of the structure of lipid vesicle-bound angiotensin II and angiotensin I.
Authors:['Jalili PR', 'Dass C']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. cdass@memphis.edu
Abstract:A mass spectrometry (MS)-based strategy was developed to determine the structure of lipid vesicle-bound angiotensin II (AII) and angiotensin I (AI). It involves hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX), chemical modifications (e.g., nitration of tyrosine, acetylation of free amino group), and ladder sequencing. HDX is also combined with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to provide structural details at individual amino acid residues. It was observed that a major portion of both of these peptide hormones interacts with the phospholipid head groups on the surface of the vesicles and that Tyr residue is embedded in the vesicles. Both peptides have a U-shaped structure in the lipid environment.

Abstract:p27(Kip1) (p27), which controls eukaryotic cell division through interactions with cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), integrates and transduces promitogenic signals from various nonreceptor tyrosine kinases by orchestrating its own phosphorylation, ubiquitination and degradation. Intrinsic flexibility allows p27 to act as a "conduit" for sequential signaling mediated by tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation and ubiquitination. While the structural features of the Cdk/cyclin-binding domain of p27 are understood, how the C-terminal regulatory domain coordinates multistep signaling leading to p27 degradation is poorly understood. We show that the 100-residue p27 C-terminal domain is extended and flexible when p27 is bound to Cdk2/cyclin A. We propose that the intrinsic flexibility of p27 provides a molecular basis for the sequential signal transduction conduit that regulates p27 degradation and cell division. Other intrinsically unstructured proteins possessing multiple sites of posttranslational modification may participate in similar signaling conduits.

Abstract:CPT-11 is a potent antitumor agent that is activated by carboxylesterases (CE) and intracellular expression of CEs that can activate the drug results in increased cytotoxicity to the drug. As activation of CPT-11 (irinotecan-7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin) by human CEs is relatively inefficient, we have developed enzyme/prodrug therapy approaches based on the CE/CPT-11 combination using a rabbit liver CE (rCE). However, the in vivo application of this technology may be hampered by the development of an immune response to rCE. Therefore, we have developed a mutant human CE (hCE1m6), based on the human liver CE hCE1, that can activate CPT-11 approximately 70-fold more efficiently than the wild-type protein and can be expressed at high levels in mammalian cells. Indeed, adenoviral-mediated delivery of hCE1m6 with human tumor cells resulted in up to a 670-fold reduction in the IC(50) value for CPT-11, as compared to cells transduced with vector control virus. Furthermore, xenograft studies with human tumors expressing hCE1m6 confirm the ability of this enzyme to activate CPT-11 in vivo and induce antitumor activity. We propose that this enzyme should likely be less immunogenic than rCE and would be suitable for the in vivo application of CE/CPT-11 enzyme/prodrug therapy.

Abstract:Apoptosis is a key regulator for the normal turnover of the intestinal mucosa, and abnormalities associated with this function have been linked to inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Despite this, little is known about the mechanism(s) mediating intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis. Villin is an actin regulatory protein that is expressed in every cell of the intestinal epithelium as well as in exocrine glands associated with the gastrointestinal tract. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that villin is an epithelial cell-specific anti-apoptotic protein. Absence of villin predisposes mice to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis by promoting apoptosis. To better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the anti-apoptotic function of villin, we overexpressed villin in the Madin-Darby canine kidney Tet-Off epithelial cell line to demonstrate that expression of villin protects cells from apoptosis by maintaining mitochondrial integrity thus inhibiting the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Furthermore, we report that the anti-apoptotic response of villin depends on activation of the pro-survival proteins, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phosphorylated Akt. The results of our studies shed new light on the previously unrecognized function of villin in the regulation of apoptosis in the gastrointestinal epithelium.

Title:Implicit-solvent mesoscale model based on soft-core potentials for self-assembled lipid membranes.
Authors:['Revalee JD', 'Laradji M', 'Sunil Kumar PB']
Affiliation:Department of Physics, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:An efficient implicit-solvent model for self-assembled lipid bilayers is presented and analyzed using Langevin molecular dynamics simulations. The model is based on soft interactions between particles and short-range attractive interaction between lipid tails, leading for the self-assembly of a lipid bilayer without an explicit solvent. This allows for efficient simulations of large membranes over long times. The model exhibits a fluid phase at high temperatures and a gel phase at low temperatures, identified with the Lbeta-phase. The melting transition is investigated via analysis of the diffusivity of the lipid molecules, the chain-orientational order parameter, the sixfold bond-orientational order parameter, and the positional and bond-orientational correlation functions. The analysis suggests the existence of a hexatic phase over a narrow range of temperatures around the melting transition. The elastic properties of the membrane in the fluid phase are also investigated.

Title:Mathematical model of current-polarized ionophore-based ion-selective membranes.
Authors:['Zook JM', 'Buck RP', 'Langmaier J', 'Lindner E']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:A mathematical model is presented to describe the effects of constant current on ion-selective membranes using theta functions. The model provides exact analytic solutions for calculating the concentration polarization of the ionophore, the ion-ionophore complex, and the charged mobile sites in space and time within the membrane. It also predicts the time course of the membrane potential and the electric field inside the membrane following the application of constant current. This analytic solution is faster to compute than numerical simulations and provides the solution for any given time or position directly. The simulated concentration profiles compare favorably with concentration profiles recorded experimentally using spectro-electrochemical microscopy.

Abstract:This study employs sensitive methods to address the issue of exposure to secondhand smoke among children and women in an understudied developing country setting (Syria). The study combines data collected by the Syrian Center for Tobacco Studies as part of two international studies conducted in 2006: the Secondhand Smoke Exposure among Women and Children study (Johns Hopkins) and the Global Air Monitoring Study (Roswell Park Cancer Institute). We employed objective measures (hair nicotine, and ambient household nicotine assessed by passive monitors) to assess children's and mothers' exposure to secondhand smoke at home, and used the TSI SidePak personal aerosol monitor to sample respirable suspended particles less than 2.5 microm diameter (PM(2.5)) in the air in public places (40 restaurants/cafes in Aleppo). In homes, the mean ambient nicotine level (+/- standard deviation, SD) was 2.24 +/- 2.77 microg/m(3). Mean level of hair nicotine was 11.8 ng/mg among children (n = 54), and was higher if the mother was a smoker (19.4 +/- 23.6 ng/mg) than nonsmoker (5.2 +/- 6.9 ng/mg) (p < .05). Mean hair nicotine among nonsmoking mothers (n = 23) was 1.17 +/- 1.56 ng/mg. Children's hair nicotine level was strongly correlated with ambient household nicotine and number of cigarettes smoked daily in the house (r = .54 and r = .50, respectively, p < .001), and also was related to having a father who smoked in the children's presence. In public places, average PM(2.5) in the monitored 40 hospitality venues was 464 microg/m(3) and correlated with smoker density measured as cigarettes-waterpipes/100 m(3) (r = .31, p = 0.049). Thus, children in Syria are exposed to high levels of secondhand smoke at home, in which mothers' smoking plays a major role. Also, levels of respirable hazardous particles are high in public hospitality venues, putting customers and workers at serious health risks. Efforts to limit exposure of children and women at home and to adopt clean air policies should become a public health priority in Syria and the Arab region.

Title:Materials, fluid dynamics, and solid mechanics aspects of coronary artery stents: a state-of-the-art review.
Authors:['Lewis G']

Abstract:It is well known that, across all populations (based on geographic location, race, ethnicity, age, and sex), coronary artery disease (CAD) is the single most common cause of death. The commonly performed revascularization procedures for the treatment of symptomatic CAD are percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) by itself or followed by the deployment of either a bare-metal stent (BMS) or a drug-eluting stent (DES). In the latter type, a drug that is either embedded in polymeric or nonpolymeric coating(s) on the stent surface or directly attached to the stent surface elutes into the blood stream at a controlled rate over a period of time, typically 14-30 days. Over the years, there has been a steady decline in the use of PTCA and a concomitant sharp increase in the use of stents, with DESs being the predominant choice in the last 3 years. The present contribution represents a critical review of the literature on the materials, fluid dynamics, and solid mechanics aspects of both BMSs and DESs, with special reference to in-stent restenosis and in-stent thrombosis, these being risks that present commonly.

Title:Changes of gamma-tubulin expression and distribution in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) ovary, oocyte and embryo.
Authors:['Liu J', 'Lessman CA']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, The University of Memphis, 201 Life Science Building, Memphis, TN 38152-3560, USA.
Abstract:The tubulin gene family is important for individual zebrafish development from the oocyte through to hatching. This involves often rapid, complex changes in the gametes and embryonic cells that are reflected in underlying gene expression changes. Tubulin dynamics, i.e., the interchange of polymeric and soluble forms in zebrafish oogenesis and embryogenesis, is important for microtubule (MT) cellular functions. Nevertheless, our understanding of how tubulin gene expression changes during zebrafish development is not clear. Previous data showed that soluble alpha-tubulin and gamma-tubulin are associated with large molecular weight complexes (>2MDa) which are reduced by the blastula stage, with a concomitant decrease in soluble tubulin amount. Complexes (<2MDa) then increased in the gastrula with an increase in soluble tubulin. Microarray revealed similar patterns of tubulin gene product expression for zebrafish ovary and eggs while both differed from day 4 larva. In situ hybridization with gamma-tubulin oligonucleotide probes revealed diffuse label in oocytes, with a marked localization to the primordial blastodisc upon maturation. These findings, together with recent work on gamma-tubulin ring complexes in other species, suggest that gamma-tubulin (protein complexes) may be involved in regulating tubulin dynamics, thus is important for zebrafish oogenesis and embryogenesis.

Abstract:CYP1B1 and CYP19 (aromatase) have been shown to be expressed in breast tumors. Both enzymes are efficient estrogen hydroxylases, indicating the potential for overlapping substrate and inhibitor specificity. We measured the inhibition properties of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) against CYP1B1-catalyzed hydroxylation of 17beta-estradiol (E2) to determine whether CYP1B1 affects the disposition of AIs. In addition, we estimated the frequency of coexpression of these enzymes in breast tumor epithelium. Immunohistochemical analyses of CYP19 and CYP1B1 in a panel of 29 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast showed epithelial cell staining for CYP19 in 76% and for CYP1B1 in 97% of the samples. Statistical analysis showed no significant correlation (0.33) for positive expression of CYP19 and CYP1B1 (p > 0.07). CYP1B1 inhibition was determined for two steroidal inhibitors: formestane and exemestane and five nonsteroidal inhibitors: aminoglutethimide, fadrozole, anastrozole, letrozole, and vorozole. Of the seven compounds tested, only vorozole exhibited inhibition of CYP1B1 activity with IC(50) values of 17 and 21 microM for 4-hydroxy estradiol and 2-hydroxy estradiol, respectively. The estimated K(i) values of vorozole for E2 4- and 2-hydroxylation were 7.26 and 6.84 microM, respectively. Spectrophotometric studies showed that vorozole was a type II inhibitor of CYP1B1. This study shows that with the exception of vorozole, the aromatase inhibitors are selective for CYP19 relative to CYP1B1. Thus, although both CYP19 and CYP1B1 are expressed in a high percentage of breast cancers, CYP1B1 is not a major determinant of the disposition of AIs.

Abstract:Treatment for compound and/or comminuted fractures is frequently accomplished via external fixation. To achieve stability, the compositions of external fixators generally include aluminum alloy components due to their high strength-to-weight ratios. These alloys are particularly susceptible to corrosion in chloride environments. There have been several clinical cases of fixator failure in which corrosion was cited as a potential mechanism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of physiological environments on the corrosion susceptibility of aluminum 7075-T6, since it is used in orthopedic external fixation devices. Electrochemical corrosion curves and alternate immersion stress corrosion cracking tests indicated aluminum 7075-T6 is susceptible to corrosive attack when placed in physiological environments. Pit initiated stress corrosion cracking was the primary form of alloy corrosion, and subsequent fracture, in this study. Anodization of the alloy provided a protective layer, but also caused a decrease in passivity ranges. These data suggest that once the anodization layer is disrupted, accelerated corrosion processes occur.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Previous studies reported that some minority childhood cancer patients are likely to develop worse outcomes than white children. This study examines whether there are racial and ethnic disparities in health expenditures among children with cancer. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among children (younger than 20) with cancer diagnoses in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS; 1996 to 2004). Total health expenditures and the following subcategories were examined across racial and ethnic groups: (1) office-based visits; (2) outpatient visits; (3) inpatient and emergency room visits; (4) home health care; (5) prescription drugs; and (6) dental, vision, and other health care expenditures. Consumer price indexes were used to convert all expenditures to 2004 dollars. A classical linear model was analyzed using the natural logarithm of health expenditures as the dependent variable, with the purpose of determining whether there were racial and ethnic differences in health expenditures after adjusting for confounding factors. RESULTS: Study sample included 394 non-Hispanic whites (weighted to 4 958 685), 53 non-Hispanic blacks (weighted to 352 534), and 94 Hispanic whites (weighted to 424 319). Hispanic blacks and other minority populations were excluded from the analysis due to insufficient sample size. The annual total health expenditure for treating each child with cancer was $3467.40, $2156.15, and $5545.34, respectively, among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanic whites. The differences in the various subcategories of health expenditures across racial and ethnic groups were generally not significant according to both descriptive and analytical analyses with very few exceptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not identify significant racial and ethnic disparities in health care costs. However, one important study limitation is the small sample size of the minority populations in the study sample.

Title:Prospects of nanorods as an emulsifying agent of immiscible blends.
Authors:['Hore MJ', 'Laradji M']
Affiliation:Department of Physics, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Immiscible binary fluids containing rigid nanorods that are preferentially immersed in one of the two fluids are systematically investigated via dissipative particle dynamics simulations. For sufficiently high volume fraction and/or aspect ratio, nanorods lead to a pronounced slowing down of the phase separation process, and yield microphase-separated structures with a characteristic length scale that decreases as either the nanorods length or their volume fraction is increased. The slowing down of the dynamics is attributed to a disordered jamming of the nanorods in the preferred component and a dramatic reduction in their diffusion due to kinetic conformational hindrance. The final characteristic length scale of the dispersion, reduced by the nanorods length, is found to depend only on Onsager's dimensionless parameter psinu, where psi and nu are the nanorods volume fraction and aspect ratio, respectively. These results indicate that nanorods may be used as an effective emulsifying agent of binary polymer blends.

Abstract:Consumer choice is a key concept in developmental disability intervention, but relatively little quantitative research has focused on the relationship between choice and quality of life. This study used data from Washington state's Division of Developmental Disabilities 2002 National Core Indicators study (Human Services Research Institute, 2001a, 2001b) to examine the relationship between choice and 3 quality-of-life indicators: community inclusion, rights, and opportunities for relationships. Consumers (N = 224) with mild intellectual disabilities participated in the study. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the influence of type of living arrangement and choice on quality of life. Consumers who lived in the community and made more choices had higher scores on quality-of-life indicators. The findings have implications for disability policy, practice, and future research.

Abstract:The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of glycine propionyl-L-carnitine (GPLC) supplementation and endurance training for 8 wk on aerobic- and anaerobic-exercise performance in healthy men and women (age 18-44 yr). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: placebo (n=9), 1 g/d GPLC (n=11), or 3 g/d GPLC (n=12), in a double-blind fashion. Muscle carnitine (vastus lateralis), VO(2peak), exercise time to fatigue, anaerobic threshold, anaerobic power, and total work were measured at baseline and after an 8-wk aerobic-training program. There were no statistical differences (p> .05) between or within the 3 groups for any performance-related variable or muscle carnitine concentrations after 8 wk of supplementation and training. These results suggest that up to 3 g/d GPLC for 8 wk in conjunction with aerobic-exercise training is ineffective for increasing muscle carnitine content and has no significant effects on aerobic- or anaerobic-exercise performance.

Abstract:To meet the challenge of regenerating bone lost to disease or trauma, biodegradable scaffolds are being investigated as a way to regenerate bone without the need for an auto- or allograft. Here, we have developed a novel microsphere-based chitosan/nanocrystalline calcium phosphate (CaP) composite scaffold and investigated its potential compared to plain chitosan scaffolds to be used as a bone graft substitute. Composite and chitosan scaffolds were prepared by fusing microspheres of 500-900 microm in diameter, and porosity, degradation, compressive strength, and cell growth were examined. Both scaffolds had porosities of 33-35% and pore sizes between 100 and 800 . However, composite scaffolds were much rougher and, as a result, had 20 times more surface area/unit mass than chitosan scaffolds. The compressive modulus of hydrated composite scaffolds was significantly higher than chitosan scaffolds (9.29 +/- 0.8 MPa vs. 3.26 +/- 2.5 MPa), and composite scaffolds were tougher and more flexible than what has been reported for other chitosan-CaP composites or CaP scaffolds alone. Using X-ray diffraction, scaffolds were shown to contain partially crystalline hydroxyapatite with a crystallinity of 16.7% +/- 6.8% and crystallite size of 128 +/- 55 nm. Fibronection adsorption was increased on composite scaffolds, and cell attachment was higher on composite scaffolds after 30 min, although attachment rates were similar after 1 h. Osteoblast proliferation (based on dsDNA measurements) was significantly increased after 1 week of culture. These studies have demonstrated that composite scaffolds have mechanical properties and porosity sufficient to support ingrowth of new bone tissue, and cell attachment and proliferation data indicate composite scaffolds are promising for bone regeneration.

Abstract:The United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has emphasized the importance of utilizing health information technologies, thus making the availability of electronic resources critical for physicians across the country. However, few empirical assessments exist regarding the current status of computerization and utilization of electronic resources in physician offices and physicians' perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of computerization. Through a survey of physicians' utilization and perceptions of health information technology, this study found that a "digital divide" existed for eastern North Carolina physicians in smaller physician practices. The physicians in smaller practices were less likely to utilize or be interested in utilizing electronic health records, word processing applications, and the Internet.

Abstract:Waterpipe tobacco smoking is increasingly common worldwide, and evidence about its harmful effects to smokers is emerging. However, no studies have investigated the potential exposure of nonsmokers to waterpipe smoke. We measured particulate matter (PM) emissions (PM2.5, PM10) before and during laboratory sessions in which 20 individuals used a waterpipe to smoke tobacco and 20 individuals smoked a cigarette (10 for each particle-size/smoking-method), as well as 10 waterpipe and 10 cigarette smoldering sessions (i.e., without a smoker). A TSI-SidePak aerosol monitor obtained PM2.5, PM10 background, smoking, and maximum levels. Mean PM2.5 rose 447% for waterpipe (from 48 microg/m3 background to 264 microg/m3 smoking), and by 501% for cigarettes (from 44 microg/m3 to 267 microg/m3), whereas mean PM10 rose by 563% for waterpipe (from 55 microg/m3 to 365 microg/m3), and by 447% for cigarettes (from 52 microg/m3 to 287 microg/m3) (p<.05 for all). The increase in PM during cigarette smoking was due primarily to PM2.5, given that the proportion of PM2.5 from total PM10 increase was 95% compared with 70% for waterpipe (p<.05). Maximum PM2.5 was 908 microg/m3 for waterpipe and 575 microg/m3 for cigarettes, whereas maximum PM10 was 1052 microg/m3 for waterpipe and 653 microg/m3 for cigarettes. Mean PM2.5 and PM10 smoldering levels did not differ from background for waterpipe but were significantly higher for cigarettes (PM2.5: 33-190 microg/m3; PM10: 42-220 microg/m3). Policymakers considering clean air regulations should include waterpipe tobacco smoking, and the public should be warned about this source of smoke exposure.

Title:Nicotine self-administration differentially regulates hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor and arginine vasopressin mRNAs and facilitates stress-induced neuronal activation.

Abstract:Acute nicotine is a potent stimulus for activation of the stress-responsive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, while chronic nicotine self-administration (SA) desensitizes the ACTH response to self-administered nicotine but cross-sensitizes to mild footshock stress (mFSS). To identify underlying mechanisms, we investigated (1) the effects of chronic nicotine SA on the coexpression of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) mRNAs, the primary hypothalamic neuropeptides regulating ACTH release, in the parvocellular division of paraventricular nucleus (pcPVN), and (2) mFSS-induced activation of these neurons during nicotine SA. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were given 23 h/d unlimited access to self-administer nicotine (0.03 mg/kg per injection, i.v.) for 19 d. Brains were double labeled with fluorescence in situ hybridization of CRF and AVP mRNAs and triple labeled after mFSS exposure for CRF and AVP mRNAs and c-Fos protein. Chronic nicotine SA significantly increased AVP mRNA signal and the number of pcPVN AVP-positive (AVP(+)) neurons (twofold to threefold), reduced the number of CRF-positive (CRF(+)) neurons by approximately 60%, but increased pcPVN CRF(+)/AVP(+) neuronal number fivefold. Significantly, although chronic nicotine SA did not affect total c-Fos expression induced by mFSS in pcPVN CRF(+) neurons, the majority of the new CRF(+)/AVP(+) population was activated by this heterotypic stressor. These phenotypic neuronal alterations may provide the pivotal mechanism underlying the capacity of chronically self-administered nicotine to cross-sensitize the HPA response to specific stressors, suggesting that nicotine may augment HPA responsiveness to specific stressors in human smokers.

Abstract:Giant axonopathy (gaxp), an autosomal recessive mouse mutation, exhibits ataxia of the hind legs with a slight side-to-side wobble while walking. Within the genomic region of the gaxp locus, a total of 94 transcripts were identified; the annotation of these genes using OMIM and PubMed yielded three potential candidate genes. By cDNA microarray analysis, 54 genes located on or near the gaxp locus were found to exhibit differential expression between gaxp and littermate controls. Based on microarray data and the known function of genes identified, Slc12a6 was selected as the primary candidate gene and analyzed using the Reveal technology of SpectruMedix. A 17-base deletion was detected from within exon 4 of Slc12a6. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction validated the difference in Slc12a6 expression in different types of mice at the mRNA level, revealing a marked reduction in gaxp mice. Western blot analysis indicated that the protein product of Slc12a6, the K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter Kcc3, was not detectable in gaxp mice. The causative role of the exon 4 mutation within Slc12a6 in the gaxp phenotype was further confirmed by screening multiple inbred strains and by excluding the mutation of nearby genes within the gaxp locus.

Abstract:A series of aminophosphonates was synthesized, and their ability to carry alanine, a model hydrophilic molecule, across phospholipid bilayer membranes was evaluated. Aminophosphonates facilitate the membrane transport at moderate rates, which make them a suitable platform for the design of carriers for continuous drug release devices.

Abstract:Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) causes morbidity and mortality among preterm infants and is associated with nutrient malabsorption. Therefore, a preterm pig model that spontaneously develops NEC was used to investigate the relationship between severity of NEC lesions and galactose absorption in vivo and carrier-mediated glucose absorption by intact mid small intestine. Preterm pigs collected by caesarian section at 92% of gestation received parenteral nutrition with and without minimal enteral nutrition for 48 h before conversion to enteral nutrition with colostrum or an enteral formula. Pigs were killed when symptoms of NEC were observed or after 36-40 h of enteral nutrition. NEC lesions decreased in vivo absorption of galactose and mannitol by more than 50% and abolished carrier-mediated glucose uptake by tissues with lesions. Moreover, when NEC lesions were restricted to the colon, small intestinal tissues that seemed clinically healthy had decreased in vitro glucose absorption due to reduced uptake via the sodium-dependent glucose transporter with little or no involvement of the apical facilitative glucose carrier. The present findings reveal a direct relationship between the severity of NEC lesions and the magnitude of sugar malabsorption that is detectable before clinical symptoms are evident.

Title:Semantically linking and browsing PubMed abstracts with gene ontology.
Authors:['Vanteru BC', 'Shaik JS', 'Yeasin M']
Affiliation:Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. bcvanter@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: The technological advances in the past decade have lead to massive progress in the field of biotechnology. The documentation of the progress made exists in the form of research articles. The PubMed is the current most used repository for bio-literature. PubMed consists of about 17 million abstracts as of 2007 that require methods to efficiently retrieve and browse large volume of relevant information. The State-of-the-art technologies such as GOPubmed use simple keyword-based techniques for retrieving abstracts from the PubMed and linking them to the Gene Ontology (GO). This paper changes the paradigm by introducing semantics enabled technique to link the PubMed to the Gene Ontology, called, SEGOPubmed for ontology-based browsing. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) framework is used to semantically interface PubMed abstracts to the Gene Ontology. RESULTS: The Empirical analysis is performed to compare the performance of the SEGOPubmed with the GOPubmed. The analysis is initially performed using a few well-referenced query words. Further, statistical analysis is performed using GO curated dataset as ground truth. The analysis suggests that the SEGOPubmed performs better than the classic GOPubmed as it incorporates semantics. CONCLUSIONS: The LSA technique is applied on the PubMed abstracts obtained based on the user query and the semantic similarity between the query and the abstracts. The analyses using well-referenced keywords show that the proposed semantic-sensitive technique outperformed the string comparison based techniques in associating the relevant abstracts to the GO terms. The SEGOPubmed also extracted the abstracts in which the keywords do not appear in isolation (i.e. they appear in combination with other terms) that could not be retrieved by simple term matching techniques.

Abstract:The measurement of sodium ion concentration in urine can provide diagnostic information and guide therapy. Unfortunately, neutral-carrier-based ion-selective electrodes show a large positive drift and loss in selectivity in undiluted urine. The extraction of electrically neutral lipids from the urine into the sensing membrane was suggested as the main source of the drift, loss of selectivity and the consequent incorrect concentration readings. In this work, (i) solvent-solvent extraction, (ii) membrane-immobilized solvent extraction and (iii) solid phase extraction were used to remove interfering compounds from urine samples. The "cleaned" urine samples were subsequently analyzed using a calixarene (sodium ionophore X)-based, solid-contact, sodium-selective electrode in a flow-through manifold. The solid-contact sodium sensors had excellent stability in cleaned urine and an acceptable bias compared to commercial clinical analyzers.

Title:Locating suitable habitats for West Nile Virus-infected mosquitoes through association of environmental characteristics with infected mosquito locations: a case study in Shelby County, Tennessee.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Since its first detection in 2001, West Nile Virus (WNV) poses a significant health risk for residents of Shelby County in Tennessee. This situation forced public health officials to adopt efficient methods for monitoring disease spread and predicting future outbreaks. Analyses that use environmental variables to find suitable habitats for WNV-infected mosquitoes have the potential to support these efforts. Using the Mahalanobis Distance statistic, we identified areas of Shelby County that are ecologically most suitable for sustaining WNV, based on similarity of environmental characteristics to areas where WNV was found. The environmental characteristics in this study were based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data, such as elevation, slope, land use, vegetation density, temperature, and precipitation. RESULTS: Our analyses produced maps of likely habitats of WNV-infected mosquitoes for each week of August 2004, revealing the areas that are ecologically most suitable for sustaining WNV within the core of the Memphis urban area. By comparing neighbourhood social characteristics to the environmental factors that contribute to WNV infection, potential social drivers of WNV transmission were revealed in Shelby County. Results show that human population characteristics and housing conditions such as a high percentage of black population, low income, high rental occupation, old structures, and vacant housing are associated with the focal area of WNV identified for each week of the study period. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that use of the Mahalanobis Distance statistic as a similarity index to assess environmental characteristics is a potential raster-based approach to identify areas ecologically most suitable for sustaining the virus. This approach was also useful to monitor changes over time for likely locations of infected mosquito habitats. This technique is very helpful for authorities when making decisions related to an integrated mosquito management plan and targeted health education outreach.

Abstract:The use of nanoindentation to determine nanomechanical properties of mineralized tissues has been investigated extensively. A detailed, critical, and comprehensive review of this literature is the subject of the present work. After stating the motivation for the review, a succinct presentation of the challenges, advantages, and disadvantages of the various quasi-static nanoindentation test methods (to obtain elastic modulus, E, and hardness, H) and dynamic test methods (to obtain storage and loss moduli and/or loss/damping factor) is given in the form of a primer. Explicative summaries of literature reports on various intrinsic and extrinsic factors that significantly influence E and H, followed by 15 suggested topics for future research, are included additionally. This review is designed to present a compact guide to the principles of the nanoindentation technique and to emphasize considerations when determining material properties of mineralized tissues.

Title:Thermal stability of acrylic bone cement powder under shelf storage conditions: an isothermal microcalorimetric study.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Son Y']

Abstract:Heat-conduction isothermal microcalorimetry was used to measure the exothermic heat flow rate (Q) from the powder of a widely used commercially-available acrylic bone cement, Palacos R, when it interacted with ambient laboratory air, as a function of time, t, in the calorimeter, for up to 200 h. Four variants of the powder were used, these being unsterilized, sterilized using ethylene oxide gas, gamma-irradiated, in ambient air, with a minimum dosage of 2.5 Mrad, and gamma-irradiated, in ambient air, with a minimum dosage of 4.5 Mrad. In each case, the powder variant was tested after being stored on the shelf, under ambient conditions, for 2 days, 3 weeks and 9 months immediately following sterilization. Best-fit correlations between Q and t for each powder variant were determined. Then, this relationship was integrated over the period 14 h< or =t< or =200 h to give an estimate of the "effective" heat flow, Q(eff). For powder variants tested 2 days after being sterilized, the difference in their thermal stabilities (Qeff ranged from 0.19+/-0.01 to 0.62+/-0.03 microJ/g, respectively) was significant in the case of some pairs and not for others. However, for powders tested either 3 weeks or 9 months following sterilization, there was no significant difference between the means of Qeff (they ranged from 0.18+/-0.01 to 0.31+/-0.07 microJ/g) for any pair. These results suggest that an acrylic bone cement in which the powder is EtO-sterilized may be mixed with the liquid monomer for use in cemented arthroplasties after any length of time of shelf storage of the powder, under ambient conditions, whereas, for powders that are gamma-irradiated and then stored under the same conditions, at least 3 weeks should elapse before they are used in these procedures.

Abstract:The reduction of the aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) dialdehyde metabolite to its corresponding mono and dialcohols, catalyzed by aflatoxin B 1-aldehyde reductase (AFAR, rat AKR7A1, and human AKR7A3), is greatly increased in livers of rats treated with numerous chemoprotective agents. Recombinant human AKR7A3 has been shown to reduce the AFB 1-dialdehyde at rates greater than those of the rat AKR7A1. The activity of AKR7A1 or AKR7A3 may detoxify the AFB 1-dialdehyde, which reacts with proteins, and thereby inhibits AFB 1-induced toxicity; however, direct experimental evidence of this hypothesis was lacking. Two human B lymphoblastoid cell lines, designated pMF6/1A2/AKR7A1 and pMF6/1A2, were genetically engineered to stably express AKR7A1 and/or cytochrome P4501A2 (1A2). The pMF6/1A2/AKR7A1 cells were refractory to the cytotoxic effects of 3 ng/mL AFB 1, in comparison to pM6/1A2 cells, which were more sensitive. Diminished protection occurred at higher concentrations of AFB 1 in pMF6/1A2/AKR7A1 cells, suggesting that additional factors were influencing cell survival. COS-7 cells were transfected with either vector control, rat AKR7A1, or human AKR7A3, and the cells were treated with AFB 1-dialdehyde. There was a 6-fold increase in the dialdehyde LC 50, from 66 microM in vector-transfected cells to 400 microM in AKR7A1-transfected cells, and an 8.5-fold increase from 35 microM in vector-transfected cells to 300 microM in AKR7A3-transfected cells. In both cases, this protective effect of the AFAR enzyme was accompanied by a marked decrease in protein adducts. Fractionation of the cellular protein showed that the mitochondria/nuclei and microsomal fractions contained the highest concentration of protein adducts. The levels of human AKR7A3 and AKR7A2 were measured in 12 human liver samples. The expression of AKR7A3 was detectable in all livers and lower than those of AKR7A2 in 11 of the 12 samples. Overall, these results provide the first direct evidence of a role for rat AKR7A1 and human AKR7A3 in protection against AFB 1-induced cytotoxicity and protein adduct formation.

Abstract:Trifluoroethanol (TFE)-induced conformational changes in dynorphin A (1-13) were investigated using charge-state distribution (CSD) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX), combined with electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS). Individual amino acids involved in secondary structural elements were identified by collision-induced dissociation-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). It was observed that dynorphin A (1-13) largely exists in an unfolded conformation and a folded structure in increasing concentrations of TFE. In 50% TFE, it forms an alpha-helix that encompasses residues 1-9 and remains flexible from residues 10 to 13.

Abstract:Local antibiotic delivery is an emerging area of study designed to provide alternative methods of treatment to clinicians for compromised wound sites where avascular zones can prevent the delivery of antibiotics to the infected tissue. Antibiotic-loaded bone cement is the gold standard for drug-eluting local delivery devices but is not ideal because it requires a removal surgery. Chitosan is a biocompatible, biodegradable polymer that has been used in several different drug delivery applications. We evaluated chitosan as a potential localized drug delivery device. We specifically determined if chitosan could elute antibiotics in an active form that would be efficacious in inhibiting S. aureus growth. Elution of amikacin was 24.67 +/- 2.35 microg/mL (85.68%) after 1 hour with a final cumulative release of 27.31 +/- 2.86 microg/mL (96.23%) after 72 hours. Elution of daptomycin was 10.17 +/- 3.83 microg/mL after 1 hour (31.61% release) and 28.72 +/- 6.80 microg/mL after 72 hours (88.55%). The data from the elution study suggested effective release of amikacin and daptomycin. The activity studies indicated the eluants inhibited the growth of S. aureus. Incorporating antibiotics in chitosan could provide alternative methods of treating musculoskeletal infections.

Abstract:Family involvement in planning and choosing services has become a key intervention concept in developmental disability services. This study (N = 547) modeled patterns of family decision making and assessed benefits to persons with developmental disabilities (DDs) and their family members. A latent profile analysis identified 4 classes that were highly involved in decision making (n = 118), involved only in planning (n = 166), involved only in financial decisions (n = 75), and uninvolved (n = 188). Multiple regression analysis indicated that consumers with DD whose family members were highly involved received more services than consumers in other families. A multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that the family members in the highly involved and planning classes experienced more family member satisfaction than others. Findings have implications for practice.

Abstract:The emergence of resistant strains of Gram-positive organisms in osteomyelitis creates treatment challenges. Daptomycin is an antibiotic that shows promise for treating some resistant strains of Gram-positive infections; however, it has not been widely used clinically for the treatment of osteomyelitis. We determined whether daptomycin eluted from calcium sulfate-a local delivery vehicle used for the treatment of osteomyelitis-retained activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Daptomycin was mixed with calcium sulfate hemihydrate, with both laboratory powder and a commercial kit, to form a hardened pellet. Daptomycin was eluted from calcium sulfate and retained its ability to inhibit bacterial growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis for eluates gathered up to 28 days. Our preliminary data demonstrates sterilized pellets with daptomycin retained their ability to inhibit bacterial growth of certain strains of Gram-positive organisms.

Abstract:Cerebellar and frontal cortical pathologies have been commonly reported in schizophrenia, autism, and other developmental disorders. Whether there is a relationship between prefrontal and cerebellar pathologies is unknown. Using fixed potential amperometry, dopamine (DA) efflux evoked by cerebellar or, dentate nucleus electrical stimulation (50 Hz, 200 muA) was recorded in prefrontal cortex of urethane anesthetized lurcher (Lc/+) mice with 100% loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells and wildtype (+/+) control mice. Cerebellar stimulation with 25 and 100 pulses evoked prefrontal cortex DA efflux in +/+ mice that persisted for 12 and 25 s poststimulation, respectively. In contrast, 25 pulse cerebellar stimulation failed to evoke prefrontal cortex DA efflux in Lc/+ mice indicating a dependency on cerebellar Purkinje cell outputs. Dentate nucleus stimulation (25 pulses) evoked a comparable but briefer (baseline recovery within 7 s) increase in prefrontal cortex DA efflux compared to similar cerebellar stimulation in +/+ mice. However, in Lc/+ mice 25 pulse dentate nucleus evoked prefrontal cortex DA efflux was attenuated by 60% with baseline recovery within 4 s suggesting that dentate nucleus outputs to prefrontal cortex remain partially functional. DA reuptake blockade enhanced 100 pulse stimulation evoked prefrontal cortex responses, while serotonin or norepinephrine reuptake blockade were without effect indicating the specificity of the amperometric recordings to DA. Results provide neurochemical evidence that the cerebellum can modulate DA efflux in the prefrontal cortex. Together, these findings may explain why cerebellar and frontal cortical pathologies co-occur, and may provide a mechanism that accounts for the diversity of symptoms common to multiple developmental disorders.

Title:Evaluation of a synthetic vertebral body augmentation model for rapid and reliable cyclic compression life testing of materials for balloon kyphoplasty.

Abstract:Screening of augmentation materials for use in balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) may be carried out using vertebral bodies (VBs) prepared from fresh cadaveric or animal model spines, but this approach has many drawbacks. Alternatively, a validated synthetic VB augmentation model may be used. In the present work, such a model-a cube (26 mm sides) of low-density polyurethane foam with a centrally located through-thickness cylindrical hole (diameter = 4 mm) completely filled with a bolus of augmentation material-was used to compare two BKP augmentation materials with very different chemistries (a high-viscosity acrylic bone cement (PMMA) and a calcium phosphate bone substitute (CP)) in cyclic compression life tests. The test conditions were considered physiologically relevant: the model was immersed in phosphate buffered saline solution, at 37 degrees C; the frequency was 3 Hz; and the maximum load was either 1150 N or 2300 N (corresponding to a maximum stress of 1.7 or 3.4 MPa). At the high load, all four PMMA and two out of seven CP specimens ran out to 1 million cycles. CP specimens consistently ran out at the low load. The use of this model for rapid and reliable ex vivo screening of BKP augmentation materials was considered both valid (because of the clear demarcation seen in the qualitative and quantitative results obtained with the two materials tested) and appropriate (that is, clinically relevant to BKP).

Title:Chitosan-coated stainless steel screws for fixation in contaminated fractures.
Authors:['Greene AH', 'Bumgardner JD', 'Yang Y', 'Moseley J', 'Haggard WO']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:Stainless steel screws and other internal fixation devices are used routinely to stabilize bacteria-contaminated bone fractures from multiple injury mechanisms. In this preliminary study, we hypothesize that a chitosan coating either unloaded or loaded with an antibiotic, gentamicin, could lessen or prevent these devices from becoming an initial nidus for infection. The questions investigated for this hypothesis were: (1) how much of the sterilized coating remains on the screw with simulated functional use; (2) is the unloaded or loaded chitosan coating bacteriostatic and biocompatible; and (3) what amount and rate does an antibiotic elute from the coating? In this study, the gentamicin eluted from the coating at a detectable level during 72 to 96 hours. The coating was retained at the 90% level in simulated bone screw fixation and the unloaded and loaded chitosan coatings had encouraging in vitro biocompatibility with fibroblasts and stem cells and were bacteriostatic against at least one strain of Staphylococcus aureus. The use of an antibiotic-loaded chitosan coating on stainless steel bone screws and internal fixation devices in contaminated bone fracture fixation may be considered after optimization of antibiotic loading and elution and more expanded in vitro and in vivo investigations with other organisms and antibiotics.

Title:Effects of packaging environments on free radicals in gamma-irradiated UHMWPE resin powder blend with vitamin E.
Authors:['Ridley MD', 'Jahan MS']
Affiliation:Department of Physics, Biomaterials Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) powder (GUR 1020) was blended with high concentration (20%) of vitamin E (alpha-Tocopherol (alpha-T)) for direct detection of alpha-T radicals in presence of PE radicals. Samples were gamma-irradiated in sealed packages filled with N(2), or in open air. Free radicals were measured in open air environment for 71 days using electron spin resonance (ESR) technique. When irradiated in air, both alpha-T and alpha-T-resin produced identical ESR signals characteristics of tochopheroxyl radicals (alpha-T-O(*)), suggesting that PE radicals are quenched by alpha-T. There was no indication of growth of oxygen-induced radicals (OIR) either. However, when alpha-T-resin was irradiated in N(2), presence of both PE and alpha-T radicals were evident in the ESR spectra. And, OIR were produced by the same samples when they were subsequently exposed to air (for 71 days). Oxidation data recorded 85 days after postirradiation aging in air using Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, however, did not show any measurable difference between samples irradiated in N(2) and air.

Title:Neuroadaptive changes in the mesocortical glutamatergic system during chronic nicotine self-administration and after extinction in rats.
Authors:['Wang F', 'Chen H', 'Sharp BM']
Affiliation:Department of Pharmacology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennesse, USA.
Abstract:Nicotine self-administration causes adaptation in the mesocorticolimbic glutamatergic system, including the up-regulation of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits. We therefore determined the effects of nicotine self-administration and extinction on NMDA-induced glutamate neurotransmission between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). On day 19 of nicotine SA, both regions were microdialyzed for glutamate while mPFC was sequentially perfused with Kreb's Ringer buffer (KRB), 200 microM NMDA, KRB, 500 microM NMDA, KRB, and 100 mM KCl. Basal glutamate levels were unaffected, but nicotine self-administration significantly potentiated mPFC glutamate release to 200 microM NMDA, which was ineffective in controls. Furthermore, in VTA, nicotine self-administration significantly amplified glutamate responses to both mPFC infusions of NMDA. This hyper-responsive glutamate neurotransmission and enhanced glutamate subunit expression were reversed by extinction. Behavioral studies also showed that a microinjection of 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (NMDA-R antagonist) into mPFC did not affect nicotine or sucrose self-administration. However, in VTA, NBQX (AMPA-R antagonist) attenuated both nicotine and sucrose self-administration. Collectively, these studies indicate that mesocortical glutamate neurotransmission adapts to chronic nicotine self-administration and VTA AMPA-R may be involved in the maintenance of nicotine self-administration.

Abstract:The ubiquitously expressed Src tyrosine kinases (c-Src, c-Yes, and c-Fyn) regulate intestinal cell growth and differentiation. Src activity is also elevated in the majority of malignant and premalignant tumors of the colon. The development of fibroblasts with the three ubiquitously expressed kinases deleted (SYF cells) has identified the role of Src proteins in the regulation of actin dynamics associated with increased cell migration and invasion. Despite this, unexpectedly nothing is known about the role of the individual Src kinases on intestinal cell cytoskeleton and/or cell migration. We have previously reported that villin, an epithelial cell-specific actin-modifying protein that regulates actin reorganization, cell morphology, cell migration, cell invasion, and apoptosis, is tyrosine-phosphorylated. In this report using the SYF cells reconstituted individually with c-Src, c-Yes, c-Fyn, and wild type or phosphorylation site mutants of villin, we demonstrate for the first time the absolute requirement for c-Src in villin-induced regulation of cell migration. The other major finding of our study is that contrary to previous reports, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Jak3 (Janus kinase 3), does not regulate phosphorylation of villin or villin-induced cell migration and is, in fact, not expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. Further, we identify SHP-2 and PTP-PEST (protein-tyrosine phosphatase proline-, glutamate-, serine-, and threonine-rich sequence) as negative regulators of c-Src kinase and demonstrate a new function for these phosphatases in intestinal cell migration. Together, these data suggest that in colorectal carcinogenesis, elevation of c-Src or down-regulation of SHP-2 and/or PTP-PEST may promote cancer metastases and invasion by regulating villin-induced cell migration and cell invasion.

Abstract:Restoration of lung homeostasis following injury requires efficient wound healing by the epithelium. The mechanisms of lung epithelial wound healing include cell spreading and migration into the wounded area and later cell proliferation. We hypothesized that mechanical properties of cells vary near the wound edge, and this may provide cues to direct cell migration. To investigate this hypothesis, we measured variations in the stiffness of migrating human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE cells) approximately 2 h after applying a scratch wound. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) in contact mode to measure the cell stiffness in 1.5-microm square regions at different locations relative to the wound edge. In regions far from the wound edge (>2.75 mm), there was substantial variation in the elastic modulus in specific cellular regions, but the median values measured from multiple fields were consistently lower than 5 kPa. At the wound edge, cell stiffness was significantly lower within the first 5 microm but increased significantly between 10 and 15 microm before decreasing again below the median values away from the wound edge. When cells were infected with an adenovirus expressing a dominant negative form of RhoA, cell stiffness was significantly decreased compared with cells infected with a control adenovirus. In addition, expression of dominant negative RhoA abrogated the peak increase in stiffness near the wound edge. These results suggest that cells near the wound edge undergo localized changes in cellular stiffness that may provide signals for cell spreading and migration.

Abstract:Aging of the larynx is characterized by involutional changes which alter its biomechanical and neural properties and create a biological environment that is different from younger counterparts. Illustrative anatomical examples are presented. This natural, non-disease process appears to set conditions which may influence the effectiveness of botulinum toxin injection and our expectations for its success. Adductor spasmodic dysphonia, a type of laryngeal dystonia, is typically treated using botulinum toxin injections of the vocal folds in order to suppress adductory muscle spasms which are disruptive to production of speech and voice. A few studies have suggested diminished response to treatment in older patients with adductor spasmodic dysphonia. This retrospective study provides a reanalysis of existing pre-to-post treatment data as function of age. Perceptual judgments of speech produced by 42 patients with ADSD were made by two panels of professional listeners with expertise in voice or fluency of speech. Results demonstrate a markedly reduced positive response to botulinum toxin treatment in the older patients. Perceptual findings are further elucidated by means of acoustic spectrography. Literature on vocal aging is reviewed to provide a specific set of biological mechanisms that best account for the observed interaction of botulinum toxin treatment with advancing age.

Abstract:We examined the effects of tick SGx and saliva on basal- and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated cell migration and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling in fibroblasts. Repair of injured monolayers was delayed by SGx pretreatment and was not associated with reductions in cell number. In migration assays, SGx suppressed both basal- and PDGF-stimulated fibroblast movement. Furthermore, SGx and saliva reduced PDGF-stimulated ERK activity. Thus, the delayed repair of monolayer injuries resulted from SGx inhibiting fibroblast migratory responses to chemotactic signals. SGx also suppressed injury- and growth factor-induced ERK activation in renal epithelial OK cells. Our data suggest that maintenance of the tick feeding lesion results, in part, from suppressing ERK signaling and fibroblast migration, events playing integral roles in the wound healing response. The effects of SGx on cells not involved in wound healing suggest that a constituent(s) in tick saliva has global effects on the ERK signaling pathway.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: During hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, bloodborne Candida albicans interacts with vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which have the capacity to influence the local inflammatory response to this organism. METHODS: To elucidate the EC response to C. albicans, we determined the transcriptional profile of ECs infected with wild-type C. albicans strain SC5314 and a hypovirulent cph1Delta/cph1Delta efg1Delta/efg1Delta mutant, CAN34. These EC responses were also compared to our previously published data on the response of the macrophage-like THP-1 cell line to C. albicans. RESULTS: Infection with strain SC5314 induced upregulation of EC genes involved in chemotaxis, stress response, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis. Infection with CAN34 induced weaker expression of fewer genes. The angiogenic and anti-apoptotic response of ECs to C. albicans did not occur in THP-1 cells. However, there was upregulation of CCL3 and CCL4 expression in both cell types. Because CCR5 is the receptor for CCL3 and CCL4, we tested the susceptibility of CCR5(-/-) mice to disseminated candidiasis. The survival and renal fungal burden of the CCR5(-/-) mice were similar to that of wild-type control mice. CONCLUSIONS: ECs respond significantly differently to infection with C. albicans, compared with THP-1 cells. CCR5 is dispensable for the host defense against disseminated candidiasis in immunocompetent mice.

Abstract:This study determined the role of ventral tegmental area acetylcholine and glutamate receptors in modulating laterodorsal tegmentum stimulation-evoked dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens. Rapid changes in dopamine oxidation current were measured at carbon fiber microelectrodes using fixed potential amperometry in urethane anesthetized male mice. Intraventral tegmental area infusions of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist mecamylamine, or the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate significantly diminished dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens evoked by brief electrical stimulation of the laterodorsal tegmentum. These findings suggest that acetylcholine and ionotropic glutamate receptors influence rapid dopaminergic activity and thus the communication of behaviorally relevant information from ventral tegmental area dopamine cells to forebrain areas.

Abstract:Footshock response is used to study a variety of biological functions in mammals including drug self-administration, learning and memory and nociception. However, the genetics underlying variability in footshock sensitivity are not well understood. In the current studies, a panel of B6.A consomic mouse strains, two B6.D2 genome-tagged mouse lines, and the progenitor strains were screened for footshock sensitivity as measured by audible vocalization. It was found that A/J (A) mice and C57BL/6J (B6) mice with an A Chromosome 1 (Chr 1) were less sensitive to footshock compared to B6 animals. Furthermore, the offspring of Chr 1 consomic mice crossed with B6 mice had vocalization levels that were intermediate to A/J and B6 animals. A F2 mapping panel revealed two significant QTLs for footshock vocalization centered around D1Mit490 and D1Mit206 on Chr 1. The role of these Chr 1 loci in footshock sensitivity was confirmed in B6.D2 genome-tagged mouse lines.

Abstract:DYT1 dystonia is caused by a single GAG deletion in exon 5 of TOR1A, the gene encoding torsinA, a putative chaperone protein. In this study, central and peripheral nervous system perturbations (transient forebrain ischemia and sciatic nerve transection, respectively) were used to examine the systems biology of torsinA in rats. After forebrain ischemia, quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction identified increased torsinA transcript levels in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum at 24 h and 7 days. Expression declined toward sham values by 14 days in striatum, thalamus and cortex, and by 21 days in cerebellum and hippocampus. TorsinA transcripts were localized to dentate granule cells and pyramidal neurons in control hippocampus and were moderately elevated in these cell populations at 24 h after ischemia, after which CA1 expression was reduced, consistent with the loss of this vulnerable neuronal population. Increased in situ hybridization signal in CA1 stratum radiatum, stratum lacunosum-moleculare, and stratum oriens at 7 days after ischemia was correlated with the detection of torsinA immunoreactivity in interneurons and reactive astrocytes at 7 and 14 days. Sciatic nerve transection increased torsinA transcript levels between 24 h and 7 days in both ipsilateral and contralateral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). However, increased torsinA immunoreactivity was localized to both ganglion cells and satellite cells in ipsilateral DRG but was restricted to satellite cells contralaterally. These results suggest that torsinA participates in the response of neural tissue to central and peripheral insults and its sustained up-regulation indicates that torsinA may contribute to remodeling of neuronal circuitry. The striking induction of torsinA in astrocytes and satellite cells points to the potential involvement of glial elements in the pathobiology of DYT1 dystonia.

Abstract:Separations of flexible polymers using on-chip hydrodynamic chromatography (HDC) have been studied with dissipative particle dynamic simulations, a novel computational technique that fully accounts for hydrodynamic interactions among polymer segments and with walls. The current study focuses on comparisons of simulation results on elution times with that predicted by earlier theoretical models for HDC separation. The elution times obtained in simulation are found to compare reasonably well with the theoretical prediction when chain stretching is not significant. Deviation from the theoretical prediction occurs when the chain stretching becomes significant. We observe a reversal in elution order and the reversal occurs at a Deborah number about 8, slightly larger than the Deborah number at the onset of chain stretching. The simulations also confirm the applicability of the Aris-Taylor equation for the convective dispersion of small solutes and for solutes like polymer chains, except the latter requires the use of a modified Peclet number.

Abstract:Cellular simultaneous recurrent neural network (SRN) has been shown to be a function approximator more powerful than the multilayer perceptron (MLP). This means that the complexity of MLP would be prohibitively large for some problems while SRN could realize the desired mapping with acceptable computational constraints. The speed of training of complex recurrent networks is crucial to their successful application. This work improves the previous results by training the network with extended Kalman filter (EKF). We implemented a generic cellular SRN (CSRN) and applied it for solving two challenging problems: 2-D maze navigation and a subset of the connectedness problem. The speed of convergence has been improved by several orders of magnitude in comparison with the earlier results in the case of maze navigation, and superior generalization has been demonstrated in the case of connectedness. The implications of this improvements are discussed.

Abstract:Choline cytidylyltransferase (CCT) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the phosphatidylcholine biosynthetic pathway. Here, we demonstrate that CCT alpha-mediated phosphatidylcholine synthesis is required to maintain normal Golgi structure and function as well as cytokine secretion from the Golgi complex. CCT alpha is localized to the trans-Golgi region and its expression is increased in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated wild-type macrophages. Although LPS triggers transient reorganization of Golgi morphology in wild-type macrophages, similar structural alterations persist in CCT alpha-deficient cells. Pro-tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 remain lodged in the secretory compartment of CCT alpha-deficient macrophages after LPS stimulation. However, the lysosomal-mediated secretion pathways for interleukin-1 beta secretion and constitutive apolipoprotein E secretion are unaltered. Exogenous lysophosphatidylcholine restores LPS-stimulated secretion from CCT alpha-deficient cells, and elevated diacylglycerol levels alone do not impede secretion of pro-tumor necrosis factor alpha or interleukin-6. These results identify CCT alpha as a key component in membrane biogenesis during LPS-stimulated cytokine secretion from the Golgi complex.

Title:Acute mild footshock alters ethanol drinking and plasma corticosterone levels in C57BL/6J male mice, but not DBA/2J or A/J male mice.

Abstract:Stress is an often-reported cause for alcohol consumption in humans. Acute intermittent footshock is a frequently used paradigm to produce stress in laboratory animals including mice. The effect produced by intermittent footshock stress on ethanol self-administration has been inconsistent: both increases and decreases in ethanol consumption have been reported. The current set of studies further investigates, in three commonly studied mouse strains, the effect of footshock stress on ethanol self-administration. Furthermore, the effect of footshock on plasma corticosterone levels was determined to investigate potential biochemical correlates. Adult male C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and A/J mice were allowed to self-administer 10% (wt/vol) ethanol for 12 days in a standard 23-h two-bottle paradigm before receiving either 15 min of mild inescapable footshock or no footshock. Shock intensity was equal to the mean intensity at which each strain vocalized as previously determined. Following footshock, animals had the opportunity to self-administer ethanol for an additional 23 h. Separate animals were subjected to either footshock or no shock prior to collection of plasma for corticosterone. Mild footshock stress altered ethanol self-administration and increased plasma corticosterone levels in C57BL/6J mice. Footshock stress did not alter ethanol self-administration or plasma corticosterone levels in DBA/2J or A/J mice. These data demonstrate that mild footshock stress is a suboptimal method of modeling the stress-induced increases in ethanol consumption often reported by humans.

Title:The early- and late stages in phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells: differential roles for lysophosphatidic acid.

Abstract:Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has been implicated as causative in phenotypic modulation (PM) of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in their transition to the dedifferentiated phenotype. We evaluated the contribution of the three major LPA receptors, LPA1 and LPA2 GPCR and PPARgamma, on PM of VSMC. Expression of differentiated VSMC-specific marker genes, including smooth muscle alpha-actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, calponin, SM-22alpha, and h-caldesmon, was measured by quantitative real-time PCR in VSMC cultures and aortic rings kept in serum-free chemically defined medium or serum- or LPA-containing medium using wild-type C57BL/6, LPA1, LPA2, and LPA1&2 receptor knockout mice. Within hours after cells were deprived of physiological cues, the expression of VSMC marker genes, regardless of genotype, rapidly decreased. This early PM was neither prevented by IGF-I, inhibitors of p38, ERK1/2, or PPARgamma nor significantly accelerated by LPA or serum. To elucidate the mechanism of PM in vivo, carotid artery ligation with/without replacement of blood with Krebs solution was used to evaluate contributions of blood flow and pressure. Early PM in the common carotid was induced by depressurization regardless of the presence/absence of blood, but eliminating blood flow while maintaining blood pressure or after sham surgery elicited no early PM. The present results indicate that LPA, serum, dissociation of VSMC, IGF-I, p38, ERK1/2, LPA1, and LPA2 are not causative factors of early PM of VSMC. Tensile stress generated by blood pressure may be the fundamental signal maintaining the fully differentiated phenotype of VSMC.

Title:Latitude affects degree of advancement in laying by birds in response to food supplementation: a meta-analysis.
Authors:['Schoech SJ', 'Hahn TP']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. sschoech@memphis.edu
Abstract:Food supplementation experiments have provided considerable information about the importance of resource availability in timing reproduction. Supplemented birds usually advance breeding over non-supplemented controls. Initial observations suggested that degree of advancement in studies conducted at higher latitudes was less than in those at lower latitudes. We hypothesized that birds at high latitudes are less responsive to the "supplementary" cue of food. We tested this hypothesis using a literature-based meta-analysis of 36 papers which, because several papers presented separate data sets from different years, yielded 56 "studies." We used step-wise regression to determine whether latitude, elevation, the duration of supplementation, and the migratory status of the species predicted the degree to which mean clutch initiation dates of food supplemented birds differed from non-supplemented controls (i.e., effect size = X(ent -- X(suppl)). Consistent with our predictions, there was a significant inverse relationship between effect size and latitude: elevation, migratory status, and duration of treatment contributed little to the model. Because the response of animals' reproductive systems to environmental information is mediated by the neuroendocrine system, we discuss two models: (1) the adaptive specialization hypothesis in which higher latitude species that experience a relatively short breeding season have evolved a reliance on photic cues while exhibiting reduced sensitivity to non-photic cues; and (2) the conditional plasticity hypothesis in which an individual might show a marked response to non-photic information if it lived at low latitudes, but be largely driven by photic cues, endogenous rhythms, or both to the relative exclusion of non-photic information if it lived at higher latitudes.

Title:Group cognitive behavioural therapy for depression outcomes predicted by willingness to engage in homework, compliance with homework, and cognitive restructuring skill acquisition.

Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. neimeyer@memphis.edu
Abstract:There is a need to understand the mechanism through which homework contributes to clinically meaningful change in therapy. Theoretically meaningful factors such as willingness to complete therapeutic assignments and cognitive skill acquisition have not been carefully studied in prior research. Depressed outpatients (N = 46) received cognitive behavioural group therapy for a 10-week period and were assigned relevant homework activities. Patient self-report and independent ratings of homework compliance were obtained on a session-by-session basis. Using path analysis, the authors found evidence that willingness to complete homework assignments and mastery of skill in cognitive restructuring helped account for the relationship between homework compliance and reduced symptom severity (R2 = .40). However, paths were only significant when patient self-report of homework compliance was used in the model. The present study highlights the problems in assessing homework compliance and in assuming that independent assessment of compliance is more accurate than patient self-report.

Abstract:UNLABELLED: Oxidative stress seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). Exercise training can increase endogenous antioxidant protection and decrease the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of exercise training on oxidative status in persons with PD. METHODS: Sixteen subjects with PD were match-randomly assigned to resistance exercise (n = 8) or a no-exercise control group (n = 8) on the basis of disease stage (Hoehn and Yahr stages I and II) and sex. Supervised exercise was performed twice weekly for 8 wk, consisting of three sets each of the leg press, leg curl, and calf press. Resting blood samples were taken from subjects before and after the intervention and assayed for markers of oxidative stress [malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)] and antioxidant capacity (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity). RESULTS: The exercise program was well-tolerated and associated with modest trends toward decreased oxidative stress and increased antioxidant capacity. The two biomarkers of oxidative stress were decreased after exercise training [MDA (15%) and H2O2 (16%)]. With these changes, a postintervention difference was apparent between the resistance exercise training and control groups for H2O2 (P = 0.007), with a trend for difference noted for MDA (P = 0.06). The mean increases in superoxide dismutase (9%) and glutathione peroxidase (15%) noted in the exercise training group were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Short-term resistance training may be associated with reduced oxidative stress in subjects with PD. Future studies with larger samples, inclusive of a higher volume of resistance exercise, are needed to extend these findings.

Authors:['Berry RB', 'Werner DF', 'Wang X', 'Jablonski MM', 'Homanics GE', 'Mittleman G', 'Matthews DB']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Recent research has begun to demonstrate that specific subunits of GABA(A) receptors may be involved in the normal expression of specific behaviors. The present research used mice with GABA(A) receptors whose alpha1 subunits contained mutations of serine 270 to histidine and leucine 277 to alanine in the TM2 region. The purpose was an attempt to examine the possible role that this particular subunit may have in learning the spatial and nonspatial version of the Morris water maze task. Mutant animals, compared to controls, displayed elevated levels of pool circling in both the spatial task and the nonspatial task. These results suggested that normal performance of the spatial and nonspatial water maze tasks may be dependent upon a natural alpha1 subunit array.

Title:Regulation of cell division by intrinsically unstructured proteins: intrinsic flexibility, modularity, and signaling conduits.
Authors:['Galea CA', 'Wang Y', 'Sivakolundu SG', 'Kriwacki RW']
Affiliation:Department of Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 North Lauderdale Street, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.
Abstract:It is now widely recognized that intrinsically unstructured (or disordered) proteins (IUPs or IDPs) are found in organisms from all kingdoms of life. In eukaryotes, IUPs are highly abundant and perform a wide range of biological functions, including regulation and signaling. Despite an increased level of interest in understanding the structural biology of IUPs and IDPs, questions regarding the mechanisms through which disordered proteins perform their biological function(s) remain. In other words, what are the relationships between disorder and function for IUPs? There are several excellent reviews that discuss the structural properties of IUPs and IDPs since 2005 [Receveur-Brechot, V., et al. (2006) Proteins 62, 24-45; Mittag, T., and Forman-Kay, J. D. (2007) Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 17, 3-14; Dyson, H. J., and Wright, P. E. (2005) Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 6, 197-208]. Here, we briefly review general concepts pertaining to IUPs and then discuss our structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies of two IUPs, p21 and p27, which regulate the mammalian cell division cycle by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Some segments of these two proteins are partially folded in isolation, and they fold further upon binding their biological targets. Interestingly, some portions of p27 remain flexible after binding to and inhibiting the Cdk2-cyclin A complex. This residual flexibility allows otherwise buried tyrosine residues within p27 to be phosphorylated by non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs). Tyrosine phosphorylation relieves kinase inhibition, triggering Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the flexible C-terminus of p27. This, in turn, marks p27 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, unleashing full Cdk2 activity which drives cell cycle progression. p27, thus, constitutes a conduit for transmission of proliferative signals via post-translational modifications. The term "conduit" is used here to connote a means of transmission of molecular signals which, in the case of p27, correspond to tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and, ultimately, proteolytic degradation. Transmission of these multiple signals is enabled by the inherent flexibility of p27 which persists even after tight binding to the Cdk2-cyclin A complex. Importantly, activation of the p27 signaling conduit by oncogenic NRTKs contributes to tumorigenesis in some human cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) [Grimmler, M., et al. (2007) Cell 128, 269-280] and breast cancer [Chu, I., et al. (2007) Cell 128, 281-294]. Other IUPs may participate in conceptually similar molecular signaling conduits, and dysregulation of these putative conduits may contribute to other human diseases. Detailed study of these IUPs, both alone and within functional complexes, is required to test these hypotheses and to more fully understand the relationships between protein disorder and biological function.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To examine interdisciplinary collaboration via electronic medical records (EMRs) with a focus on physicians' perception of nursing documentation. DESIGN: Quality improvement project using a survey instrument. LOCATION: Tertiary care pediatric hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven physicians. OUTCOME MEASURE: Physicians perceptions of nursing documentation after EMR implementation KEY FINDINGS: Physicians desire nursing documentation with greater clarity and additional information. Physicians indicate checklists alone for patient assessment and intervention data are insufficient for effective nurse/physician collaboration. Narrative nursing summaries are invaluable references that guide medical treatment decisions. Physicians see detailed assessments and well-described interventions of nurses' as critical to their ability to effectively practice medicine. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Health care technology is called to develop EMRs that enable nurses to document detailed patient data in a swift and straightforward manner. Joint collaboration between nurses, physicians, and technology specialists is recommended to develop effective EMR systems.

Abstract:Auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) recorded with simultaneous presentation of multiple tones modulated from 77-105 Hz exhibit frequency specificity and can be acquired with monotic or dichotic stimulation. This study examined the frequency specificity and dichotic characteristics of 40 Hz ASSRs recorded with amplitude-modulated (AM) probe tones and unmodulated (UM) or AM interfering tones in 27 normal-hearing adults. The effects on ASSR amplitudes of monotically or dichotically presented interfering tones of various frequency, modulation depth, and modulation rate were studied. Significant decreases in ASSR amplitudes occurred when the UM interfering tone was monotic, higher in frequency, and approximately within an octave of the probe tone. ASSR amplitudes were also reduced when the AM interfering tone was monotic and modulated at a lower depth and was an octave above the probe tone. Probe and interfering AM tones modulated at different rates produced similar reductions in amplitude for ASSRs acquired with monotic and dichotic stimulation. The findings of this study contribute to clarifying the carrier and temporal envelope interactions between tonal stimuli. Description of the effects of these stimulus parameters on 40 Hz ASSRs can benefit clinical applications of this technique, including evaluating auditory function in adults not capable of participating in behavioral audiometric tests.

Abstract:Clinical professionals working in end-of-life (EOL) contexts are frequently relied upon to address questions of meaning with dying and bereaved persons. Similar to the gulf between researchers and practitioners besetting the larger healthcare community, the voices of EOL practitioners are often underrepresented in the empirical literature. This study aimed to further the dialogue in the field of thanatology by surveying and describing the therapeutic approaches that EOL practitioners most commonly report using to facilitate meaning-making. A total of 119 practitioners from a range of EOL disciplines were surveyed to write about their intervention strategies for helping clients/patients make sense of loss. Overall, participants discussed using 23 different therapeutic approaches that comprised three overarching categories: 1) presence of the helping professional; 2) elements of the process; and 3) therapeutic procedures. Importantly, the results also indicated that practitioners from the different EOL occupations are converging on many of the same strategies for promoting meaning-making. Implications for future research on evaluating the effectiveness of meaning-making interventions are also discussed.

Title:African Americans in bereavement: grief as a function of ethnicity.
Authors:['Laurie A', 'Neimeyer RA']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Few empirical studies have explored the grieving process among different ethnic groups within the United States, and very little is known about how African Americans and Caucasians may differ in their experience of loss. The purpose of this study was to examine the African-American experience of grief, with particular emphasis on issues of identity change, interpersonal dimensions of the loss, and continuing attachments with the deceased. Participants were 1,581 bereaved college students (940 Caucasians and 641 African Americans) attending classes at a large southern university. Each participant completed the Inventory of Complicated Grief-Revised, the Continuing Bonds Scale, and questions regarding the circumstances surrounding his or her loss. Results revealed that African Americans experienced more frequent bereavement by homicide, maintenance of a stronger continuing bond with the deceased, greater grief for the loss of extended kin beyond the immediate family, and a sense of support in their grief, despite their tendency to talk less with others about the loss or seek professional support for it. Overall, African Americans reported higher levels of complicated grief symptoms than Caucasians, especially when they spent less time speaking to others about their loss experience. Implications of these findings for bereavement support services for African Americans were briefly noted.

Abstract:The present study extended the research on the mental health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth by testing the relationship of social support, social connectedness, and collective self-esteem to psychological well-being in a sample of 218 LGB youth. Perceived social support significantly predicted psychological well-being subscales; social connectedness and collective self-esteem contributed significantly to the psychological well-being of the LGB participants when controlling for perceived social support. Age moderated the relations between several of the social and psychological well-being variables. Results of the study suggest that helping professionals working with LGB youth consider assessment of the youth's sense of connectedness to those around him/her and esteem related to LGB group membership in addition to assessing general social support.

Abstract:Four experiments were conducted to assess two models of topic sentencehood identification: the derived model and the free model. According to the derived model, topic sentences are identified in the context of the paragraph and in terms of how well each sentence in the paragraph captures the paragraph's theme. In contrast, according to the free model, topic sentences can be identified on the basis of sentential features without reference to other sentences in the paragraph (i.e., without context). The results of the experiments suggest that human raters can identify topic sentences both with and without the context of the other sentences in the paragraph. Another goal of this study was to develop computational measures that approximated each of these models. When computational versions were assessed, the results for the free model were promising; however, the derived model results were poor. These results collectively imply that humans' identification of topic sentences in context may rely more heavily on sentential features than on the relationships between sentences in a paragraph.

Title:Predictors of grief following the death of one's child: the contribution of finding meaning.
Authors:['Keesee NJ', 'Currier JM', 'Neimeyer RA']
Affiliation:Memphis Veteran's Administration Medical Center, USA.
Abstract:This study examined the relative contribution of objective risk factors and meaning-making to grief severity among 157 parents who had lost a child to death. Participants completed the Core Bereavement Items (CBI; Burnett, Middleton, Raphael, & Martinek, 1997), Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG; Prigerson et al., 1995), questions assessing the process and degree of sense-making and benefit-finding, and the circumstances surrounding their losses. Results showed that the violence of the death, age of the child at death, and length of bereavement accounted for significant differences in normative grief symptoms (assessed by the CBI). Other results indicated that the cause of death was the only objective risk factor that significantly predicted the intensity of complicated grief (assessed by the ICG). Of the factors examined in this study, sense-making emerged as the most salient predictor of grief severity, with parents who reported having made little to no sense of their child's death being more likely to report greater intensity of grief. Implications for clinical work are discussed.

Title:Biomaterial and antibiotic strategies for peri-implantitis: a review.

Abstract:Dental implants have 89% plus survival rates at 10-15 years, but peri-implantitis or dental implant infections may be as high as 14%. Peri-implantitis can limit clinical success and impose health and financial burdens to patients and health providers. The pathogenic species associated with periodontitis (e.g., Fusobacterium ssp, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis) are also associated with peri-implantitis. Incidence of peri-implantitis is highest within the first 12 months after implantation, and is higher in patients who smoke or have poor oral health as well as with calcium-phosphate-coated or surface-roughened implants. Biomaterial therapies using fibers, gels, and beads to deliver antibiotics have been used in the treatment of Peri-implantitis though clinical efficacy is not well documented. Guided tissue regeneration membranes (e.g., collagen, poly-lactic/glycolic acid, chitosan, ePTFE) loaded with antimicrobials have shown success in reosseointegrating infected implants in animal models but have not been proven in humans. Experimental approaches include the development of anti-bioadhesion coatings, coating surfaces with antimicrobial agents (e.g., vancomycin, Ag, Zn) or antimicrobial releasing coatings (e.g., calcium phosphate, polylactic acid, chitosan). Future strategies include the development of surfaces that become antibacterial in response to infection, and improvements in the permucosal seal. Research is still needed to identify strategies to prevent bacterial attachment and enhance normal cell/tissue attachment to implant surfaces.

Title:Life cycle polyphenism as a factor affecting ecological divergence within Notophthalmus viridescens.
Authors:['Takahashi MK', 'Parris MJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, 38152, USA. mtakahsh@memphis.edu
Abstract:Polyphenism, which allows a single genotype to express multiple discrete phenotypes in response to environmental cues, is an adaptive trait in heterogeneous environments. Pond hydroperiod is an important ecological parameter affecting amphibian life history, and variation in local pond hydrology has been hypothesized to play a role in species divergence via changes in polyphenism. The eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) expresses life cycle polyphenism. Larvae develop along three possible pathways: metamorphosis to aquatic lunged adult via a terrestrial juvenile (eft) stage, metamorphosis directly to an aquatic lunged adult, or maturation directly to an aquatic gilled adult without metamorphosis (i.e., paedomorphosis). Subspecies of N. viridescens vary in their polyphenic patterns, suggesting possible adaptation to different environments. However, no studies have experimentally tested how genetic and environmental components contribute to the observed differences among subspecies and whether such differences may facilitate divergence. We tested whether adaptation to local pond hydrology via polyphenic changes existed among subspecies by rearing larvae of three subspecies (N. v. dorsalis, N. v. louisianensis, and N. v. viridescens) along three hydroperiod regimes (short, long, and constant) in outdoor artificial ponds. We found that larval N. v. viridescens obligately metamorphosed to efts under all hydroperiods, whereas N. v. dorsalis and N. v. louisianensis exhibited plasticity: larvae metamorphosed to efts under drying conditions but metamorphosed directly to aquatic adults or became paedomorphic in constant water. Also, N. v. viridescens metamorphosed to efts faster and at a smaller body size than the other two subspecies. These data suggest that subspecies of N. viridescens are adapted to different pond hydroperiods, supporting the potential for polyphenism to facilitate divergence. Canalizing selection for certain alternative phenotypes within a single species in which other populations remain plastic may play an important role in the initiation of ecological divergence.

Title:Bioinformatic analysis reveals cRel as a regulator of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes.

Abstract:Interferons (IFNs) are critical to the host innate immune response by inducing the expression of a family of early response genes, denoted as IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The role of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins in the transcription activation of ISGs is well-documented. Recent studies have indicated that other transcription factors (TFs) are likely to play a role in regulating ISG expression. Here, we describe a novel integrative approach that combines gene expression profiling, promoter sequence analysis, and literature mining to screen candidate regulatory factors in the IFN signal transduction pathway. Application of this method identified the nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) protein, cRel, as a candidate regulatory factor for a subset of ISGs in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and real-time PCR assays confirmed that cRel directly binds to the promoters of several ISGs, including Cxcl10, Isg15, Gbp2, Ifit3, and Ifi203, and regulates their expression. Thus, our studies identify cRel as an important TF for ISGs, and validate the approach of using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)-based methods to identify regulatory factors from microarray data.

Title:Obesity in America.
Authors:['Menifield CE', 'Doty N', 'Fletcher A']
Affiliation:Division of Public and Nonprofit Administration, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. cmenifld@memphis.edu
Abstract:Recent data indicate that Americans are gaining weight at an alarming rate. In fact, data from the CDC indicate that the U.S. obesity average was 12% in 1990 and had grown to 23% by 2005. In recent years, this problem appears to be more prominent in some southern states than in other states. The purpose of this study was to determine what factors were associated with increased levels of obesity. Do demographic, educational, healthcare, or economic factors correlate with this trend? Using state level data in a fixed effects regression model we examined obesity rates for the period 1990-2003. We also used cross tabulation tables to compare obesity rates to several independent variables. Our analysis revealed that obesity was related to several health, demographic, and economic factors. As a result, we argue that policy makers as well as health officials should take a comprehensive look at obesity as well as other social ills, health care conditions, and related issues prior to creating a plan to improve health in this country.

Title:Modifications of human carboxylesterase for improved prodrug activation.
Authors:['Hatfield JM', 'Wierdl M', 'Wadkins RM', 'Potter PM']
Affiliation:Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Carboxylesterases (CEs) are ubiquitous enzymes responsible for the hydrolysis of numerous clinically useful drugs. As ester moieties are frequently included in molecules to improve their water solubility and bioavailability, de facto they become substrates for CEs. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we describe the properties of human CEs with regard to their ability to activate anticancer prodrugs and demonstrate how structure-based design can be used to modulate substrate specificity and to increase efficiency of hydrolysis. METHODS: A specific example using CPT-11 and a human liver CE is discussed. However, these techniques can be applied to other enzymes and their associated prodrugs. RESULTS: Structure-guided mutagenesis of CEs can be employed to alter substrate specificity and generate novel enzymes that are efficacious at anticancer prodrug activation.

Title:Vibrational spectra of phenyltriethoxysilane, phenyltrimethoxysilane and their sol-gels.
Authors:['Li YS', 'Wang Y', 'Ceesay S']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-6060, USA. yingli@memphis.edu
Abstract:Raman and infrared spectra of phenyltriethoxysilane and phenyltrimethoxysilane have been recorded. These silane coupling agents (SCAs) have been used as precursors to prepare sol-gels using acid or base as catalyst under different solution conditions. From the vibrational spectroscopic identification, it was found that the major sol-gel products obtained from different catalysts and different solvents were essentially the same. Vibrational assignments for the SCAs, sol-gel and xerogel have been made based on the group frequencies, the spectral variation collected at different physical and chemical states and the previous spectroscopic studies of similar molecules. The compositions of xerogels after thermal treatments at different temperatures have been analyzed and identified by using infrared spectroscopic method along with thermal gravimetric analysis. Results from the experimental treatments for the xerogels indicated that the xerogel baking at 118 degrees C served to evaporate the sample moisture, the curing at 225 degrees C helped to complete the condensation reaction, and the treatment at 600 degrees C caused the decomposition of the organic group but the siloxane net-work remained essentially unchanged.

Title:Blood oxidative stress biomarkers: influence of sex, exercise training status, and dietary intake.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ', 'Fisher-Wellman KH']
Affiliation:Department of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Sex and lifestyle factors are known to influence the oxidation of protein, lipids, and DNA. Biomarkers such as protein carbonyls (PC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) have been commonly used in an attempt to characterize the oxidative status of human subjects. OBJECTIVE: This study compared resting blood oxidative stress biomarkers, in relation to exercise training status and dietary intake, between men and women. METHODS: Exercise-trained and sedentary men and women (with normal menstrual cycles; reporting during the early follicular phase) were recruited from the University of Memphis, Tennessee, campus and surrounding community via recruitment flyers and word of mouth. Participants were categorized by sex and current exercise training status (ie, trained or untrained). Each completed a detailed 5-day food record of all food and drink consumed. Diets were analyzed for kilocalories and macro- and micronutrient (vitamins C, E, A) intake. Venous blood samples were obtained at rest and analyzed for PC, MDA, and 8-OHdG. RESULTS: In the 131 participants (89 men, of whom 74 were exercise trained and 15 untrained, and 42 women, of whom 22 were exercise trained and 20 untrained; mean [SD] age, 24 [4] years), PC did not differ significantly between trained men and women or between untrained men and women. However, trained participants had significantly lower plasma PC (measured in nmol . mg protein(-1)) (mean [SEM] 0.0966 [0.0055]) than did untrained participants (0.1036 [0.0098]) (P < 0.05). MDA levels (measured in micromol . L(-1)) were significantly lower in trained women (0.4264 [0.0559]) compared with trained men (0.6959 [0.0593]); in trained men and women combined (0.5621 [0.0566]) compared with untrained men and women combined (0.7397 [0.0718]); and in women combined (0.5665 [0.0611]) compared with men combined (0.7338 [0.0789]) (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). No significant differences were noted between any groups for 8-OHdG. Neither PC nor 8-OHdG were correlated to any dietary variable, with the exception of PC and percent of protein in untrained men (r = 0.552; P = 0.033). MDA was positively correlated to protein intake and negatively correlated to percent of carbohydrate and vitamin C intake, primarily in trained men (P < or = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of young healthy adults, oxidative stress was lower in women than in men and in trained compared with untrained individuals, particularly regarding MDA. With the exception of MDA primarily in trained men, dietary intake did not appear to be correlated to biomarkers of oxidative stress.

Title:The effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions for bereaved persons: a comprehensive quantitative review.
Authors:['Currier JM', 'Neimeyer RA', 'Berman JS']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology. Department of Psychology. Department of Psychology.
Abstract:Previous quantitative reviews of research on psychotherapeutic interventions for bereaved persons have yielded divergent findings and have not included many of the available controlled outcome studies. This meta-analysis summarizes results from 61 controlled studies to offer a more comprehensive integration of this literature. This review examined (a) the absolute effectiveness of bereavement interventions immediately following intervention and at follow-up assessments, (b) several of the clinically and theoretically relevant moderators of outcome, and (c) change over time among recipients of the interventions and individuals in no-intervention control groups. Overall, analyses showed that interventions had a small effect at posttreatment but no statistically significant benefit at follow-up. However, interventions that exclusively targeted grievers displaying marked difficulties adapting to loss had outcomes that compare favorably with psychotherapies for other difficulties. Other evidence suggested that the discouraging results for studies failing to screen for indications of distress could be attributed to a tendency among controls to improve naturally over time. The findings of the review underscore the importance of attending to the targeted population in the practice and study of psychotherapeutic interventions for bereaved persons.

Title:Temporal predictability in food availability: effects upon the reproductive axis in Scrub-Jays.
Authors:['Bridge ES', 'Schoech SJ', 'Bowman R', 'Wingfield JC']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. brid0030@tc.umn.edu
Abstract:Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) in a suburban environment with year-round access to multiple sources of abundant, human-source foods consistently breed earlier each year and have lower baseline levels of circulating corticosterone (CORT) than jays in a nearby wildland setting. These findings suggest that food supplies influence CORT levels, which in turn may partially determine the timing of reproduction. However, wildland birds with access to high-quality supplemental foods did not advance breeding or lower CORT levels to the degree observed in the suburbs. Therefore, rather than quality or quantity of food consumed, the perception of a reliable and predictable food supply may be an important factor in determining laying dates. If a predictable food supply accelerates the reproductive process, it follows that food provided on an unpredictable schedule may slow reproduction. We subjected captive Western Scrub-Jays (A. californica) to a 30-day photoperiod transition from short- to long-days and tested whether birds with access to food on an unpredictable schedule exhibited delayed or reduced production of reproductive hormones compared with birds given food on a predictable schedule. Baseline CORT concentrations increased slightly during the experiment, but did not differ between treatment groups. Birds with unpredictable food had slightly lower testosterone levels relative to controls, but there was no effect on estradiol or luteinizing hormone. Our findings offer weak support for the hypothesis that an unpredictable food supply will delay the onset of reproduction; however, the artificial lab environment may limit the application of these findings to free-living populations.

Abstract:The underlying pathways that lead to relapse in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are unknown. To comprehensively characterize the molecular evolution of relapsed childhood B-precursor ALL, we used human 500K single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to identify somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) in 20 diagnosis/relapse pairs relative to germ line. We identified 758 CNAs, 66.4% of which were less than 1 Mb, and deletions outnumbered amplifications by approximately 2.5:1. Although CNAs persisting from diagnosis to relapse were observed in all 20 cases, 17 patients exhibited differential CNA patterns from diagnosis to relapse. Of the 396 CNAs observed in 20 relapse samples, only 69 (17.4%) were novel (absent in the matched diagnosis samples). EBF1 and IKZF1 deletions were particularly frequent in this relapsed ALL cohort (25.0% and 35.0%, respectively), suggesting their role in disease recurrence. In addition, we noted concordance in global gene expression and DNA copy number changes (P = 2.2 x 10(-16)). Finally, relapse-specific focal deletion of MSH6 and, consequently, reduced gene expression were found in 2 of 20 cases. In an independent cohort of children with ALL, reduced expression of MSH6 was associated with resistance to mercaptopurine and prednisone, thereby providing a plausible mechanism by which this acquired deletion contributes to drug resistance at relapse.

Title:The waterpipe: time for action.
Authors:['Maziak W']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Syrian Center for Tobacco Studies, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. wmaziak@memphis.edu
Abstract:The waterpipe, known in many cultures under different shapes and names (e.g. hookah, shisha, narghile), is a centuries-old tobacco use method that is witnessing a world-wide surge in popularity. This popularity is most noticeable among youths, and is surpassing cigarette smoking among this group in some societies. Many factors may have contributed to the recent waterpipe spread, including the introduction of sweetened/flavored waterpipe tobacco (known as Maassel), its reduced-harm perception, the thriving cafe culture, mass media and the internet. The passage of smoke through water on its way to the smoker underlies much of the common misperception that waterpipe use is less harmful than cigarettes. The health/addictive profile of waterpipe compared to cigarettes is largely unresearched and is likely to be influenced by the properties of smoke, duration and frequency of use, type of tobacco used, volume of smoke inhaled and the contribution of charcoal. However, the accumulation of evidence about the harmful and addictive potential of waterpipe use is outpacing the public health response to this health risk. A timely public health and policy action is needed in order to curb the emerging waterpipe smoking epidemic.

Title:Controlled loading of building blocks into temporary self-assembled scaffolds for directed assembly of organic nanostructures.

Abstract:Using temporary self-assembled scaffolds to preorganize building blocks is a potentially powerful method for the synthesis of organic nanostructures with programmed shapes. We examined the underlying phenomena governing the loading of hydrophobic monomers into lipid bilayer interior and demonstrated successful control of the amount and ratio of loaded monomers. When excess styrene derivatives or acrylates were added to the aqueous solution of unilamellar liposomes made from saturated phospholipids, most loading occurs within the first few hours. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy revealed no evidence of aggregation caused by monomers. Bilayers appeared to have a certain capacity for accommodating monomers. The total volume of loaded monomers is independent of monomer structure. X-ray scattering showed the increase in bilayer thickness consistent with loading monomers into bilayer interior. Loading kinetics is inversely proportional to the hydrophobicity and size of monomers. Loading and extraction kinetic data suggest that crossing the polar heads region is the rate limiting step. Consideration of loading kinetics and multiple equilibria are important for achieving reproducible monomer loading. The total amount of monomers loaded into the bilayer can be controlled by the loading time or length of hydrophobic lipid tails. The ratio of loaded monomers can be varied by changing the ratio of monomers used for loading or by the time-controlled replacement of a preloaded monomer. Understanding and controlling the loading of monomers into bilayers contributes to the directed assembly of organic nanostructures.

Title:Embodied relations are encoded in language.
Authors:['Louwerse MM']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Institute for Intelligent Systems, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. mlouwerse@memphis.edu
Abstract:Studies of embodied cognition have shown that comprehenders process iconic word pairs (attic-basement) more quickly than reverse-iconic pairs (basement-attic) when the pairs are presented to them in a vertical spatial arrangement. This effect disappears in a horizontal spatial arrangement. This has been claimed to show that comprehenders perceptually simulate these word pairs. A complementary explanation is that linguistic conceptualizations (word order) reflect prelinguistic conceptualizations (spatial iconicity), whereby comprehenders use these linguistic conceptualizations in the comprehension process. The results of corpus linguistic, rating, and semantic judgment studies reported here supported this explanation: Iconic word pairs were more frequent than reverse-iconic word pairs; frequency of word order explained response times in a semantic judgment task better than iconicity did; and when iconic word pairs were presented in a horizontal arrangement, the iconicity effect disappeared, but the word order effect remained. These findings show that spatial iconicity patterns are reflected in word order patterns and that comprehenders are sensitive to these word order patterns in language-processing tasks.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Despite the importance of equal access to prescription drugs by racial and ethnic groups, studies on access to prescription drugs have been incomprehensive. OBJECTIVE: To describe the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) as a valuable data source to study racial and ethnic disparities in prescription drug use. METHODS: Use of the MEPS database to study disparities in prescription drug use is detailed. This includes strengths and limitations of the database, as well as key methodological, sampling, and statistical issues to consider when using it. RESULTS: Using MEPS allows researchers to control for sociodemographic and health status information when studying racial and ethnic disparities in prescription drug use. MEPS has taken measures to improve reliability of the information on the utilization of prescription drugs. An additional benefit of MEPS is that it has oversampled Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians; as such, it affords the statistical power to examine these minority groups. One limitation of MEPS is the inability of researchers to study some drug categories, because of limitations in statistical power. Moreover, the names of the prescription medications are not standardized in MEPS, and some information is not publicly available in MEPS databases. When conducting studies requiring information not publicly available, researchers may commute to the MEPS Data Center or may request the Data Center to run statistical programs for them. CONCLUSIONS: Using MEPS to study racial and ethnic disparities in prescription drug use has significant benefits. Nonetheless, researchers need to keep in mind the limitations of using MEPS.

Abstract:Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration and proliferation are critical events in the development of neointima following vascular injury. In this study, we found that CD9 is constitutively expressed in the VSMC of the neointima of injured carotid arteries. The in vitro migration and proliferation of human coronary artery smooth muscle (hCASM) cells were reduced by 40% and 63%, respectively, by treatment with a CD9 specific monoclonal antibody mAb7 when compared to control antibody treatment. In a mouse carotid ligation injury model, a single application of a neutralizing anti-mouse CD9 antibody resulted in a 31% (day 14, n=8, p<0.05), and 32% (day 28, n=5, p<0.01) reduction in neointima formation. In support of these findings, exogenous expression of human CD9 by CD9-adenoviral transduction led to 43% increases in neointima (p<0.05, n=6). Upon investigation of the mechanisms underlying CD9 mediated VSMC phenotypic events we found that integrin alpha5beta1 was a constitutive partner of CD9 and that CD9 significantly augmented PI-3 kinase dependent Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, enhanced Akt phosphorylation was attenuated by mAb7 binding. Cumulatively, a functional link between CD9, alpha5beta1, PI3-K/Akt activity and enhanced VSMC migratory and proliferative phenotypes has been demonstrated. These studies suggest that agents that modulate CD9 mediated VSMC phenotypes may emerge as novel strategies for the treatment of abnormal vascular injury response.

Title:Gonadal hormones modulate sex differences in judgments of relative numerousness in meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus.
Authors:['Ferkin MH', 'Pierce AA', 'Sealand RO']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Biology Department, Ellington Hall, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. mhferkin@memphis.edu
Abstract:Animals in a variety of taxa discriminate between a greater quantity and a lesser quantity of the same object, an ability that is referred to as relative numerousness judgment. For example, meadow voles can distinguish between areas containing more over-marks by one opposite-sex scent donor and fewer over-marks by another opposite-sex scent donor. Females appear to be able to make better discriminations between more or less over-marks than do males. In that gonadal hormones have been implicated in modulating cognitive function associated with spatial tasks, we tested the hypothesis that high titers of testosterone and estradiol are necessary for male and female voles, respectively, to distinguish between the top- and bottom-scent donors in an area containing mixed over-marks. We gonadectomized voles, giving them either gonadal hormone replacement (testosterone for males and estradiol for females) or no hormone replacement, and tested their spontaneous judgments of distinguishing between the top- and bottom-scent donors in an area containing mixed over-marks; a task involving judgments of relative numerousness. Female voles given replacement estradiol performed better than did female voles not given replacement estradiol in determining the top-scent and bottom-scent males in areas containing mixed over-marks. In contrast, males not treated with replacement testosterone performed better than did males treated with testosterone in determining the top-scent and bottom-scent males in areas containing mixed over-marks. Thus, high titers of estradiol and low titers of testosterone are associated with better performance on tasks involving relative numerousness in female and male voles, respectively. The results of this task on relative numerousness judgments are discussed in relation to the effects of gonadal steroid hormone on spatial ability, a closely related cognitive domain, and the social biology of meadow voles.

Title:Central blockade of oxytocin receptors during mid-late gestation reduces amplitude of slow afterhyperpolarization in supraoptic oxytocin neurons.

Abstract:The neurohypophysial hormone oxytocin (OT), synthesized in magnocellular paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei, is well known for its effects in lactation. Our previous studies showed that central OT receptor (OTR) binding is increased during gestation and that blockade of central OTRs, specifically during mid-late gestation, causes a delay in OT release during suckling and reduces weight gain in pups, suggesting decreased milk delivery. In the present study, we tested whether central OTR blockade during late gestation disrupts the gestation-related plasticity in intrinsic membrane properties. Whole cell current-clamp recordings were performed in OT neurons from pregnant rats (19-22 days in gestation) that were infused with an OTR antagonist (OTA) or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) and from virgin rats infused with aCSF into the third ventricle via an osmotic minipump beginning on days 12-14 of gestation. The amplitudes of both Ca(2+)-dependent afterhyperpolarizations (AHPs), an apamin-sensitive medium AHP (mAHP) and an apamin-insensitive slow AHP (sAHP), were significantly increased during late gestation in control pregnant animals. However, the amplitude of the sAHP from pregnant rats treated with the OTA was significantly smaller than that of pregnant control rats and similar to that of virgins. These results indicate that the diminished efficiency in lactation due to OTR blockade may be partly a result of an altered sAHP that would shape OT bursting. These findings suggest that central actions of OT during late gestation are necessary for programming the plasticity of at least some of the intrinsic membrane properties in OT neurons during lactation.

Title:Current considerations in pediatric speech audiometry.
Authors:['Mendel LL']

Abstract:Current considerations in pediatric speech perception assessment are highlighted in this article with a focus on specific test principles and variables that must be addressed when evaluating speech perception performance in children. Existing test materials are reviewed with an emphasis on the level of sensitivity and standardization that they have for accurate assessment of a child's speech perception performance. A test battery approach is advocated because speech perception is an abstract construct, and in order to provide a comprehensive assessment of a child's capabilities, information is needed from several sources of concrete data. The importance of ongoing speech perception assessment in children is also emphasized because a child's progress over time must be monitored to determine if improvements need to be made with amplification and intervention efforts. Results from pediatric speech perception assessments can provide practical information regarding the prognosis of speech, language, reading, and cognitive abilities of children as well as steps that need to be taken in the intervention process.

Title:Properties of antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cements for use in cemented arthroplasties: a state-of-the-art review.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:Infection of periprosthetic sites of total joint replacements has been widely reported. Although, by most accounts, the incidence of such events is low, the problem can prove to be expensive to remedy. In the case of cemented arthroplasties, a common management modality is the use of antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement (ALABC) as a prophylaxis or a therapeutic agent. Although there is a large literature on properties of ALABCs (on the order of 100 journal articles), a comprehensive review is lacking. The present contribution, whose objective is to fill this gap, is organized in four parts. Details of the background to and motivation for the work are given in the first part, explicative summaries of literature studies on the influence of various factors on an array of in vitro and in vivo properties of ALABCs are covered in the second part, issues and areas for future studies are presented in the third part, and the fourth part contains a summary of the most salient points made in the review.

Title:Rotational hydrodynamic diffusion system to study mass transport across boundaries.
Authors:['Mamidi SS', 'Meas B', 'Farhat TR']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, Analytical Division, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-3550, USA.
Abstract:The design and operation of a new mass transport technique is presented. Rotational hydrodynamic diffusion system (RHDS) is a method that can be adapted for analytical laboratory analysis as well as industrial-scale separation and purification. Although RHDS is not an electrochemical technique, its concept is derived from hydrodynamic rotating disk electrode voltammetry. A diffusion advantage gained using the RHDS is higher flux of probe molecules across the boundary (e.g., membrane or porous media) with increased rotation rate compared to the static two-half-cell (THC) method. The separation concept of RHDS differs from pressurized, agitated, electrodialysis, and reversed osmosis systems in design and theory. The detection mechanism of the RHDS opens the possibility to study mass transport properties of a large variety of molecules using different types of ultrathin membranes. Therefore, the RHDS is a potential alternative to classical mass transport detection methods such as THC, impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic and rotating disk electrode voltammetry. Theoretical analysis on the rotational hydrodynamic flux is derived and compared to experimental flux measured using HCl, KCl, KNO 3, Ni(NO 3) 2, LiCl, camphor sulfonic acid, and K 3Fe(CN) 6 ionic solutions. Values of effective diffusion coefficients of salts across Nucleopore membranes of thickness 6.0 and 10 mum with pore size 0.1 and 0.2 mum, respectively, are presented and discussed.

Title:Narrow-band oscillations in probabilistic cellular automata.
Authors:['Puljic M', 'Kozma R']
Affiliation:Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152-3240, USA. neuropercolation@yahoo.com
Abstract:Dynamical properties of neural populations are studied using probabilistic cellular automata. Previous work demonstrated the emergence of critical behavior as the function of system noise and density of long-range axonal connections. Finite-size scaling theory identified critical properties, which were consistent with properties of a weak Ising universality class. The present work extends the studies to neural populations with excitatory and inhibitory interactions. It is shown that the populations can exhibit narrow-band oscillations when confined to a range of inhibition levels, with clear boundaries marking the parameter region of prominent oscillations. Phase diagrams have been constructed to characterize unimodal, bimodal, and quadromodal oscillatory states. The significance of these findings is discussed in the context of large-scale narrow-band oscillations in neural tissues, as observed in electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic measurements.

Title:Isolation of mannose-binding C-type lectin from sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) plasma and binding to Aeromonas salmonicida.

Abstract:The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is a parasitic cartilaginous fish of the North American Great Lakes and a predator of many bony fish species of commercial importance to the fishing industry. Mannose-binding C-type lectin (MBL) was isolated by mannan-agarose affinity chromatography from sea lamprey plasma. Mannose-binding lectin has not before been identified and quantitated in the plasma of this sea lamprey species. The affinity-purified and 2-ME reduced lamprey MBL showed two bands of 35kDa and 65kDa by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using guinea pig anti-MBL IgG as the primary antibody. Amino acid composition analysis (mol%) of the purified lamprey MBL found high amounts of histidine, threonine, tyrosine and phenylalanine present when compared with three other vertebrate MBLs. N-terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation for the first 10 residues gave XXXTKGCPDA. Lamprey plasma contained 261mug of MBL/ml of plasma. Plasma protein concentration was 40.1mg/ml. Lamprey MBL was present then in plasma at 6.5mug MBL/mg total protein. The sea lamprey MBL also specifically binds to mannose on the surface of the pathogen Aeromonas salmonicida. The presence of MBL in high concentration in lamprey plasma could be important in their innate immunity and resistance to infection. This study describes the presence of MBL in sea lamprey plasma and evidence for a C-type lectin complement pathway of innate immunity.

Abstract:Glucocorticoids mediate glucose availability under stressful and non-stressful conditions and, therefore, are essential for life. However, data across taxa demonstrate that chronic or elevated secretion of corticosterone or cortisol (CORT) can have negative effects at many levels and can trigger physiological or behavioral responses that may delay or, even halt reproduction. We present a brief overview of the effects that glucocorticoids, primarily the avian form, corticosterone, can have on the reproductive axis. Considerable data have demonstrated that environmental perturbations can result in elevated CORT levels that alter a bird's investment in current reproduction. Studies in our laboratory have shown a link between CORT and timing of reproduction in Florida scrub-jays: in "bad" years, clutch initiation dates are positively correlated with baseline CORT levels of female breeders. Also, population-level differences in CORT levels may explain timing of reproduction as lower CORT levels in suburban-dwelling jays are coupled with early breeding. Most research on stress and CORT concentrates on transient effects of CORT secretion. However, developmental CORT exposure, either from the yolk or embryo, may have long-term effects upon adult phenotype. For example, CORT levels in nestling scrub-jays predicts later 'personality,' as levels were highly correlated (r(2)=0.84) with fearfulness at 7 months of age. One can imagine that such 'personality' traits might also translate into differential success in gaining a territory or a mate. While speculative, it may be that early CORT exposure effectively programs adult behaviors that have wide ranging effects, including upon reproduction.

Abstract:The analyses of 2-ethylhexyl-p-methoxycinnamate (EHMC) using HPLC and Raman spectroscopy have been undertaken and compared. EHMC, which is one of the most widely used sunscreen agents in suncare products in the US, exhibits a strong Raman signal. This signal clearly appears in both ethanol solutions of EHMC as well as in commercial sunscreen lotions containing this sun screen agent. A method for the direct detection and analysis of EHMC has been developed using Raman spectroscopy. This was accomplished by correlating the Raman intensities with the HPLC assays for a series of prototype suncare formulations. Based upon this information, it would be possible to employ Raman spectroscopy as an in-process control method in the commercial production of suncare products containing EHMC. The possibility of applying surface-enhanced Raman scattering for trace analysis was discussed.

Abstract:A silver oxide hydrosol has been prepared by reacting silver nitrate with sodium hydroxide in an aqueous solution. The colloidal particle composition and particle size have been characterized by X-ray diffractometry and transmittance electron microscopy. We have demonstrated that the sol is surface-enhanced Raman scattering active. One major advantage of this sol is the absence of the spectral interference arising from reaction products of the sol formation process. The mechanism of surface-enhanced Raman scattering activity is essentially contributed by the silver particles generated from the photochemical process during the laser excitation.

Abstract:Computerized agility training (CAT) products are frequently suggested to improve agility. However, these claims often are made without unbiased scientific support. Therefore, the purpose of this study was (a) to determine the reliability and effectiveness of a 4-week CAT training program on foot speed (FS) and choice reaction (REACT), and (b) to assess whether training on the CAT would facilitate the improvement of a separate change-of-direction (COD) test in non-agility-trained, but active, men and women. Twenty-three participants (15 men, 8 women) pre- and posttested on FS, REACT, and COD drills. Eleven of those participants (7 men, 4 women) engaged in 4 weeks of training on the FS and REACT drills (EX). The remaining 12 (8 men, 4 women) did not participate in the training and served as controls (CON). Coefficients of variation indicate strong precision for FS (6.9%) and REACT (2.6%). Test-retest reliability, as analyzed by intraclass correlations (ICC), were high for both FS and REACT (0.89). Significant test-by-group interactions were observed for all three tests: FS (p = 0.004), REACT (p = 0.011), and COD (p = 0.049). Post hoc analysis indicated that EX increased foot contacts for the FS drill (p = 0.006), whereas REACT and COD demonstrated decreases in time to completion (p = 0.013 and 0.038, respectively). The CON group did not improve on any of the tests. This study indicates that the chosen CAT is an accurate and reliable tool for measuring foot speed and reaction time. These data justify the use of this CAT in analyzing foot speed and reaction time. Altogether, 4 weeks of foot speed and reaction training on the chosen CAT produced improvements in overall agility in non-agility-trained, but active, men and women. These data warrant the integration of such a device into the training program of untrained athletes attempting to improve agility.

Title:Kinetic comparison of free weight and machine power cleans.

Abstract:The purpose of this investigation was to compare the kinetic characteristics of the power clean exercise using either free weight or machine resistance. After familiarization, 14 resistance trained men (mean +/- SD; age = 24.9 +/- 6.2 years) participated in two testing sessions. During the initial testing session, one-repetition maximum performance (1RM) was assessed in either the free weight or machine power clean from the midthigh. This was followed by kinetic assessment of either the free weight or the machine power clean at 85% of 1RM. One week after the initial testing session, 1RM performance, as well as the subsequent kinetic evaluation, were performed for the alternate exercise modality. All performance measures were obtained using a computer-interfaced FiTROdyne dynamometer (Fitronic; Bratislava, Slovakia). Maximum strength (1RM) and average power were significantly greater for the free weight condition, whereas peak velocity and average velocity were greater for the machine condition (p < 0.05). Although peak power was not different between modalities, force at peak power (free weights = 1445 +/- 266 N, machine = 1231 +/- 194 N) and velocity at peak power (free weights = 1.77 +/- 0.28 m x s(-1), machine = 2.20 +/- 0.24 m x s(-1)) were different (p < 0.05). It seems that mechanical limitations of the machine modality (i.e., lift trajectory) result in different load capacities that produce different kinetic characteristics for these two lifting modalities.

Title:Development of chitosan-ellagic acid films as a local drug delivery system to induce apoptotic death of human melanoma cells.

Abstract:This study was designed to develop a local chemotherapy device using chitosan as a local drug carrier and ellagic acid (EA) as an anticancer drug. We fabricated chitosan-ellagic acid (Ch-EA) films with concentrations of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1% (w/v) of EA and examined the films using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and contact angle measurement. The WM115 human melanoma cell line as a skin cancer model was used to evaluate cell response to the films with the MTS assay and apoptosis assay, and HS68 human newborn fibroblast cell line as a control. With the increase in the concentration of the EA, the composite films exhibit increasing amide and ester groups and diffraction peaks of the crystallized EA and greater surface roughness and hydrophilicity. The chitosan films with 0.5 and 1% (w/v) of EA were found to have a potent antiproliferative effect on the melanoma cells by inducing apoptotic cell death. Localized effect of composites on cell behaviors has been clearly demonstrated. Our study demonstrated that the novel Ch-EA film can be potentially used in local chemotherapy.

Abstract:To build on the growing literature on interpersonal relationships among individuals with PTSD, this study examined the separate influences of PTSD symptoms and depression on functioning with friends, romantic partners, and family. To examine the influence of measurement, both interviewer-rated assessment of interpersonal functioning and self-reported assessment of perceived social support were included. The sample included 109 community members who sought help for mental health problems in the aftermath of a serious motor vehicle accident. Building on previous research, hierarchical regression models were used to examine the impact of re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal on relationship functioning, followed by depression. Results suggest that assessment modality makes a difference in understanding factors contributing to interpersonal strain. When assessed by an interviewer, depression seems to play a larger role in interpersonal strain, relative to PTSD symptoms. When assessed via self-reported perceived social support, weaker associations were observed, which highlighted the role of emotional numbing. Results are discussed in light of the possible role that PTSD comorbidity with depression plays in interpersonal functioning following a traumatic event, with implications for future research.

Title:Can exercise minimize postprandial oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes?

Abstract:It has recently been estimated by the American Diabetes Association that 21 million Americans, or about 7% of the U.S. population, have diabetes, while an additional 54 million Americans have pre-diabetes. The onset and progression of these disorders and related complications are linked to impairments in glucose and lipid metabolism, both of which are associated with increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). Increased RONS production coupled with impaired antioxidant defense (a common finding among patients with diabetes) promotes oxidation of specific biomolecules (lipid, protein, DNA), which can lead to an exacerbation of diabetic complications. While bloodborne variables related to these disorders have traditionally been measured in a fasted state, increasing evidence suggests that measurement of postprandial glycemia, lipemia, and oxidative stress may provide more important clinical information concerning an individual's susceptibility to diabetes onset and disease progression. While drugs to treat hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia have been reported in some studies to promote favorable outcomes related to attenuating the postprandial rise in blood glucose and triglycerides, one non-pharmaceutical approach which may have promise is the performance of regular exercise. Both acute and chronic exercise may aid in attenuating postprandial oxidative stress in three distinct ways. First, exercise stimulates an increase in endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity. Second, exercise improves blood glucose clearance via enhanced GLUT 4 translocation and protein content, as well as enhanced insulin-insulin receptor binding and post-receptor signaling. Third, exercise improves blood triglyceride clearance via a reduced chylomicron-triglyceride half-life and enhanced lipoprotein lipase activity. In this article we provide evidence for the potential role of exercise in modulating postprandial oxidative stress in diabetic and pre-diabetic individuals. It is certainly possible that exercise may prove beneficial in this regard. If so, and in accordance with the recent joint initiative of the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Medical Association, exercise may be viewed as "medicine" for individuals who are at increased risk for postprandial oxidative stress.

Abstract:The purpose of this investigation was to examine the extent to which item and text characteristics predict item difficulty on the comprehension portion of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Tests for the 7th-9th and 10th-12th grade levels. Detailed item-based analyses were performed on 192 comprehension questions on the basis of the cognitive processing model framework proposed by Embretson and colleagues (Embretson & Wetzel, 1987). Item difficulty was analyzed in terms of various passage features (e.g., word frequency and number of propositions) and individual-question characteristics (e.g., abstractness and degree of inferential processing), using hierarchical linear modeling. The results indicated that the difficulty of the items in the test for the 7th-9th grade level is primarily influenced by text features--in particular, vocabulary difficulty--whereas the difficulty of the items in the test for the 10th-12th grade level is less systematically influenced by text features.

Abstract:Dynamic adaptation is a key feature of brains helping to maintain the quality of their performance in the face of increasingly difficult constraints. How to achieve high-quality performance under demanding real-time conditions is an important question in the study of cognitive behaviors. Animals and humans are embedded in and constrained by their environments. Our goal is to improve the understanding of the dynamics of the interacting brain-environment system by studying human behaviors when completing constrained tasks and by modeling the observed behavior. In this article we present results of experiments with humans performing tasks on the computer under variable time and resource constraints. We compare various models of behavior generation in order to describe the observed human performance. Finally we speculate on mechanisms how chaotic neurodynamics can contribute to the generation of flexible human behaviors under constraints.

Title:Effect of exercise on oxidative stress biomarkers.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Department of Health and Sport Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu
Abstract:Acute bouts of aerobic and anaerobic exercise can induce a state of oxidative stress, as indicated by an increase in oxidized molecules in a variety of tissues and body fluids. The extent of oxidation is dependent on the exercise mode, intensity, and duration, and is specifically related to the degree of oxidant production. Findings of increased oxidative stress have been reported for both healthy and diseased subjects following single bouts of exercise. While acute exercise has the ability to induce an oxidative stress, this same exercise stimulus appears necessary to allow for an upregulation in endogenous antioxidant defenses. This chapter presents a summary of exercise-induced oxidative stress.

Title:Chronic insulin treatment suppresses PTP1B function, induces increased PDGF signaling, and amplifies neointima formation in the balloon-injured rat artery.

Abstract:We tested the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia induces the suppression of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) function, leading to enhanced PDGF receptor (PDGFR) signaling and neointimal hyperplasia. Rats were implanted with insulin-releasing pellets or sham pellets. Blood glucose levels, insulin levels, food and water intake, body weights, and blood pressures were measured. Neointimal hyperplasia was assessed by computerized morphometry 14 days after carotid balloon injury. PTP1B protein expression in injured arteries was determined via Western blot analysis, whereas PTP1B activity was determined via an immunophosphatase assay. Serum insulin levels were two- to threefold greater in hyperinsulinemic rats, whereas systolic blood pressures, food and water intake, serum triglyceride levels, plasma cortisol levels, and urinary catecholamine levels were not affected. Fourteen days after injury, neointima-to-media area ratios were 0.89 +/- 0.23 and 1.35 +/- 0.22 in control and hyperinsulinemic rats, respectively (P < 0.01). PTP1B protein levels and total PTP1B activity in injured carotid arteries from the insulin-treated group were significantly decreased 7 or 14 days after injury, whereas PTP1B specific activity was decreased only 14 days after injury. These findings were associated with decreased PTP1B mRNA levels and increased PDGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation in insulin-treated rats. These observations support the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia induces the suppression of PTP1B function, leading to enhanced PDGFR signaling and neointimal hyperplasia.

Title:Oocyte maturation: converting the zebrafish oocyte to the fertilizable egg.
Authors:['Lessman CA']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, The University of Memphis, 3774 Walker Ave., Room 223 Life Science Bldg., Memphis, TN 38152, USA. Clessman@memphis.edu
Abstract:The process of oogenesis culminates in steroid-induced oocyte maturation to produce the fertilizable egg. A quintessential biological entity, the egg is central to the production of new individuals. The result of egg fertilization by a sperm cell is the production of the mother of all stem cells (i.e. the zygote). Furthermore, the egg cytoplasm is the only one known to support reprogramming a transplanted nucleus to give rise to an individual (i.e. animal cloning). Zebrafish oocyte maturation is a complex event encompassing a number of cellular changes including germinal vesicle migration (GVM) and dissolution or breakdown (GVD), ooplasmic clearing (OC) with correlated yolk protein changes (YP), development of osmoregulation (OR) in fresh water, the formation of the future embryonic pole, the blastodisc (BF) and activatibility (AC) or cortical maturation. In zebrafish, and many other teleosts, 17alpha, 20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17alpha, 20beta-DP) has been shown to be the normal inducer of oocyte maturation. A 17alpha, 20beta-DP membrane-resident receptor mediates oocyte maturation via non-genomic mechanisms that are beginning to be understood. This paper will highlight some of the cellular markers resulting from the signaling initiated by 17alpha, 20beta-DP. By describing these markers, it is hoped that workers in the field will have additional tools to help further elucidate the signaling events of oocyte maturation.

Title:Intermittent spatio-temporal desynchronization and sequenced synchrony in ECoG signals.
Authors:['Kozma R', 'Freeman WJ']
Affiliation:Computational NeuroDynamics Laboratory, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38120, USA. rkozma@memphis.edu
Abstract:Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals from the brain surface typically exhibit high synchrony across large cortical areas, interrupted by brief periods of desynchronization exhibiting propagating phase discontinuities, across which spatial patterns of phase emerge in selected frequency bands. Experiments with rabbits trained using classical conditioning paradigms indicated that such desynchronization periods demarcate cognitive processing in the subjects; the ECoG in the frames between such periods revealed spatial patterns of amplitude modulation that were classified with respect to sensory stimuli that the rabbits had been trained to recognize. The present work describes intermittent synchrony and desynchronization of ECoG signals measured over the visual cortex. We analyze the analytic amplitude (AA) and analytic phase (AP) of the signals bandpassed over the beta band (12.5-25 Hz) and theta band (3-7 Hz) using the Hilbert transform. The AP of analytic signals evaluated using a Shannon-based synchronization index in theta band exhibits phase synchronization for varying time periods averaging about 1 s, interrupted by desynchronization periods of duration about 0.1 s. Synchronization periods in the beta-band last <100 ms, with interruptions by desynchronization lasting one-tenth that, in which the analytic amplitude drops drastically. During these "null spikes," the analytic phase is undefined, and the spatial and temporal phase differences show high dispersion. Detailed examination of the bandpass filtered ECoG confirms the presence of a shared mean frequency in a frame of synchronized oscillation, at which frequency the spatial pattern of the AP has the form of a cone. Between frames the AA approaches zero. The form of the null spike resembles a tornado (a vortex), as shown in sequential frames by a rotating spatial pattern of amplitude in the filtered ECoG.

Title:Multiple melatonin target tissues mediate termination of photorefractoriness by long day lengths in Siberian hamsters.
Authors:['Teubner BJ', 'Smith CD', 'Freeman DA']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-3540, USA.
Abstract:The development of refractoriness to the short-day melatonin rhythm in mid-winter triggers recrudescence of the photoinhibited reproductive system of many rodents. As a result, over-wintering animals attain reproductive competence prior to the onset of spring conditions that favor successful reproduction. While in the photorefractory state, hamsters are insensitive to short day lengths and the associated long-duration melatonin rhythm. Prior to regaining sensitivity to short day length inhibition of reproduction, hamsters must first be exposed to 10 to 12 weeks of long, summer-like day lengths and the associated short-duration melatonin rhythm. The neural melatonin target tissues that mediate the breaking of photorefractoriness by long day lengths have not been identified. Long day length information is thought to be communicated to the reproductive axis through the actions of melatonin at the reuniens nucleus of the thalamus (NRe) and the SCN of the hypothalamus. The authors report that the SCN and the NRe also participate in the breaking of reproductive photorefractoriness by long day lengths. Micro-implants of melatonin that were left in place for 12 weeks during exposure to long day lengths and that act locally on these brain nuclei to obscure the endogenous melatonin rhythm, and thus ambient day length information, blocked the breaking of refractoriness. Identical melatonin implants located in another melatonin target tissue, the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, did not interfere with the breaking of reproductive refractoriness. By contrast, breaking of refractoriness of the seasonal body mass response did not follow the pattern exhibited by the reproductive response. The results suggest that these melatonin target tissues serve distinct but overlapping roles in the photoperiodic mechanism.

Title:The effect of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor occupancy on the cytoskeleton of resting and activated platelets.

Abstract:The platelet integrin, glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa), serves as the receptor for fibrinogen. This study examined what effect GPIIb-IIIa receptor occupancy had on the cytoskeleton of resting and activated platelets. Triton X-100-insoluble residues (cytoskeletons) were isolated from resting washed platelets incubated with either 500 microM RGDS or 500 microM RGES and examined for protein content. RGDS did not increase the amount of GPIIb-IIIa associated with the cytoskeletal residues which sedimented at either 15,800 x g or 100,000 x g. To determine the effect of receptor occupancy on the formation of the activated platelet cytoskeleton, stirred and nonstirred RGDS-treated platelets in plasma were activated with ADP. Triton X-100-insoluble residues were isolated and examined for both protein content and retention of GPIIb-IIIa. Further, morphological studies were performed on the RGDS-ADP-stimulated platelets. The results of this study suggest that 1) RGDS peptide receptor occupancy does not lead to GPIIb-IIIa linkage to the cytoskeleton, 2) ADP-stimulated platelet shape change, polymerization of actin, and association of myosin with the cytoskeleton are unaffected by RGDS peptide receptor occupancy. 3) RGDS inhibits an aggregation-dependent incorporation of ABP, alpha-actinin, talin, and GPIIb-IIIa into the Triton-insoluble residue.

Abstract:The influence of degree of deacetylation (DDA), molecular weight (MW), and heat treatment on nanomechanical properties of three different chitosan coatings was assessed. Chitosans (2.5 wt % in 2% acetic acid) were solution cast and bonded to glass slides, subjected to 40, 70, or 90 degrees C heat treatments for 1 h, and then allowed to air dry. Non-heat treated films were used as controls. The nanomechanical and structural properties were evaluated using quasi-static nanoindentation, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Nanoindentation results showed that the coating with the lowest MW and highest DDA (95.6% DDA and MW = 2.43 x 10(6) Da) had higher reduced modulus of elasticity, (E = 4.02 +/- 0.85 GPa) as compared to the other chitosans; 76.1% DDA/MW = 3.20 x 10(6) Da, E = 3.66 +/- 0.68 GPa, and 92.3% DDA/MW = 7.52 x 10(6) Da, E = 3.56 +/- 0.25 GPa; (n = 75, p < 0.05). Crystallinity index, estimated via XRD, ranged from 36.4% +/- 1% to 49.7% +/- 6.5%. AFM revealed the presence of different crystalline morphologies such as needle-like crystals, sheet-like crystals, and small spherulites. The heat treatments applied during solution casting of the chitosan coatings did not affect morphology or nanomechanical properties. In conclusion, nanomechanical properties of chitosan coatings varied with DDA and MW and may be important to cell/tissue interactions.

Title:Autotaxin inhibition: challenges and progress toward novel anti-cancer agents.

Abstract:Autotaxin (ATX, autocrine motility factor, NPP2) has recently emerged as an attractive target for the development of anti-cancer chemotherapeutics. ATX contributes to the production of the bioactive lipid, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), from lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) in biological fluids including plasma, serum, and tumor cell effusates. LPA-stimulated cell proliferation, survival, motility and invasion have been demonstrated by numerous research groups. LPA receptors and ATX are upregulated in numerous cancer cell types and show expression patterns that correlate with tumor cell invasiveness. Despite considerable promise as an anti-cancer target, two complex challenges have slowed inhibitor discovery. The first of these challenges has been a lack of experimental details of the enzyme structure and its interactions with substrates or inhibitors. A second challenge has been a lack of structural diversity among initially reported inhibitors. Research reported in the last two years provides a foundation to begin addressing these challenges. Although an experimental structure of ATX is not among these recent developments, a crystal structure of the bacterial enzyme Xac. NPP is now available. This protein shares 35% identity with the central catalytic domain of ATX and provides an important starting point to begin understanding the structure of ATX. The structural diversity of known inhibitors has recently expanded to include not only phospholipid analogs, but also small molecules containing thiourea, diphenyldiazerenyl, anthracenedione and indole central cores. These two developments are essential tools for the discovery and optimization of ATX-targeted agents for evaluation as anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents.

Abstract:The purpose of this study was to examine if a pre-determined exposure level and duration of MP3 player music would result in significant changes in cochlear function when measured with audiometric and physiological methods. Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), synchronized spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SSOAEs), and hearing thresholds were measured in 20 normal-hearing adults before and after a 30-minute MP3 player music exposure. DPOAEs were acquired with 65/45 dB SPL primary tones (f(2)=0.842-7.996 kHz) with a frequency resolution of 8 points/octave. A probe microphone system recorded ear-canal music levels and was used to equalize levels at approximately 85 dBC across individuals during the music presentation. Comparison of pre- and post-exposure measurements revealed no significant differences in hearing thresholds, but DPOAE levels in half-octave bands centered from 1.4-6.0 kHz were significantly reduced following the music exposure. Post-exposure shifts in SSOAE frequency and level were highly variable in individuals identified with SSOAEs. The results for the exposure conditions explored in this study indicate that changes in otoacoustic emissions may precede the development of music-induced hearing threshold shifts.

Abstract:The recent confusion concerning the relation between hormone replacement therapy and cardiovascular disease has stirred a new wave of debate about the value and future of epidemiology. Opponents of epidemiology suggest an ever-diminishing role in an age of small risks and complex diseases, yet proponents are not in consensus about how to adapt their discipline to the challenges associated with ageing societies and changing disease patterns. While epidemiology is likely to be increasingly called upon to make sense of the risks involved with these changes, wading into this era with a mindset and tools that were derived from epidemiology's 'golden era' of tackling major risk factors, has created more confusion than understanding. Increasingly, we need to downsize epidemiology to what is testable, measurable, and relevant, based on robust methodology and public health rationale. Applying an evolutionary perspective, that views health problems of modernity as a manifestation of the mismatch between our ancient genes and hi-tech lifestyles, can provide guidance for a 21st century research agenda.

Abstract:Despite the continuing advances in treatment of open fractures and musculoskeletal wounds, infection remains a serious complication. Current treatments to prevent infection utilize surgical debridement and irrigation, and high doses of systemic antimicrobial therapy. The aim of this work was to evaluate, in vitro, the potential of a fast-resorbing calcium sulfate pellet loaded with an antibiotic. The pellet could be used as an adjunctive therapy at the time of debridement and irrigation to reduce bacterial wound contamination. Small pellets containing a binder and calcium sulfate were engineered to resorb rapidly (within 24 h) and deliver high local doses of antibiotic (amikacin, gentamicin, or vancomycin) to the wound site while minimizing systemic effects. Results from dissolution, elution, and biological activity tests against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were used to compare the performance of antibiotic-loaded, rapidly resorbing calcium sulfate pellets to antibiotic-loaded crushed conventional calcium sulfate pellets. Antibiotic-loaded rapidly resorbing pellets dissolved in vitro in deionized water in 12-16 h and released therapeutic antibiotic levels in phosphate buffered saline that were above the minimal inhibitory concentration for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, completely inhibiting the growth of these bacteria for the life of the pellet. Crushed conventional calcium sulfate pellets dissolved over 4-6 days, but the eluates only contained sufficient antibiotic to inhibit growth for the first 4 h. These data indicate that fast-resorbing pellets can release antibiotics rapidly and at therapeutic levels. Adjunctive therapy with fast-acting pellets is promising and warrants further in vivo studies.

Abstract:Triacetoxyvinylsilane (TAVS) has been used as a precursor to prepare sol-gel under aqueous conditions. The sol-gel product has been applied for the surface treatment of aluminum. Infrared and Raman spectra have been collected for TAVS and for TAVS sol-gel, xerogel and sol-gel-coated aluminum. Vibrational analyses have been suggested for the recorded spectra based essentially on the group frequencies and the spectral variation with the change of the sol-gel product states and the vibrational assignments of similar molecules. From the recorded infrared and Raman spectra of the sol-gel and xerogel, it is found that the sol-gel produced in the process with TAVS is essentially the same as that prepared from vinyltriethoxysilane. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of TAVS xerogel has been conducted, and an explanation has been given in coordination with the results obtained from IR spectroscopic study of the xerogels cured at different temperatures. The study has demonstrated the thermal effect on the condensation of the sol-gel process and on the vinyl decomposition of TAVS xerogel.

Title:Cyclic voltammograms at coplanar and shallow recessed microdisk electrode arrays: guidelines for design and experiment.
Authors:['Guo J', 'Lindner E']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Memphis, 330 Engineering Technology, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Although microdisk electrode arrays (MEAs) have been extensively used for more than three decades, the existing rules do not provide an unambiguous formula for the calculation of the minimum interelectrode distance (d) necessary for steady-state current response. With the aim of formulating generally applicable guidelines for design and experiment with MEAs, cyclic voltammograms were simulated for coplanar and shallow recessed microdisk electrode arrays with various interelectrode distances and dimensionless scan rates (V). The dimensionless scan rate (V) is a function of the radius (a) of the individual electrodes in the array, the diffusion coefficient (D) of the analyte, and the potential scan rate (v). The cyclic voltammograms at microdisk electrode arrays are grouped into five categories corresponding to the contributions of linear and radial diffusion to the overall responses. These categories are illustrated in a zone diagram based on the effect of V and d on the shape of cyclic voltammograms. The zone diagram reveals the minimum d and a cluster of linked d and V values that are incident to sigmoidal wave responses. For shallow recessed microdisk electrode arrays, the zones representing hemispherical diffusion are larger than that for coplanar arrays. The minimum d necessary for hemispherical diffusion becomes smaller as recess depth increases. With the zone diagram, one can predict the type of the cyclic voltammograms that can be expected for different microelectrode array geometries and experimental conditions. The fitting between simulation and experimental data validates our conclusions.

Abstract:3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) and its analogues 4-methyl-5-pyrazinyl-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (OLT) and 5-tert-butyl-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (TBD) are chemopreventive agents that block or diminish early stages of carcinogenesis by inducing activities of detoxication enzymes. While OLT has been used in clinical trials, TBD has been shown to be more efficacious and possibly less toxic than OLT in animals. Here, we utilize a robust and high-resolution chemical genomics procedure to examine the pharmacological structure-activity relationships of these compounds in livers of male rats by microarray analyses. We identified 226 differentially expressed genes that were common to all treatments. Functional analysis identified the relation of these genes to glutathione metabolism and the nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2-related factor 2 pathway (Nrf2) that is known to regulate many of the protective actions of dithiolethiones. OLT and TBD were shown to have similar efficacies and both were weaker than D3T. In addition, we identified 40 genes whose responses were common to OLT and TBD, yet distinct from D3T. As inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) has been associated with the effects of OLT on CYP expression, we determined the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values for inhibition of CYP1A2. The rank order of inhibitor potency was OLT >> TBD >> D3T, with IC(50) values estimated as 0.2, 12.8 and >100 microM, respectively. Functional analysis revealed that OLT and TBD, in addition to their effects on CYP, modulate liver lipid metabolism, especially fatty acids. Together, these findings provide new insight into the actions of clinically relevant and lead dithiolethione analogues.

Title:Acute exercise and oxidative stress: a 30 year history.
Authors:['Fisher-Wellman K', 'Bloomer RJ']

Abstract:The topic of exercise-induced oxidative stress has received considerable attention in recent years, with close to 300 original investigations published since the early work of Dillard and colleagues in 1978. Single bouts of aerobic and anaerobic exercise can induce an acute state of oxidative stress. This is indicated by an increased presence of oxidized molecules in a variety of tissues. Exercise mode, intensity, and duration, as well as the subject population tested, all can impact the extent of oxidation. Moreover, the use of antioxidant supplements can impact the findings. Although a single bout of exercise often leads to an acute oxidative stress, in accordance with the principle of hormesis, such an increase appears necessary to allow for an up-regulation in endogenous antioxidant defenses. This review presents a comprehensive summary of original investigations focused on exercise-induced oxidative stress. This should provide the reader with a well-documented account of the research done within this area of science over the past 30 years.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Dietary supplements targeting fat loss and increased thermogenesis are prevalent within the sport nutrition/weight loss market. While some isolated ingredients have been reported to be efficacious when used at high dosages, in particular in animal models and/or via intravenous delivery, little objective evidence is available pertaining to the efficacy of a finished product taken by human subjects in oral form. Moreover, many ingredients function as stimulants, leading to increased hemodynamic responses. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of a finished dietary supplement on plasma catecholamine concentration, markers of lipolysis, metabolic rate, and hemodynamics. METHODS: Ten resistance trained men (age = 27 +/- 4 yrs; BMI = 25 +/- 3 kg. m-2; body fat = 9 +/- 3%; mean +/- SD) ingested a dietary supplement (Meltdown(R), Vital Pharmaceuticals) or a placebo, in a random order, double blind cross-over design, with one week separating conditions. Fasting blood samples were collected before, and at 30, 60, and 90 minutes post ingestion and were assayed for epinephrine (EPI), norepinephrine (NE), glycerol, and free fatty acids (FFA). Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for all variables. Gas samples were collected from 30-60 minutes post ingestion for measurement of metabolic rate. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded at all blood collection times. RESULTS: AUC was greater for the dietary supplement compared to the placebo for NE (1332 +/- 128 pg.mL-1.90 min-1 vs. 1003 +/- 133 pg.mL-1.90 min-1; p = 0.03), glycerol (44 +/- 3 mug.mL-1.90 min-1 vs. 26 +/- 2 mug.mL-1.90 min-1; p < 0.0001), and FFA (1.24 +/- 0.17 mmol.L-1.90 min-1 vs. 0.88 +/- 0.12 mmol.L-1.90 min-1; p = 0.0003). No difference between conditions was noted for EPI AUC (p > 0.05). For all variables, values were highest at 90 minutes post ingestion. Total kilocalorie expenditure during the 30 minute collection period was 29.6% greater (p = 0.02) for the dietary supplement (35 +/- 3 kcal) compared to placebo (27 +/- 2 kcal). A condition main effect was noted for systolic blood pressure (p = 0.04), with values increasing from 117 +/- 2 mmHg to 123 +/- 2 mmHg with the dietary supplement, while remaining unchanged for placebo. No other hemodynamic changes were noted (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The dietary supplement results in an acute increase in plasma NE and markers of lipolysis, as well as metabolic rate. This occurs without altering hemodynamic variables in a clinically significant manner. Intervention studies to determine the impact of this dietary supplement on weight/fat loss are warranted.

Abstract:Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to a serious motor vehicle accident were randomly assigned to either group cognitive behavioral treatment(GCBT) or a minimum contact comparison group (MCC).Compared to the MCC participants (n=16), individuals who completed GCBT (n=17) showed significant reductions in PTSD symptoms, whether assessed using clinical interview or a self-report measure. Among treatment completers, 88.3% of GCBT participants did not satisfy criteria for PTSD at posttreatment assessment, relative to31.3% of the MCC participants. Examination of anxiety,depression, and pain measures did not show a unique advantage of GCBT. Treatment-related gains were maintained over a 3-month follow-up interval. Patients reported satisfaction with GCBT, and attrition from this treatment was comparable with individually administered CBTs.Results are discussed in light of modifications necessitated by the group treatment format, with suggestions for future study of this group intervention.

Title:Characterization of the performance of shoe insert materials.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Tan T', 'Shiue YS']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:It has been widely reported that shoe inserts are an effective interventional modality either for the relief of discomfort to the feet associated with a variety of orthopedic disorders or conditions or simply for comfort. Results from many types of experimental tests have been used to obtain the shock absorption capacity of shoe insert materials. The authors contend in this study that, while shock absorption is a highly desirable property, it is by no means the only that should be used to characterize these materials. Thus, a new index of performance of these materials is proposed. This index is computed from data, obtained in a simple experimental test, on both the shock absorption and energy return performances of the insert material.

Title:LAG-3 regulates plasmacytoid dendritic cell homeostasis.

Abstract:Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) is a CD4-related, activation-induced cell surface molecule expressed by various lymphoid cell types and binds to MHC class II with high affinity. We have previously shown that LAG-3 negatively regulates the expansion of activated T cells and T cell homeostasis, and is required for maximal regulatory T cell function. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that LAG-3 is also expressed on CD11c(low)/B220(+)/PDCA-1(+) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Lag3 expression, as determined by real time PCR, was approximately 10-fold greater in pDCs than in either regulatory T cells or activated T effector cells. Activated pDCs also generate approximately 5 times more sLAG-3 than activated T cells. LAG-3-deficient pDCs proliferate and expand more than wild-type pDCs in vivo in response to the TLR9 ligand, CpG. However, the effect of LAG-3 appears to be selective as there was no effect of LAG-3 on the expression of MHC class II, TLR9, and chemokine receptors, or on cytokine production. Lastly, adoptive transfer of either Lag3(+/+) or Lag3(-/-) T cells plus or minus Lag3(+/+) or Lag3(-/-) pDCs defined a role for LAG-3 in controlling pDC homeostasis as well as highlighting the consequences of deregulated Lag3(-/-) pDCs on T cell homeostasis. This raised the possibility of homeostatic reciprocity between T cells and pDCs. Collectively, our data suggests that LAG-3 plays an important but selective cell intrinsic and cell extrinsic role in pDC biology, and may serve as a key functional marker for their study.

Title:Computation of transient flow rates in passive pumping micro-fluidic systems.

Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. ijchen@memphis.edu
Abstract:Motion in micro-channels of passive flow micro-fluidic systems can be controlled by proper design and estimated by careful modeling. We report on methods to describe the flow rate as function of time in a passive pump driven micro-fluidic system. The model considers the surface energy present in small droplets, which prompts their shrinkage and induces flow. The droplet geometries are controlled by the micro-fluidic system geometry and hydrophilicity of the droplet channel contact area so that the chord of the droplet's cross section is restrained as the fluid is pumped. The model uses interfacial thermodynamics and the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for calculating the flow rate in micro-channels. Existing analyses consider the theoretical relationships among sample volume and induced flow rate, surface energy of the drops at the entrance and exit ports, and the resistance to flow. This model provides more specific information on the influence of the experimental conditions in computations of the flow rate. The model was validated in four sets of experiments. Passive pumps with 1.8 mm diameter, hydrophobic or hydrophilic entry ports, 5.0 or 10.0 mm channel length, and 2.5 or 3.3 mm diameter reservoir ports provided initial flow rates between 85 nL s(-1) and 196 nL s(-1).

Title:Infant mortality in southern states: a bureaucratic nightmare.
Authors:['Menifield CE', 'Dawson J']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Division of Public and Nonprofit Administration, USA.
Abstract:Despite numerous advances in technology, medicine, and health care, infant mortality continues to reach very high levels in southern states. The purpose of this paper is to examine demographic, economic, and health care factors that are likely to affect infant mortality. In so doing, we first compare infant mortality and other critical factors in southern states to other regions of the country. Second, we use cross tabulation tables to determine if there is a correlation between infant mortality and several independent variables. Third, we use regression analysis to determine how each of these variables affects the change in infant mortality for the 1990-2003 periods. The results of the cross tabulation tables indicate relationships between infant mortality and each of the independent variables. When these variables were placed in a regression model, high school graduation rates, race, geographic region, unemployment rates, uninsured rates, teenage pregnancy rates, single parent families, and the number of doctors and hospitals were significant.

Abstract:Post hoc assignment of patterns determined by all pairwise comparisons in microarray experiments with multiple treatments has been proven to be useful in assessing treatment effects. We propose the usage of transitive directed acyclic graphs (tDAG) as the representation of these patterns and show that such representation can be useful in clustering treatment effects, annotating existing clustering methods, and analyzing sample sizes. Advantages of this approach include: (1) unique and descriptive meaning of each cluster in terms of how genes respond to all pairs of treatments; (2) insensitivity of the observed patterns to the number of genes analyzed; and (3) a combinatorial perspective to address the sample size problem by observing the rate of contractible tDAG as the number of replicates increases. The advantages and overall utility of the method in elaborating drug structure activity relationships are exemplified in a controlled study with real and simulated data.

Abstract:Cigarette smoking continues to pose a significant health burden on society. Two well-described mechanistic links associating smoking with morbidity and mortality include elevated blood lipids and increased oxidative stress. These variables have traditionally been measured while an individual is fasting, but evidence suggests that postprandial lipemia and oxidative stress provide more important information concerning susceptibility to disease, in particular cardiovascular disease. Cigarette smokers have elevated levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress at rest and experience impaired postprandial lipid and glucose metabolism. We have confirmed these findings while noting an exaggerated oxidative stress response to high-fat feeding. Smoking cessation is without question the best approach to minimizing smoking-induced ill health and disease, but success rates among those who attempt to quit are dismal. Other means to decrease a smoker's susceptibility to oxidative stress-related disease are needed. We propose that exercise may aid in attenuating postprandial oxidative stress, and we do so in 3 distinct ways. First, exercise stimulates an increase in endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity. Second, exercise improves blood triglyceride clearance via a reduced chylomicron-triglyceride half-life and an enhanced lipoprotein lipase activity. Third, exercise improves blood glucose clearance via an enhanced glucose 4 transport protein translocation and protein content, as well as insulin-insulin receptor binding and postreceptor signaling. Improvements in antioxidant status, as well as lipid and glucose processing, may aid greatly in minimizing feeding-induced oxidative stress in smokers. If so, and in accordance with the recent joint initiative of the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Medical Association, exercise may be viewed as a "medicine" for cigarette smokers at increased risk for postprandial oxidative stress. Research into this area may provide insight into the potential benefits of exercise for this purpose.

Abstract:Dioxin is an extremely potent carcinogen. In highly exposed people, the most commonly observed toxicity is chloracne, a pathological response of the skin. Most of the effects of dioxin are attributed to its activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a transcription factor that binds to the Ah receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) to regulate the transcription of numerous genes, including CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. In cultures of normal human epidermal keratinocytes dioxin accelerates cell differentiation, as measured by the formation of cornified envelopes. We show that this acceleration is mediated by the AHR; also, that dioxin increases the expression of several genes known to be regulated by ARNT, which have critical roles in the cornification and epidermal barrier function of the skin. Importantly, we demonstrate that all of these responses are opposed by ligand-activation of the EGF receptor (R), an important regulator of keratinocyte cell fate. In the CYP1A1 enhancer, EGFR activation prevents recruitment of the p300 coactivator, although not affecting the binding of the AHR or ARNT. The total cellular level of p300 protein does not decrease, and overexpression of p300 relieves EGFR-mediated repression of transcription, indicating that p300 is a critical target for the repression of the AHR complex by EGFR signaling. These results provide a mechanism by which 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin is able to disrupt epidermal homeostasis and identify EGFR signaling as a regulator of the AHR. This signaling may modulate the incidence and severity of chloracne and be of therapeutic relevance to human poisonings by dioxin.

Title:Oxidative stress in response to aerobic and anaerobic power testing: influence of exercise training and carnitine supplementation.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ', 'Smith WA']

Abstract:The purpose of this study is to compare the oxidative stress response to aerobic and anaerobic power testing, and to determine the impact of exercise training with or without glycine propionyl-L-carnitine (GPLC) in attenuating the oxidative stress response. Thirty-two subjects were assigned (double blind) to placebo, GPLC-1 (1g PLC/d), GPLC-3 (3g PLC/d) for 8 weeks, plus aerobic exercise. Aerobic (graded exercise test: GXT) and anaerobic (Wingate cycle) power tests were performed before and following the intervention. Blood was taken before and immediately following exercise tests and analyzed for malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and xanthine oxidase activity (XO). No interaction effects were noted. MDA was minimally effected by exercise but lower at rest for both GPLC groups following the intervention (p = 0.044). A time main effect was noted for H2O2 (p = 0.05) and XO (p = 0.003), with values increasing from pre- to postexercise. Both aerobic and anaerobic power testing increase oxidative stress to a similar extent. Exercise training plus GPLC can decrease resting MDA, but it has little impact on exercise-induced oxidative stress biomarkers.

Title:Serum opacity factor is a streptococcal receptor for the extracellular matrix protein fibulin-1.

Affiliation:Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA. hcourtney@utmem.edu
Abstract:The adhesion of bacteria to host tissues is often mediated by interactions with extracellular matrices. Herein, we report on the interactions of the group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pyogenes, with the extracellular matrix protein fibulin-1. S. pyogenes bound purified fibulin-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of serum opacity factor (SOF), a virulence determinant of S. pyogenes, reduced binding by approximately 50%, and a recombinant peptide of SOF inhibited binding of fibulin-1 to streptococci by approximately 45%. Fibulin-1 bound to purified SOF2 in a dose-dependent manner with high affinity (K(d) = 1.6 nm). The fibulin-1-binding domain was localized to amino acid residues 457-806 of SOF2, whereas the fibronectin-binding domain is contained within residues 807-931 of SOF2, indicating that these two domains are separate and distinct. Fibulin-1 bound to recombinant SOF from M types 2, 4, 28, and 75 of S. pyogenes, indicating that the fibulin-1-binding domain is likely conserved among SOF from different serotypes. Mixed binding experiments suggested that gelatin, fibronectin, fibulin-1, and SOF form a quaternary molecular complex that enhanced the binding of fibulin-1. These data indicate that S. pyogenes can interact with fibulin-1 and that SOF is a major streptococcal receptor for fibulin-1 but not the only receptor. Such interactions with fibulin-1 may be involved in the adhesion of S. pyogenes to extracellular matrices of the host.

Title:Composite chitosan/nano-hydroxyapatite scaffolds induce osteocalcin production by osteoblasts in vitro and support bone formation in vivo.

Abstract:There is a significant clinical need to develop alternatives to autografts and allografts for bone grafting procedures. Porous, biodegradable scaffolds based on the biopolymer chitosan have been investigated as bone graft substitutes, and the addition of calcium phosphate to these scaffolds has been shown to improve the mechanical properties of the scaffold and may increase osteoconductivity. In this study, in vitro mineralization was examined for osteoblasts seeded in a porous scaffold composed of fused chitosan/nano-hydroxyapatite microspheres. Human fetal osteoblasts were cultured on composite and chitosan scaffolds for 21 days. On days 1, 4, 7, 14, and 21, total dsDNA, alkaline phosphatase, type I collagen, and osteocalcin production were measured. Total cellularity (measured by dsDNA), alkaline phosphatase, and type I collagen production were similar between the two scaffold groups. However, osteocalcin production occurred significantly earlier (day 7 vs. day 21) and was more than three times greater (0.0022 vs. 0.0068 ng/mL/ng DNA) on day 21 when osteoblasts were cultured on composite scaffolds. Osteocalcin is a marker of late osteoblastic differentiation and mineralized bone matrix formation. Therefore, the increase in osteocalcin production seen when cells were cultured on composite scaffolds may indicate that these scaffolds were superior to chitosan-only scaffolds in facilitating osteoblast mineralization. Composite scaffolds were also shown to be biocompatible and osteoconductive in a preliminary critical size rat calvarial defect study. These results demonstrate the potential of composite chitosan/nano-hydroxyapatite scaffolds to be used in bone tissue engineering.

Title:Developmental exposure to PCBs and/or MeHg: effects on a differential reinforcement of low rates (DRL) operant task before and after amphetamine drug challenge.

Abstract:The current study assessed the effects of developmental PCB and/or MeHg exposure on an operant task of timing and inhibitory control and determined if amphetamine (AMPH) drug challenges differentially affected performance. Long-Evans rats were exposed to corn oil (control), PCBs alone (1 or 3 mg/kg), MeHg alone (1.5 or 4.5 ppm), the low combination (1 mg/kg PCBs+1.5 ppm MeHg), or the high combination (3 mg/kg PCBs+4.5 ppm MeHg) throughout gestation and lactation. An environmentally relevant, formulated PCB mixture was used. Male and female offspring were trained to asymptotic performance on a differential reinforcement of low rates (DRL) operant task as adults. PCB-exposed groups had a lower ratio of reinforced to non-reinforced responses than controls. Groups exposed to MeHg alone were not impaired and the deficits observed in PCB-exposed groups were not seen when PCBs were co-administered with MeHg. AMPH was less disruptive to responding in males receiving PCBs alone, MeHg alone, and 1.0 mg/kg PCB+1.5 ppm MeHg. Paradoxically, the disruption in responding by AMPH in males given 3.0 mg/kg PCB+4.5 ppm MeHg did not differ from controls. Exposed females from all treatment groups did not differ from controls in their AMPH response. Overall, the findings suggest that developmental exposure to PCBs can decrease DRL performance. Co-exposure to MeHg seemed to mitigate the detrimental effects of PCBs on performance. The finding that the disruptive effects of AMPH on DRL performance were lessened in some groups of exposed males suggests that alterations in dopaminergic functioning may have a role in behavioral changes seen after perinatal PCB and MeHg exposure.

Title:Autotaxin structure-activity relationships revealed through lysophosphatidylcholine analogs.
Authors:['North EJ', 'Osborne DA', 'Bridson PK', 'Baker DL', 'Parrill AL']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry and Computational Research on Materials Institute, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Autotaxin (ATX) catalyzes the hydrolysis of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to form the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA stimulates cell proliferation, cell survival, and cell migration and is involved in obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, neuropathic pain, atherosclerosis and various cancers, suggesting that ATX inhibitors have broad therapeutic potential. Product feedback inhibition of ATX by LPA has stimulated structure-activity studies focused on LPA analogs. However, LPA displays mixed mode inhibition, indicating that it can bind to both the enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. This suggests that LPA may not interact solely with the catalytic site. In this report we have prepared LPC analogs to help map out substrate structure-activity relationships. The structural variances include length and unsaturation of the fatty tail, choline and polar linker presence, acyl versus ether linkage of the hydrocarbon chain, and methylene and nitrogen replacement of the choline oxygen. All LPC analogs were assayed in competition with the synthetic substrate, FS-3, to show the preference ATX has for each alteration. Choline presence and methylene replacement of the choline oxygen were detrimental to ATX recognition. These findings provide insights into the structure of the enzyme in the vicinity of the catalytic site as well as suggesting that ATX produces rate enhancement, at least in part, by substrate destabilization.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among body mass index (BMI), self-perceptions, and body image discrepancy in African American (AA) girls. METHODS: Baseline self-perception and BMI data were collected by trained staff from 303 preadolescent AA girls participating in the girls health enrichment multi-site studies. Correlations and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify relationships of BMI with self-perception factors. RESULTS: Girls with a BMI at or above the 85th percentile were more likely to have greater body image discrepancy and participate in weight control behaviors than girls with a BMI below the 85th percentile. Body image discrepancy was not related to self-esteem, but was positively correlated with physical activity self-concept and self-efficacy, and diet self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: Girls with higher BMI had greater body image discrepancy and were less confident in abilities to be active and eat healthy. Findings may inform the development of obesity interventions for preadolescents.

Abstract:Human cognition performs granulation of the seemingly homogeneous temporal sequences of perceptual experiences into meaningful and comprehensible chunks of fuzzy concepts and behaviors. These knowledge granules are stored and consequently accessed during action selection and decisions. A dynamical approach is presented here to interpret experimental findings using K (Katchalsky) models. In the K model, meaningful knowledge is repetitiously created and processed in the form of sequences of oscillatory patterns of neural activity distributed across space and time. These patterns are not rigid but flexible and intermittent; soon after they arise through phase transitions, they dissipate. Computational implementations demonstrate the operation of the model based on the principles of intentional brain dynamics.

Abstract:Hesitations have been considered to serve both cognitive and linguistic functions. This study presents analyses of children's hesitations while producing English derived words with the suffix -ity. Two questions were considered: Do children's linguistic skills influence their use and frequency of hesitations when producing derived words, and do children's use of hesitations vary as a function of word frequency. Eight real words derived with the suffix -ity were produced by 20 third grade children and analysed for different hesitation types. Four of the target words were high in lexical frequency, and four were low in lexical frequency. Results indicated varying hesitation patterns based upon stress accuracy skill. Children with good stress accuracy skills tended to produce false starts, whereas children with poor stress accuracy skills tended to produce glottal stops and intra-word pauses. Word frequency had a specific effect only for children with good stress accuracy skills.

Title:Speech understanding using surgical masks: a problem in health care?
Authors:['Mendel LL', 'Gardino JA', 'Atcherson SR']
Affiliation:School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, University of Memphis, 807 Jefferson Avenue, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. Imendel@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Successful communication is necessary in health-care environments. Yet the presence of noise in hospitals, operating rooms, and dental offices may have a deleterious effect on health-care personnel and patients understanding messages accurately. The presence of a surgical mask and hearing loss may further affect speech perception. PURPOSE: To evaluate whether a surgical mask had an effect on speech understanding for listeners with normal hearing and hearing impairment when speech stimuli were administered in the presence or absence of dental office noise. RESEARCH DESIGN: Participants were assigned to one of two groups based on hearing sensitivity in this quasi-experimental, cross-sectional study. STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 31 adults participated in this study (1 talker, 15 listeners with normal hearing, and 15 with hearing impairment). The normal hearing group had thresholds of 25 dB HL or better at the octave frequencies from 250 through 8000 Hz while the hearing loss group had varying degrees and configurations of hearing loss with thresholds equal to or poorer than 25 dB HL for the same octave frequencies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Selected lists from the Connected Speech Test (CST) were digitally recorded with and without a surgical mask present and then presented to the listeners in four conditions: without a mask in quiet, without a mask in noise, with a mask in quiet, and with a mask in noise. RESULTS: A significant difference was found in the spectral analyses of the speech stimuli with and without the mask. The presence of a surgical mask, however, did not have a detrimental effect on speech understanding in either the normal-hearing or hearing-impaired groups. The dental office noise did have a significant effect on speech understanding for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the presence of a surgical mask did not negatively affect speech understanding. However, the presence of noise did have a deleterious effect on speech perception and warrants further attention in health-care environments.

Abstract:INTRODUCTION: Waterpipe tobacco smoking is increasing in popularity though the toxicant exposure and effects associated with this tobacco use method are not well understood. METHODS: Sixty-one waterpipe tobacco smokers (56 males; mean age +/- SD, 30.9 +/- 9.5 years; mean number of weekly waterpipe smoking episodes, 7.8 +/- 5.7; mean duration of waterpipe smoking 8.5 +/- 6.1 years) abstained from smoking for at least 24 hr and then smoked tobacco from a waterpipe ad libitum in a laboratory. Before and after smoking, expired-air carbon monoxide (CO) and subjective effects were assessed; puff topography was measured during smoking. RESULTS: The mean waterpipe use episode duration was 33.1 +/- 13.1 min. Expired-air CO increased significantly from a mean of 4.0 +/- 1.7 before to 35.5 +/- 32.7 after smoking. On average, participants took 169 +/- 100 puffs, with a mean puff volume of 511 +/- 333 ml. Urge to smoke, restlessness, craving, and other tobacco abstinence symptoms were reduced significantly after smoking, while ratings of dizzy, lightheaded, and other direct effects of nicotine increased. DISCUSSION: Expired-air CO and puff topography data indicate that, relative to a single cigarette, a single waterpipe tobacco smoking episode is associated with greater smoke exposure. Abstinent waterpipe tobacco smokers report symptoms similar to those reported by abstinent cigarette smokers, and these symptoms are reduced by subsequent waterpipe tobacco smoking. Taken together, these data are consistent with the notion that waterpipe tobacco smoking is likely associated with the risk of tobacco/nicotine dependence.

Title:The association of birth weight with arterial stiffness at mid-adulthood: the Bogalusa Heart Study.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Birth weight has been found to predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Pulse wave velocity (PWV), a marker of arterial stiffness, has been associated with cardiovascular risk factors. An association between birth weight and blood pressure (BP) has previously been reported. In this study, the association of birth weight with PWV, and the relationship between birth weight, pulse wave velocity and BP in mid-adulthood were investigated. METHODS: The Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS) is a population-based longitudinal study to investigate the natural development of cardiovascular risk factors. In the 2001 survey, brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV) was measured as an indicator of arterial stiffness. Of the 1203 participants in that survey, 707 had complete data on birth weight and PWV, which were utilised for this study. RESULTS: In this study, birth weight was inversely correlated with baPWV, pulse pressure, and systolic and diastolic BP (r = -0.10; r = -0.10; r = -0.13 and r = -0.09, respectively; p< or =0.01 for all). After adjustment, birth weight was inversely associated with baPWV. On average, baPWV decreased by 0.23 m/s (95% CI -0.44 to -0.03 m/s) for each 1 kg increase in birth weight. Birth weight (inversely) and baPWV were independently associated with systolic BP (B = -2.05; 95% CI -3.27 to -0.84 and B = 2.99; 95% CI 2.58 to 3.40 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Lower birth weight is associated with higher baPWV. The link between birth weight and systolic BP may be partially explained by the association of birth weight with PWV.

Abstract:Cigarette smokers experience an exaggerated triglyceride (TAG) and oxidative stress response to high fat feeding. Exercise training may serve to attenuate the rise in these variables, by improving TAG clearance and antioxidant defense. We compared blood TAG, antioxidant capacity, and oxidative stress biomarkers in exercise trained (>2 hrs per wk) and untrained smokers matched for age, in response to a high fat test meal. We report here that low volume exercise training can attenuate postprandial lipid peroxidation, but has little impact on blood TAG and other markers of oxidative stress. Higher volumes of exercise may be needed to allow for clinically meaningful adaptations in postprandial lipemia and oxidative stress.

Title:Lyophilization to improve drug delivery for chitosan-calcium phosphate bone scaffold construct: a preliminary investigation.
Authors:['Reves BT', 'Bumgardner JD', 'Cole JA', 'Yang Y', 'Haggard WO']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. breves1@gmail.com
Abstract:Lyophilization was evaluated in chitosan-calcium phosphate microspheres and scaffolds to improve drug delivery of growth factors and antibiotics for orthopedic applications. The dual delivery of an antibiotic and a growth factor from a composite scaffold would be beneficial for treatment of complex fracture sites, such as comminuted fractures and segmental bone defects. The aim of this investigation was to increase the loading capacity of the composite by taking advantage of the increased porosity, due to lyophilization, and to produce an extended elution profile using a secondary chitosan-bead coating. The physiochemical properties of the composite were investigated, and loading and elution studies were performed with alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), and amikacin. Lyophilization was found to increase the surface area of scaffolds by over 400% and the porosity of scaffolds by 50%. Using ALP as a model protein, the loading capacity was increased by lyophilization from 4.3 +/- 2.5 to 24.6 +/- 3.6 microg ALP/mg microspheres, and the elution profile was extended by a supplemental chitosan coating. The loading capacity of BMP-2 for composite microspheres was increased from 74.4 +/- 3.7 to 102.1 +/- 8.0 microg BMP-2/g microspheres with lyophilization compared with nonlyophilized microspheres. The elution profiles of BMP-2 and the antibiotic amikacin were not extended with the supplemental coating. Additional investigations are planned to improve these elution characteristics for growth factors and antibiotics.

Title:Reverse current pulse method to restore uniform concentration profiles in ion-selective membranes. 2. Comparison of the efficiency of the different protocols.
Authors:['Zook JM', 'Lindner E']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Memphis, 330 Engineering Technology Building, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:The membrane potential of ion-selective electrodes is measured at zero current in traditional potentiometric analysis. Recently, pulsed potentiometric methods have gained importance. In pulsed potentiometric methods, the voltage measured at the end of a current pulse is usually the analytical signal. The applied current alters the concentration profiles inside the sensing membrane. For reproducible voltage measurements the original concentration profiles must be restored in the membrane between current pulses. The simplest restoration method is the zero-current relaxation. Unfortunately, the zero-current method is very slow, which limits the frequency of measurements. In analytical practice the controlled voltage restoration method is most commonly used, but the controlled voltage method has no adequate theoretical description. This paper presents a finite element model of the controlled voltage method to predict its efficiency. The model demonstrates for the first time that increasing membrane resistance decreases the efficiency of this restoration method. The model allows estimating the necessary restoration time for voltage errors below an acceptable threshold value and provides guidance for minimizing the voltage error. The efficiency of the controlled voltage method is compared to the reverse current pulse restoration method discussed in part 1 of this set of papers. It is found that the reverse current restoration method is simpler, requires shorter restoration times (i.e., it allows higher measurement frequency), and it has 4 and 10 times smaller voltage errors compared to the controlled voltage method. These theoretical results are confirmed experimentally. The only limitation of the reverse current pulse restoration method is that it cannot be used with membranes containing a background electrolyte (R(+)R(-)) but no excess lipophilic cation exchanger (R(-)). However, lipophilic cation exchanger can often be added to the membrane to reduce restoration times by allowing the reverse current pulse method to be used.

Title:Reverse current pulse method to restore uniform concentration profiles in ion-selective membranes. 1. Galvanostatic pulse methods with decreased cycle time.
Authors:['Zook JM', 'Lindner E']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, The University of Memphis, 330 Engineering Technology Building, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:The applications of ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) have been broadened through the introduction of galvanostatic current pulse methods in potentiometric analysis. An important requirement in these applications is the restoration of the uniform equilibrium concentration profiles in the ISE membrane between each measurement. The simplest restoration method is zero-current relaxation, in which the membrane relaxes under open-circuit conditions in a diffusion-controlled process. This paper presents a novel restoration method using a reverse current pulse. An analytic model for this restoration method is derived to predict the concentration profiles inside ISE membranes following galvanostatic current pulses. This model allows the calculation of the voltage transients as the membrane voltage relaxes back toward its zero-current equilibrium value. The predicted concentration profiles and voltage transients are confirmed using spectroelectrochemical microscopy (SpECM). The reverse current restoration method described in this paper reduces the voltage drift and voltage error by 10-100 times compared to the zero-current restoration method. Therefore, this new method provides faster and more reproducible voltage measurements in most chronopotentiometric ISE applications, such as improving the detection limit and determining concentrations and diffusion coefficients of membrane species. One limitation of the reverse current restoration method is that it cannot be used in a few applications that require background electrolyte loaded membranes without excess of lipophilic cation exchanger.

Abstract:Bis(trimethoxysilyl)ethane (BTMSE) and (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPTMS) have been used as precursors to prepare sol-gels and hybrid sol-gel under acidic condition. From the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data on MPTMS sol-gel coated aluminum and copper, it has been shown that the silane film is covalently bonded to Al surface through the interfacial condensation. There is no evidence of bonding interaction between the thiol group and the Cu. The recorded reflection adsorption IR (RAIR) spectrum has provided evidence that the coating BTMSE film covalently interacts with Al. Vibrational assignments have been suggested for pure BTMSE, BTMSE sol-gel, BTMSE xerogel, and BTMSE coated Al panel based on the group frequencies and the variation of frequencies with the sample treatment conditions. The progression of condensation reaction has been observed from the IR spectra of the BTMSE sol-gel and the sol-gel coated film after the treatments at different temperatures with different lengths of time. The corrosion protection of the sol-gel coated Al and Cu has been characterized in NaCl solutions by cyclic voltammetric, potentiodynamic polarization and impedance spectroscopy methods. All these electrochemical measurements indicate that the sol-gel coated metals have better corrosion protection than the corresponding uncoated metals.

Abstract:Quantification of alpha- and gamma-endorphins in rat brain using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry is described. [D-Ala(2)]-gamma-endorphin is used as an internal standard. The precursor-to-product ion MRM transitions for alpha-endorphin, gamma-endorphin, and [D-Ala(2)]-gamma-endorphin were m/z 873.6-->429.6; 929.6-->542.3; 936.6-->542.3, respectively. The method was validated in terms of linearity, specificity, sensitivity, recovery, precision, and accuracy. The assay was linear over a concentration range of 0.1-200 ng/mL with the limit-of-detection of 0.03 ng/mL and limit-of-quantification of 0.1 ng/mL. The endogenous concentrations of alpha- and gamma-endorphins in rat brains were 13.8+/-0.57 (mean+/-SD; n=5) and 2.5+/-0.43 ng/g of wet tissue weight, respectively.

Title:Influence of powder-to-liquid monomer ratio on properties of an injectable iodine-containing acrylic bone cement for vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty.

Abstract:The interventional radiological techniques of vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) are widely used in cases where the pain secondary to compression fractures of vertebral bodies is severe, persistent, and refractory to conservative treatments. In the majority of VP and BKP cases, an injectable poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement and different values of powder-to-liquid monomer ratio (PLMR) are used. A systematic study of the influence of PLMR on relevant cement properties is lacking. This was the subject of the present study, with the injectable PMMA bone cement used being an experimental one whose radiopacity is provided by an iodine-containing compound in the powder. The PLMRs used-1.54, 2.22, and 3.08 g mL(-1)-are within the range used in clinical reports on VP and BKP. One property of the curing cement, namely, the polymerization rate at 37 degrees C (k'), was estimated using nonisothermal differential scanning calorimetry results. The fatigue lives (N(f)) of cured cement specimens were obtained under axial loading corresponding to axial stresses (S) of +/-20.0, 15.0, 12.5, and 10.0 MPa, at a frequency of 2 Hz. The fatigue limit of the cement was estimated from the fit of the S - N(f) results to the Olgive equation. With increase in PLMR, k' increased significantly, but the influence of PLMR on the fatigue limit and on another property also estimated from the S - ln N(f) results is not significant.

Title:Effect of oral acetyl L-carnitine arginate on resting and postprandial blood biomarkers in pre-diabetics.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Resting and postprandial oxidative stress is elevated in those with metabolic disorders such as diabetes. Antioxidant supplementation may attenuate the rise in oxidative stress following feeding. Therefore we sought to determine the effects of acetyl L-carnitine arginate (ALCA) on resting and postprandial biomarkers of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as oxidative stress. METHODS: Twenty-nine pre-diabetic men and women were randomly assigned to either 3 g.day(-)(1) of ALCA (n = 14; 31 +/- 3 yrs) or placebo (n = 15; 35 +/- 3 yrs) in a double-blind design, to consume for eight weeks. Fasting blood samples were taken from subjects both pre and post intervention. After each fasting sample was obtained, subjects consumed a high fat, high carbohydrate meal and additional blood samples were taken at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post meal. Samples were analyzed for a variety of metabolic variables (e.g., glucose, HbA1c, lipid panel, C-reactive protein, nitrate/nitrite, and several markers of oxidative stress). Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each variable measured post meal, both pre and post intervention. RESULTS: ALCA, but not placebo, resulted in an increase in nitrate/nitrite (25.4 +/- 1.9 to 30.1 +/- 2.8 mumol.L(-)(1)) from pre to post intervention, with post intervention values greater compared to placebo (p = 0.01). No other changes of statistical significance were noted (p > 0.05), although ALCA resulted in slight improvements in glucose (109 +/- 5 to 103 +/- 5 mg.dL(-)(1)), HbA1c (6.6 +/- 1.1 to 6.2 +/- 1.2%), and HOMA-IR (3.3 +/- 1.3 to 2.9 +/- 1.2). AUC postprandial data were not statistically different between ALCA and placebo for any variable (p > 0.05). However, nitrate/nitrite demonstrated a moderate effect size (r = 0.35) for increase from pre (139.50 +/- 18.35 mumol.L(-)(1).6 hr(-)(1)) to post (172.40 +/- 21.75 mumol.L(-)(1).6 hr(-)(1)) intervention with ALCA, and the magnitude of decrease following feeding was not as pronounced as with placebo. CONCLUSION: Supplementation with ALCA results in an increase in resting nitrate/nitrite in pre-diabetics, without any statistically significant change in other metabolic or oxidative stress variables measured at rest or post meal.

Title:Cyclic nucleotide crosstalk in salivary glands from partially fed Dermacentor variabilis (Say).

Abstract:Enzyme immunosorbent assays were used to measure cyclic nucleotide concentrations in homogenates of salivary glands from partially fed female Dermacentor variabilis. The adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (100 microM) increased homogenate cGMP concentrations greater than three-fold over controls. Competitive inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with 1mM l-NMMA, an l-arginine analog, demonstrated that crosstalk occurs downstream of nitric oxide synthesis. Forskolin-stimulated synthesis of cGMP was diminished 58% by the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ (2 microM). The protein kinase A selective inhibitor Rp-cAMPS (50 microM) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cGMP by 49%. Whole glands treated with 10 microM dopamine increased cGMP levels two-fold in the presence of 1mM IBMX. Treatment of whole salivary glands with equimolar concentrations of 8-Br-cAMP and 8-Br-cGMP produced no greater fluid uptake than in glands treated with 8-Br-cGMP alone, suggesting that cAMP and cGMP share a downstream target. The protein kinase G-selective inhibitor Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS (100 microM) impeded 10mM 8-Bromo-cGMP-stimulated gland weight increases. Pretreatment with verapamil, a Ca(2+) channel blocker, attenuated cyclic nucleotide-stimulated fluid uptake indicating that whole gland fluid changes are dependent on extracellular Ca(2+). Together, our data suggest that cGMP production is mediated in part by cAMP-dependent activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase. Experiments measuring changes in whole salivary gland weight support the hypothesis that cAMP and cGMP signaling cascades have a common target and that cyclic nucleotide-stimulated fluid movement is dependent on Ca(2+) influx.

Title:The peptides APLHK, EHIPA and GAPL are hydropathically equivalent peptide mimics of a fibrinogen binding domain of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa.
Authors:['Gartner TK', 'Loudon R', 'Taylor DB']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:The anticomplementarity hypothesis predicted that the peptides APLHK, EHIPA, GAPL and LGVPPR would be functional mimics of a fibrinogen binding domain(s) in the fibrinogen receptor. The peptides APLHK and EHIPA were derived by translation of the cRNA of vitronectin m-RNA. The peptides GAPL and LGVPPR result from translations of the cRNA of von Willebrand factor m-RNA. The peptides APLHK, EHIPA, and GAPL, but not LGVPPRT, are hydropathically equivalent and inhibit fibrinogen binding to platelets. APLHK and EHIPA are hydropathic retromers. Thus for one pair of these peptides, the direction of their backbones did not affect function.

Abstract:PURPOSE Disease dissemination to the bone marrow is detected at diagnosis in approximately 15% of children with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LL). It is unclear whether the remaining patients have submicroscopic systemic disease and, if so, what is the clinical significance of this finding. PATIENTS AND METHODS Using a flow cytometric method that can detect one T-LL cell among 10,000 normal cells, we examined bone marrow and peripheral-blood samples collected from 99 children with T-LL at diagnosis, as well as blood samples collected from 42 patients during treatment. Results In 71 (71.7%) of the 99 marrow samples obtained at diagnosis, T-LL cells represented 0.01% to 31.6% (median, 0.22%) of mononuclear cells; 57 of the 71 T-LL-positive samples were from patients with stage II/III disease. Results of studies in bilateral marrow aspirates were highly concordant. Two-year event-free survival (EFS) was 68.1% +/- 11.1% (SE) for patients with > or = 1% T-LL cells in bone marrow versus 90.7% +/- 4.4% for those with lower levels of marrow involvement (P = .031); EFS for patients with > or = 5% lymphoblasts was 51.9% +/- 18.0% (P = .009). T-LL cells were as prevalent in blood as in marrow; monitoring residual T-LL cells in blood during remission induction therapy identified patients with slower disease clearance. CONCLUSION More than two thirds of children with T-LL have disseminated disease at diagnosis, a proportion much higher than previously demonstrated. Measurements of disease dissemination at diagnosis might provide useful prognostic information, which can be further refined by monitoring response to therapy through blood testing.

Title:Isolation of lysozyme and an antifungal peptide from sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) plasma.
Authors:['Rose WM', 'Ourth DD']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-3560, USA.
Abstract:The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) belongs to the most primitive class of fish and has only innate immunity. The innate immune factors, lysozyme and an antifungal peptide, were isolated from sea lamprey plasma. Sea lamprey plasma (40.1mg protein/ml) was assayed for lysozyme activity by gel diffusion assay. Using hen egg white lysozyme standards, plasma concentration of lamprey lysozyme was 5microg lysozyme/mg total protein. The presence of lysozyme in such high concentration in lamprey plasma could be important in their innate immunity and resistance to infection. Lysozyme and the antifungal peptide were isolated by low molecular weight gel filtration chromatography from sea lamprey plasma. Gel filtration chromatography yielded two peak tubes containing lysozyme (1microg/211microg total protein) and antifungal peptide (1microg/66microg total protein). Lysozyme and antifungal activity of each fraction were determined by well diffusion assay using Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and two fungal species. The molecular weight of lamprey lysozyme was 14.3kDa. The sea lamprey lysozyme was effective against Gram-positive bacteria but not against Gram-negative bacteria or fungi. Molecular weight of the antifungal peptide was approximately 3000Da. Antifungal plasma activity was seen against Penicillium notatum and Aspergillus flavus. No plasma antibacterial peptide was found.

Abstract:Previous investigations have demonstrated leg strength deficits in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) as compared to neurologically-normal adults. However, the exact mode of contraction by which strength is assessed may determine how closely such deficits are related to functional performance. The purpose of this study was to better understand the relationship of strength and functional mobility in persons with PD (n = 17, mean H&Y stage = 2.0) via comparison to a group of similar age healthy controls (n = 10) using a multi-joint isometric test of strength and various measures of functional mobility. Tests included isometric leg press maximum force relative to body mass, the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC), postural sway under various unilateral stance and visual conditions, and the timed up and go (TUG). Relative force (p = 0.044) and ABC questionnaire mean scores (p < 0.001), showed controls performing better than PD subjects. The control group performed better than the PD group for length of path of the center of pressure except in the eyes closed positions (p < 0.05 for all). TUG time (p = 0.052) was not significantly different between the PD group and healthy controls. Leg press maximum force relative to body mass was however significantly correlated with TUG time (r = -0.68, p = 0.003) in persons with PD. There were no gender differences for any variables. These results suggest that some balance and functional mobility task performances are more worse for persons with mild-to-moderate PD than for neurologically-normal age-matched controls, which may be influenced by lessened lower extremity multi-joint strength. Strength training of the lower extremity utilizing such multi-joint actions may be beneficial for this population.

Title:Comparison of objective and subjective measures of speech intelligibility in elderly hearing-impaired listeners.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC', 'Rivera IM']
Affiliation:Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, Memphis State University, TN.
Abstract:Three experiments were performed to evaluate the use of subjective intelligibility estimations as a method for measuring hearing aid benefit. Subjective and objective speech intelligibility scores were compared for young normal-hearing and elderly hearing-impaired listeners. Objective intelligibility scores were obtained using the Connected Speech Test (CST). This test consists of conversationally produced passages of speech that the listener repeats sentence by sentence. To provide subjective intelligibility scores, listeners estimated the percentage that they understood of each CST passage. Comparison of the two types of scores revealed that they were closely related in both groups of subjects (r = .82-.92). Although the two types of scores were essentially equal for normal-hearing subjects, the hearing-impaired listeners tended to produce subjective estimations of intelligibility that were significantly lower than their objective scores. Manipulation of visual cues and amplification, in an attempt to influence the hearing-impaired listeners' expectation of understanding speech, had no effect on the subjective-objective score differential. The difference between subjective and objective scores in the hearing-impaired group was not related to audiometric variables such as speech reception threshold, audiogram, or duration of hearing loss. It was concluded that comparative hearing aid evaluations using subjective intelligibility estimates would usually produce the same relative outcome as evaluations using the objective intelligibility measurement procedure. However, scores obtained with the objective procedure had smaller critical differences. Thus, when both types of scores are based on the same number of passages, the objective measurement procedure would be the more sensitive to differences among hearing aids.

Title:Effects of unstable surface training on measures of balance in older adults.

Affiliation:Exercise Neuromechanics Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. bschllng@memphis.edu.
Abstract:The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of a 5-week, low-cost unstable surface balance training program in sexagenarians. Nineteen men and women (60-68 years; 83.7 +/- SD kg) were randomly assigned to a control or training group. The training group performed various balance activities on air-filled rubber disks for 5 weeks. Each thrice-weekly session was supervised, and progression was based on proficiency. While in an upright position, static balance (length of path [LOP] of the center of pressure) was assessed in both eyes-open and eyes-closed states for each leg separately as well as for both legs. Participants also performed the timed up-and-go (TUG) test and completed the Activity-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) questionnaire. A significant group x time effect for the ABC questionnaire was found (p = 0.04). Tukey post hoc analysis indicates that the balance training program increased self-perceived balance confidence (p < 0.01). No significant group x time interactions were noted for TUG or LOP. Because no objective measure of balance or function was changed, the increase in ABC may be spurious. Unstable surface training may not be effective in improving balance among persons for whom balance is not problematic. However, the large number of acute training variables in such a program leaves opportunity for further research in this paradigm.

Title:The components of paraphrase evaluations.
Authors:['McCarthy PM', 'Guess RH', 'McNamara DS']
Affiliation:FedEx Institute of Technology, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. pmmccrth@memphis.edu
Abstract:Two sentences are paraphrases if their meanings are equivalent but their words and syntax are different. Paraphrasing can be used to aid comprehension, stimulate prior knowledge, and assist in writing-skills development. As such, paraphrasing is a feature of fields as diverse as discourse psychology, composition, and computer science. Although automated paraphrase assessment is both commonplace and useful, research has centered solely on artificial, edited paraphrases and has used only binary dimensions (i.e., is or is not a paraphrase). In this study, we use an extensive database (N=1,998) of natural paraphrases generated by high school students that have been assessed along 10 dimensions (e.g., semantic completeness, lexical similarity, syntactical similarity). This study investigates the components of paraphrase quality emerging from these dimensions and examines whether computational approaches can simulate those human evaluations. The results suggest that semantic and syntactic evaluations are the primary components of paraphrase quality, and that computationally light systems such as latent semantic analysis (semantics) and minimal edit distances (syntax) present promising approaches to simulating human evaluations of paraphrases.

Abstract:Nestlings of altricial species undergo a period of substantial growth and development in the nest after hatching. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulates the release of stress hormones such as corticosterone, which in adults is critical in allowing an animal to respond to a stressor. However, activation of this axis in young birds may be detrimental to growth and possibly survival. The developmental hypothesis predicts that altricial nestlings should display a dampened corticosterone response to stress as a means of protection against the potentially harmful effects of elevated corticosterone. We examined this hypothesis in Florida scrub-jays, a cooperatively breeding species with altricial young. Blood samples were collected from nestlings, nutritionally independent young, and yearlings for measurement of corticosterone levels. Baseline corticosterone levels did not differ between age-classes; however, stress-induced corticosterone levels were highest in yearlings, intermediate in independent young, and lowest in nestlings. The nestling stress response was also of a shorter duration than the response in independent young and yearlings. This variation in stress responsiveness across ages may be an adaptive mechanism to protect the developing bird from the negative effects of corticosterone on growth and cognitive development.

Abstract:Nine experimental wetlands were built to determine chromium partitioning inside systems treating tannery wastewaters. Results showed 5-day biochemical oxygen demand and chromium removals of 95 to 99% and 90 to 99%, respectively. The majority of chromium was found in association with media (96 to 98%), followed by effluents (2.9 to 3.9%), and the least was found in plant parts (0.1%). Chemical speciation modeling of solutions and scanning electron microscope analysis suggest two potential chromium removal mechanisms--sorption/coprecipitation with iron hydroxides or oxyhydroxides and biomass sorption. The release of the majority of chromium in the iron- and organic-bound phases during sequential extractions supports the proposed dominant removal mechanisms. The use of a mixture of peat and gravel resulted in lower removal efficiencies and stronger partitioning in organic phases during sequential extractions. Chromium was efficiently removed by wetlands, retained through chemical and biological processes. Future research will focus on further exploring removal mechanisms and proposing management strategies for the chromium-containing wetland media.

Abstract:The prevalence of obesity and its associated disorders [e.g., insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD)] has seen a rapid increase in recent years. As such, understanding the mechanisms underlying diet-induced insulin resistance has been a topic of interest. In line with this notion, postprandial oxidative stress has received considerable attention over the past several years due to its involvement in the etiology of the above mentioned conditions. In fact, postprandial oxidative stress has been suggested to be the unifying mechanism in the connection between insulin resistance, Type 2 diabetes and CVD. In addition to this growing association, recent data are now available suggesting a causal role for such prooxidant stress in the development of insulin resistance. This review is intended to provide an overview of literature pertaining to the role of free radical production following feeding, as related to the development of insulin resistance, Type 2 diabetes and CVD.

Abstract:Defective responses to DNA single strand breaks underlie various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact role of this repair pathway during the development and maintenance of the nervous system is unclear. Using murine neural-specific inactivation of Xrcc1, a factor that is critical for the repair of DNA single strand breaks, we found a profound neuropathology that is characterized by the loss of cerebellar interneurons. This cell loss was linked to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and occurred as interneuron progenitors commenced differentiation. Loss of Xrcc1 also led to the persistence of DNA strand breaks throughout the nervous system and abnormal hippocampal function. Collectively, these data detail the in vivo link between DNA single strand break repair and neurogenesis and highlight the diverse consequences of specific types of genotoxic stress in the nervous system.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To examine swimming ability and variables associated with swimming for US inner-city, minority children. Empirical research on minority children's swimming ability is non-existent, and drowning rates for this population are high. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey research. Descriptive statistics were produced. Multiple regression was applied using significant demographic variables by swimming ability. SETTING: Six US cities were chosen (Chicago, Illinois; Houston, Texas; Memphis, Tennessee; Miami, Florida; Oakland, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) facilities were used to solicit subjects. SUBJECTS: A large sample (n = 1680) was gathered, which targeted poor, minority children. Parents of children aged 4-11 years and adolescents (12-17 years) completed surveys that research team members or trained YMCA staff supervised during non-swimming YMCA programmes. RESULTS: African-American respondents reported a 57.5% "at risk" (unable to swim or uncomfortable in deep end of pool) swimming ability. Hispanic/Latino children confirmed a 56.2% "at risk" level as compared with 30.9% for white subjects. Age, sex, child's lunch programme, parental education and race variables were all significantly (p<0.05) related to swimming ability. Regression analysis revealed that all demographic variables fell into a significant model (p<0.001) as predictor variables. CONCLUSIONS: Poor minority children, specifically African-American and Hispanic/Latino, are at a significant disadvantage concerning swimming ability. Female subjects were notably more "at risk" regarding their swimming ability than male subjects. Age, race and socioeconomic factors (lunch programme and parental education) were significantly associated with children who have low swimming ability.

Title:Evaluation of two novel aluminum-free, zinc-based glass polyalkenoate cements as alternatives to PMMA bone cement for use in vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty.

Abstract:Vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) are now widely used for treating patients in whom the pain due to vertebral compression fractures is severe and has proved to be refractory to conservative treatment. These procedures involve percutaneous delivery of a bolus of an injectable bone cement either directly to the fractured vertebral body, VB (VP) or to a void created in it by an inflatable bone tamp (BKP). Thus, the cement is a vital component of both procedures. In the vast majority of VPs and BKPs, a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement is used. This material has many shortcomings, notably lack of bioactivity and very limited resorbability. Thus, there is room for alternative cements. We report here on two variants of a novel, bioactive, Al-free, Zn-based glass polyalkenoate cement (Zn-GPC), and how their properties compare to those of an injectable PMMA bone cement (SIMPL) that is widely used in VP and BKP. The properties determined were injectability, radiopacity, uniaxial compressive strength, and biaxial flexural modulus. In addition, we compared the compression fatigue lives of a validated synthetic osteoporotic VB model (a polyurethane foam cube with an 8 mm-diameter through-thickness cylindrical hole), at 0-2300 N and 3 Hz, when the hole was filled with each of the three cements. A critical review of the results suggests that the performance of each of the Zn-GPCs is comparable to that of SIMPL; thus, the former cements merit further study with a view to being alternatives to an injectable PMMA cement for use in VP and BKP.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: We have recently reported that the dietary supplement Meltdown increases plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), glycerol, free fatty acids (FFA), and metabolic rate in men. However, in that investigation measurements ceased at 90 minutes post ingestion, with values for blood borne variables peaking at this time. It was the purpose of the present investigation to extend the time course of measurement to 6 hours, and to include women within the design to determine if sex differences to treatment exist. METHODS: Ten men (24 +/- 4 yrs) and 10 women (22 +/- 2 yrs) ingested Meltdown or a placebo, using a randomized, cross-over design with one week separating conditions. Blood samples were collected immediately before supplementation and at one hour intervals through 6 hours post ingestion. A standard meal was provided after the hour 3 collection. Samples were assayed for EPI, NE, glycerol, and FFA. Five minute breath samples were collected at each time for measurement of metabolic rate and substrate utilization. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded at all times. Data were also analyzed using a 2 (sex) x 2 (condition) x 7 (time) repeated measures analysis of variance, with Tukey post hoc testing. RESULTS: No sex x condition interactions were noted for AUC for any variable (p > 0.05). Hence, AUC data are collapsed across men and women. AUC was greater for Meltdown compared to placebo for EPI (367 +/- 58 pg x mL(-1) x 6 hr(-1) vs. 183 +/- 27 pg x mL(-1) x 6 hr(-1); p = 0.01), NE (2345 +/- 205 pg x mL(-1) x 6 hr(-1) vs. 1659 +/- 184 pg x mL(-1) x 6 hr(-1); p = 0.02), glycerol (79 +/- 8 microg x mL)-1) x 6 hr(-1) vs. 59 +/- 6 microg x mL(-1) x 6 hr(-1); p = 0.03), FFA (2.46 +/- 0.64 mmol x L(-1) x 6 hr(-1) vs. 1.57 +/- 0.42 mmol x L(-1) x 6 hr(-1); p = 0.05), and kilocalorie expenditure (439 +/- 26 kcal x 6 hrs(-1) vs. 380 +/- 14 kcal x 6 hrs(-1); p = 0.02). No effect was noted for substrate utilization (p = 0.39). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p < 0.0001; 1-16 mmHg), as well as heart rate (p = 0.01; 1-9 bpm) were higher for Meltdown. No sex x condition x time interactions were noted for any variable (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Ingestion of Meltdown results in an increase in catecholamine secretion, lipolysis, and metabolic rate in young men and women, with a similar response for both sexes. Meltdown may prove to be an effective intervention strategy for fat loss, assuming individuals are normotensive and their treatment is monitored by a qualified health care professional.

Abstract:The overall picture of the Arab world today is dire; no Arab country is free from political strife, foreign intervention, or the threat of terrorism. Continuing instability and the failure of national governments to uphold the rule of law and deliver on development are tearing apart the fabric of Arab societies. Internally, Arab regimes' agendas are shaped by security and their makeup by kinship and loyalty, pushing people to seek refuge within their primordial loyalties. From the outside, foreign meddling in the name of "democracy" is deepening the Arab world's instability, therefore providing justification for opponents of change to discredit the values of human rights and power sharing. In such an environment, the voiceless majority becomes the main victims, with detrimental effects on their physical and mental wellbeing. A domino-like breakdown of the Arab region, with serious consequences for world's stability, is becoming an increasingly likely scenario.

Abstract:The multisubunit anaphase promoting complex (APC) is an essential cell-cycle regulator. Although CDC26 is known to have a role in APC assembly, its molecular function has remained unclear. Biophysical, structural and genetic studies presented here reveal that CDC26 stabilizes the structure of APC6, a core TPR protein required for APC integrity. Notably, CDC26-APC6 association involves an intermolecular TPR mimic composed of one helix from each protein.

Title:Racial and ethnic differences in preferences for health states and the implications for cost-utility analysis.

Abstract:AIMS: Cost-utility analysis is an economic evaluation technique that takes into consideration individual preferences for health outcomes. It is crucial to determine whether racial and ethnic groups differ in preferences for health states because then we need to determine which group's utility score should be used to conduct a cost-utility analysis that yields equitable results to all members of society. METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted to identify the relevant studies. RESULTS: There exists a potential to either undervalue or overvalue health states along racial and ethnic lines when population-based utility scores are used for clinical or policy decision-making. Some argue that if systematic racial and ethnic differences exist, then race/ethnicity-specific measures should be incorporated in the economic evaluations, at least for interventions targeted at the prevention and treatment of diseases which disproportionately affect minorities. Yet, others believe that there are troubling social and ethical implications to using subgroup health preferences as they also have the potential to disadvantage minorities. CONCLUSIONS: Attention is required for the equity issues related to the utilizations of cost-utility analysis.

Title:Understanding the relationship between posttraumatic stress disorder and trauma cognitions: The impact of thought control strategies.
Authors:['Bennett SA', 'Beck JG', 'Clapp JD']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Department of Psychology, 202 Psychology Building, Memphis TN 38152, USA. sbnnett1@memphis.edu
Abstract:Several models of PTSD suggest that dysfunctional beliefs play an important role in the maintenance of PTSD. This study examined whether thought control strategies intermediated in the relationship between PTSD and dysfunctional cognitions. It was hypothesized that PTSD would be positively associated with dysfunctional cognitions and that negative thought control strategies (worry and self-punishment) would partially account for this relationship. These maladaptive strategies were predicted to be associated with increased levels of PTSD and more trauma-related beliefs. Additionally, it was predicted that positive thought control strategies (social control and reappraisal) would be associated with decreased levels of PTSD and fewer trauma-related beliefs. Finally, because the literature supports distraction as both an adaptive and a maladaptive thought control strategy, no a priori hypothesis was made. Results support worry and self-punishment as maladaptive intervening variables in the association between PTSD and dysfunctional cognitions, resulting in greater levels of PTSD and trauma cognitions. Social control and distraction emerged as adaptive strategies, resulting in lower levels of PTSD and trauma cognitions, while reappraisal showed no relationship with PTSD severity. Although the results are cross-sectional, continued focus on the effects of thought control strategies as meditational maintenance variables over time appears warranted.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effects of EPA/DHA supplementation on resting and exercise-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in exercise-trained men. Fourteen men supplemented with 2224 mg EPA+2208 mg DHA and a placebo for 6 weeks in a random order, double blind cross-over design (with an 8 week washout) prior to performing a 60 minute treadmill climb using a weighted pack. Blood was collected pre and post exercise and analyzed for a variety of oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers. Blood lactate, muscle soreness, and creatine kinase activity were also measured. RESULTS: Treatment with EPA/DHA resulted in a significant increase in blood levels of both EPA (18 +/- 2 micromol x L(-1) vs. 143 +/- 23 micromol x L(-1); p < 0.0001) and DHA (67 +/- 4 micromol x L(-1) vs. 157 +/- 13 micromol x L(-1); p < 0.0001), while no differences were noted for placebo. Resting levels of CRP and TNF-alpha were lower with EPA/DHA compared to placebo (p < 0.05). Resting oxidative stress markers were not different (p > 0.05). There was a mild increase in oxidative stress in response to exercise (XO and H2O2) (p < 0.05). No interaction effects were noted. However, a condition effect was noted for CRP and TNF-alpha, with lower values with the EPA/DHA condition. CONCLUSION: EPA/DHA supplementation increases blood levels of these fatty acids and results in decreased resting levels of inflammatory biomarkers in exercise-trained men, but does not appear necessary for exercise-induced attenuation in either inflammation or oxidative stress. This may be due to the finding that trained men exhibit a minimal increase in both inflammation and oxidative stress in response to moderate duration (60 minute) aerobic exercise.

Title:Development of APHAB norms for WDRC hearing aids and comparisons with original norms.
Authors:['Johnson JA', 'Cox RM', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:School of Audiology and Speech Language Pathology, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.
Abstract:OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken for two purposes: First, to provide a comparison of subjective performance and benefit measured with the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire for two groups. One group included hearing-impaired individuals using 1990s-era linear processing hearing aids. The other group included hearing-impaired individuals using more current wide-dynamic range compression (WDRC)-capable hearing aids fit using current practice protocols. The second purpose of this study was to determine whether APHAB norms derived from scores for current hearing aid users were different from the original 1995 norms. It was hypothesized that technology improvements would result in improved subjective performance for modern hearing aid wearers. DESIGN: A systematic sampling method was used to identify and recruit subjects from seven private-practice audiology clinics located across the United States. Potential subjects were limited to older hearing-impaired individuals who were wearing hearing aids capable of WDRC processing. One hundred fifty-four subjects returned completed APHAB questionnaires. Participants reported mostly moderate to moderately severe subjective hearing difficulty. RESULTS: No differences in perceived difficulty with speech communication were observed between the two groups. However, aversiveness of amplified sound was less frequently reported for users of WDRC-capable hearing aids. Norms were generated using data from all of the operationally defined successful hearing aid users in the sample and compared with the original 1995 norms. Differences between the 1995 and 2005 norms were minimal for the speech communication subscales. However, the 2005 group consistently reported less frequent difficulties with sound aversiveness (AV subscale) in the aided condition. In addition to these findings, an improvement was observed in the rate of successful adjustment to hearing aids between 1995 (43%) and 2005 (82%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, problems understanding amplified speech did not decrease in frequency when hearing aids transitioned from linear to compression processing; however, the compression capabilities of current hearing aids (with a possible contribution from noise reduction algorithms) have resulted in less negative reactions to amplified environmental sounds. This suggests that modern technology has ameliorated (to some extent) the common complaint that hearing aids cause many everyday sounds to become objectionably loud. Although the results of this study suggest that the advantages of improved technology do not lie in the domains of improved subjective speech communication performance, substantial improvement in the rate of successful adjustment to hearing aids between the 1995 and 2005 subject groups provides evidence that modern hearing aid technology has produced progress in other outcome domains.

Abstract:Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and its ether analog alkyl-glycerophosphate (AGP) elicit arterial wall remodeling when applied intralumenally into the uninjured carotid artery. LPA is the ligand of eight GPCRs and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). We pursued a gene knockout strategy to identify the LPA receptor subtypes necessary for the neointimal response in a non-injury model of carotid remodeling and also compared the effects of AGP and the PPARgamma agonist rosiglitazone (ROSI) on balloon injury-elicited neointima development. In the balloon injury model AGP significantly increased neointima; however, rosiglitazone application attenuated it. AGP and ROSI were also applied intralumenally for 1h without injury into the carotid arteries of LPA(1), LPA(2), LPA(1&2) double knockout, and Mx1Cre-inducible conditional PPARgamma knockout mice targeted to vascular smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells. The neointima was quantified and also stained for CD31, CD68, CD11b, and alpha-smooth muscle actin markers. In LPA(1), LPA(2), LPA(1&2) GPCR knockout, Mx1Cre transgenic, PPARgamma(fl/-), and uninduced Mx1CrexPPARgamma(fl/-) mice AGP- and ROSI-elicited neointima was indistinguishable in its progression and cytological features from that of WT C57BL/6 mice. In PPARgamma(-/-) knockout mice, generated by activation of Mx1Cre-mediated recombination, AGP and ROSI failed to elicit neointima and vascular wall remodeling. Our findings point to a difference in the effects of AGP and ROSI between the balloon injury- and the non-injury chemically-induced neointima. The present data provide genetic evidence for the requirement of PPARgamma in AGP- and ROSI-elicited neointimal thickening in the non-injury model and reveal that the overwhelming majority of the cells in the neointimal layer express alpha-smooth muscle actin.

Abstract:Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene knockout (KO) mice develop hearing loss, as well as hair cell damage in the inner ear. Furthermore, the hearing loss and hair cell damage may be caused and exacerbated by hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. We are therefore seeking an effective treatment to protect the inner ear in ApoE-KO mice. ApoE-KO mice fed with an atherosclerotic diet were treated with simvastatin or with Strauss Heartdrops. The auditory brainstem responses were recorded, and plasma lipid levels and inner ear histology were examined. ApoE-KO and wild-type C57BL/6J mice fed with a normal chow diet served as controls. Compared to ApoE-KO mice fed only the atherosclerotic diet, ApoE-KO mice treated with simvastatin had no significant hearing loss and less severe atherosclerosis and hair cell damage in the inner ear. However, ApoE-KO mice treated with Strauss Heartdrops developed significant hearing loss and severe atherosclerosis and hair cell damage in the inner ear. These results demonstrate that statins may prevent hearing loss and inner ear damage in ApoE-KO mice by reducing the atherosclerotic lesions and levels of glucose, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride. Statins could be used to treat hearing loss associated with hyperlipidemia.

Title:Moderators of physical activity and obesity during adolescence.
Authors:['Gamble HL', 'Parra GR', 'Beech BM']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, TN 38152, United States. gamble.heather@gmail.com
Abstract:The purpose of this study was to examine possible moderators of the relation between physical activity and obesity in adolescence. Adolescents (N=168; mean age=15.20 years; 52.4% girls; 76.8% African American) were recruited from low-income primary care medical facilities in a large southern city. Measures included Body Mass Index (BMI) percentile, physical activity, shared family physical activity, and self-efficacy for healthful eating. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate a) independent contributions of physical activity, shared family activity, and self-efficacy for healthful eating to the prediction of adolescent BMI percentile; b) interactions between shared and individual physical activity in the prediction of BMI percentile; c) interactions between self-efficacy for healthful eating and physical activity in the prediction of BMI percentile; and d) interactions among all three variables. Findings revealed self-efficacy for healthful eating was a significant moderator of the adolescent physical activity and BMI percentile relation. Conclusions emphasize the interactive nature among obesity risk factors.

Title:Upregulation of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 in adult epidermal keratinocytes in direct current electric fields.

Abstract:Electric fields (EFs) of around 100 mV/mm are present in normal healing wounds and induce the directional migration of epithelial cells. Reepithelialization during wound healing thus may be controlled in part by this electrical signal. In this study, the early transcriptional response of human epidermal keratinocytes to EFs is examined using microarrays. Increased expression of various chemokines, interleukins, and other inflammatory response genes indicates that EFs stimulate keratinocyte activation and immune stimulatory activity. Gene expression activity further suggests that interleukin 1 is either released or activated in EFs. Expression of the chemokine CCL20 steadily increases at 100 mV/mm over time until around 8 h after exposure. This chemokine is also expressed at field strengths of 300 mV/mm-above the level of endogenous wound fields. The early effects of EFs on epithelial gene expression activity identified in these studies suggest the importance of naturally occurring EFs both in repair mechanisms and for the possibility of controlling these responses therapeutically.

Title:State funding for higher education and RN replacement rates by state: a case for nursing by the numbers in state legislatures.
Authors:['Bargagliotti LA']
Affiliation:100 Newport Hall, University of Memphis Loewenberg School of Nursing, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. tbargagl@memphis.edu
Abstract:Amid an enduring nursing shortage and state budget shortfalls, discerning how the percentage of state funding to higher education and other registered nurse (RN) workforce variables may be related to the RN replacement rates (RNRR) in states has important policy implications. Regionally, the age of RNs was inversely related to RNRR. State funding in 2000 significantly predicted the 2004 RNRR, with the percentage of LPNs in 2004 adding to the model. The stability of the model using 2000 and 2004 funding data suggests that state funding creates a climate for RNRR.

Title:Optimism and pessimism in children with cancer and healthy children: confirmatory factor analysis of the youth life orientation test and relations with health-related quality of life.
Authors:['Williams NA', 'Davis G', 'Hancock M', 'Phipps S']
Affiliation:Department of Behavioral Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To test the measurement equivalence of the Youth Life Orientation Test (YLOT) in children with cancer (N = 199) and healthy controls (N = 108), and to examine optimism and pessimism as predictors of children's health-related quality of life (HRQL). METHODS: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to establish the two factor structure of the YLOT and to test for metric invariance. RESULTS: A two-factor structure for the YLOT was confirmed and found to be stable across our study groups. There were no differences in mean levels of optimism and pessimism between cancer patients and controls after controlling for race/ethnicity. Higher optimism was associated with lower self-reports of pain and better emotional/behavioral functioning, whereas pessimism was related to poorer mental health and general behavior, and greater impact on the family. CONCLUSIONS: Optimism and pessimism appear to be differentially related to certain aspects of children's HRQL, and should be investigated separately in relation to these outcomes.

Title:Molecular dynamics simulations of DNA-polycation complex formation.
Authors:['Ziebarth J', 'Wang Y']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:Complexes formed from DNA and polycations are of interest because of their potential use in gene therapy; however, there remains a lack of understanding of the structure and formation of DNA-polycation complexes at atomic scale. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations of the DNA duplex d(CGCGAATTCGCG) in the presence of polycation chains are carried out to shed light on the specific atomic interaction that result in complex formation. The structures of complexes formed from DNA with polyethylenimine, which is considered one of the most promising DNA vector candidates, and a second polycation, poly-L-lysine, are compared. After an initial separation of approximately 50 A, the DNA and polycation come together and form a stable complex within 10 ns. The DNA does not undergo any major structural changes on complexation and remains in the B-form. In the formed complex, the charged amine groups of the polycation mainly interact with DNA phosphate groups, with polycation intrusion into the major and minor grooves dependent on the identity and charge state of the polycation. The ability of the polycation to effectively neutralize the charge of the DNA phosphate groups and the resulting influence on the DNA helix interaction are discussed.

Title:The drive for muscularity in men: media influences and objectification theory.
Authors:['Daniel S', 'Bridges SK']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, United States.
Abstract:Presently, objectification theory has yielded mixed results when utilized to explain body image concerns in men. An online survey assessing internalization of media ideals, self-objectification, body surveillance, body shame, the drive for muscularity, and body mass index (BMI) was completed by 244 predominantly college-aged males. Path analyses were used to investigate relationships among these variables where it was hypothesized that objectification variables would mediate the relationship between internalization of media ideals and the drive for muscularity. Internalization of media ideals was the strongest predictor of the drive for muscularity, followed by BMI, though variables of objectification theory had no impact on the drive for muscularity contrary to hypotheses. The results suggest that objectification theory may not be applicable to men as it is currently measured.

Title:The linguistic and embodied nature of conceptual processing.
Authors:['Louwerse MM', 'Jeuniaux P']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, United States. mlouwerse@memphis.edu
Abstract:Recent theories of cognition have argued that embodied experience is important for conceptual processing. Embodiment can be contrasted with linguistic factors such as the typical order in which words appear in language. Here, we report four experiments that investigated the conditions under which embodiment and linguistic factors determine performance. Participants made speeded judgments about whether pairs of words or pictures were semantically related or had an iconic relationship. The embodiment factor was operationalized as the degree to which stimulus pairs were presented in the spatial configurations in which they usually occur (i.e., an iconic configuration, e.g., attic presented above basement). The linguistic factor was operationalized as the frequency of the stimulus pairs in language. The embodiment factor predicted error rates and response time better for pictures, whereas the linguistic factor predicted error rates and response time better for words. These findings were modified by task, with the embodiment factor being strongest in iconicity judgments for pictures and the linguistic factor being strongest in semantic judgments for words. Both factors predicted error rates and response time for both semantic and iconicity judgments. These findings support the view that conceptual processing is both linguistic and embodied, with a bias for the embodiment or the linguistic factor depending on the nature of the task and the stimuli.

Abstract:Sedentary, consumption-based lifestyles are placing entire populations at serious health risks; obesity is a prime example. The individual approach to obesity, which targets those at risk, has largely failed because it ignores wider influences on behavior. Although the population-ecological approach is gaining support, it cannot disentangle clear targets for policy change. Consequently, health promotion has been relegated to the mass marketing of healthy behaviors, which is based on a rational notion that informed people tend to behave in their best interest. Creating environments that support behavior change and providing individuals incentives can be more effective to reduce lifestyle-related risks. A paradigm shift from trying to sell health to the public to creating the conditions whereby healthy choices become accessible and affordable is required.

Abstract:This article reviews the normal development of sleep in infants, children, and adolescents, with specific focus on both the subjective and objective aspects of sleep. Notably, sleep duration decreases substantially from infancy through adolescence with increased consolidation of sleep to the nighttime period only. Sleep architecture exhibits developmental changes with decreases in slow-wave sleep and increases in stage 2 sleep from childhood through adolescence. Although the development of sleep is a dramatic and relatively rapid process during the first decades of life, changes in sleep continue across the life span.

Abstract:A laboratory-built automated instrument is reported for on-line, near real-time monitoring of nine haloacetic acids species (HAA9) in drinking water. The device uses anion-exchange chromatography to separate the HAA9 species, followed by post-column reaction with nicotinamide in basic solution with fluorescence detection. Method detection limits for HAA9 species ranged from 0.6 to 10.1microgL(-1), mean % recovery values ranged from 58 to 161%, and % relative standard deviation ranged from 3.5 to 32% while operating within a factor of 2.5-5 of the method detection limit. The bias between the proposed method and United States Environmental Protection Agency Method 552.3 was measured during two separate on-line studies and using grab samples collected from different distribution systems. In general, the two methods showed good agreement with biases for HAA9 of less than 10microgL(-1).

Title:Muscarinic receptor blockade in the ventral tegmental area attenuates cocaine enhancement of laterodorsal tegmentum stimulation-evoked accumbens dopamine efflux in the mouse.
Authors:['Lester DB', 'Miller AD', 'Blaha CD']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:The reinforcing properties of cocaine have been related to increased extracellular concentrations of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) on dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) facilitate mesoaccumbens dopamine transmission and are critically involved in mediating natural and drug reinforcement. We investigated the effects of pharmacological blockade of mAChRs in the VTA on cocaine's ability to enhance electrically evoked NAc dopamine efflux. Using fixed potential amperometry together with carbon fiber recording microelectrodes positioned in the NAc core, we quantified dopamine oxidation currents (dopamine efflux) evoked by brief stimulation (15 monophasic pulses at 50 Hz every 30 s) of the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) in urethane (1.5 g/kg, i.p.) anesthetized mice. Compared to predrug baseline responses, cocaine (5 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently enhanced LDT stimulation-evoked NAc dopamine efflux, whereas the nonsubtype selective mAChR antagonist scopolamine (10 microg/0.5 microl) microinfused into the VTA diminished LDT-evoked NAc dopamine efflux. Preinfusion of scopolamine into the VTA diminished the facilitatory actions of cocaine on LDT stimulation-evoked NAc dopamine efflux, and when infused at the peak effect of cocaine attenuated LDT-evoked dopamine efflux to below predrug baseline levels. These findings suggest that LDT cholinergic inputs to dopamine neurons in the VTA, via activation of mAChRs (probably of the M5 subtype), are involved in modulating the facilitatory effects of cocaine on NAc dopamine neurotransmission. They also suggest that the development of antagonists aimed at selectively disrupting M5 receptor function may be valuable in reducing abuse liability of psychostimulants.

Abstract:Exploring the relationship between parenting and women's use of violence the current study surveyed 106 mothers arrested for intimate partner violence (IPV) related crimes on parenting styles and attitudes toward when using violence against their partner is justified. Findings indicate parenting styles indicative of low belief in using physical discipline with their child/ children and an internal parental locus of control. However, a moderate to weak relationship between parenting styles and justification for using violence against a partner was also found. Although some support for the spillover theory is noted, results are far from conclusive.

Title:Dependence of in vitro fatigue properties of PMMA bone cement on the polydispersity index of its powder.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Li Y']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:Four variants of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement were used, the difference being in the method used to sterilize the powder (three different dosages of gamma irradiation and ethylene oxide gas) and, hence, in the molecular weight of the powder. For each cement powder, the number-average molecular weight and weight-average molecular weight (and, hence, the polydispersity index, PDI) were determined using gel permeation chromatography. For each of the cured cements, the fatigue lives (N(f)) of specimens, at loads corresponding to stresses (S) of +/-10.0 MPa, +/-12.5 MPa, +/-15.0 MPa, and +/-20.0 MPa, were determined using the protocol detailed in ASTM F2118-03. Hence, the values of the three Weibull parameters were determined for each cement set-S combination. From these results, one index of the fatigue life of the cement, namely, the Weibull mean fatigue life (N(WM)), was computed for each combination. For each cement, the Olgive equation was fitted to the S-N(f) results, yielding an estimate of another fatigue property, the cement's fatigue limit. Best-fit empirical relationships (1) betweenlnN(WM), S, and PDI, and (2) between the estimated fatigue limit and PDI were obtained. These relationships may be used in the development of new cement powder sterilization methods.

Abstract:Stressful conditions during development may have lasting consequences for an animal's lifetime fitness. We investigated the degree to which parental provisioning and nest attendance influenced baseline levels of the stress hormone corticosterone in nestling Florida scrub-jays. Provisioning rates of male and female breeders and nest attendance of female breeders were recorded during focal watches conducted between days 3 and 5 post-hatch. A small blood sample was taken from each nestling on day 11 post-hatch and used to quantify levels of baseline corticosterone. The proportion of time spent by female breeders at a considerable distance from the nest was positively related to nestling corticosterone levels. Nestling corticosterone was also negatively related to parental provisioning rate, although this effect seemed to be secondary to the effect of the female's time away from the nest. These results indicate that parental behavior contributes to nestling stress physiology, which may in turn direct the formation of the adult phenotype and influence an individual's chances of survival.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Postnatal introduction of probiotics results in a low incidence of colonization, whereas maternal fecal and vaginal bacteria colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of vaginally delivered infants. OBJECTIVE: We tested if probiotic bacteria, fed to three pregnant animal models, would colonize the GIT of offspring delivered vaginally. METHODS: Probiotic strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis were fed to pregnant mice, rats, and sows for at least 7 days prior to vaginal delivery. Cultural approaches and genotyping were used to determine if the probiotic bacteria colonized the GIT after birth. RESULTS: The probiotic bacteria were detected in the feces and vagina of maternal mice, rats, and sows after, but not before, administration. L. acidophilus was detected at postnatal day 14 in 22, 33, and 75% of the mice, rats, and pigs, respectively, and after weaning in 35% of the mice and 1 of 5 pigs. B. lactis was present at postnatal day 14 in 30 and 80% of the mice and pigs. Bacterial assemblages in the GIT of the colonized young differed from those in which the probiotics were not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic bacteria administered to mothers during late gestation are transferred to infants born vaginally and influence the assemblages of GIT bacteria. However, colonization of the neonatal GIT and persistence past weaning does not occur in all offspring and varies among probiotics and animal models.

Abstract:Injections of silicone fluid have been clinically evaluated to treat and prevent foot ulcers due to diminished plantar fat-pad in neuropathic diabetics. The objective of this study was to determine preliminary in vitro effects of an injectable form of silicone resin particles in combination with growth factors to determine the suitability of this potential therapy for prevention of diabetic foot ulcers. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) were added to monolayer culture along with silicone resin particles (12 microm average diameter). Growth factors were also combined as follows: bFGF+PDGF-BB, EGF+PDGF-BB, and bFGF+EGF. Growth factors alone and in combination increased fibroblast proliferation, but the presence of particles did not significantly affect cellular proliferation. The addition of particles significantly increased fibronectin production 117% in the control group and 151% in the PDGF only group. Collagen production was increased with exposure to EGF and growth factor combinations, but the presence of particles did not lead to any significant differences, except an 81% increase in the bFGF group. These preliminary results suggest that a combination of PDGF and bFGF may be effective in stimulating proliferation and matrix production around injectable silicone resin particles to generate a fibrous tissue pad to alleviate the abnormal distribution of high pressures that contribute to diabetic foot ulcer formation.

Abstract:UNLABELLED: High-kilocalorie feedings induce oxidative stress. Acute exercise has the potential to attenuate postprandial oxidative stress. No study has determined whether there are racial differences in postprandial oxidative stress with and without a preceding bout of acute exercise. PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of acute exercise on blood oxidative-stress biomarkers, triglycerides (TAG), and glucose in African American (AA) and White (W) women. METHODS: 10 AA (age 29 +/- 3 yr, body-mass index [BMI] 31 +/- 3 kg/m(2)) and 10 W (age 30 +/- 2 yr, BMI 30 +/- 3 kg/m(2)) women consumed a meal of 1.2 g of fat and carbohydrate and 0.25 g of protein per kilogram body mass, on 2 occasions-with and without a session of aerobic exercise 15 min preceding the meal (45 min cycling at 65% heart-rate reserve)--in a random-order crossover design. Blood samples were collected premeal (fasted), and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hr postmeal and assayed for TAG, glucose, xanthine oxidase activity, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and malondialdehyde (MDA). Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each variable. RESULTS: AUC was lower for AA compared with W for both the exercise and the no exercise conditions for H2O2, MDA, and TAG (p < .01). However, acute exercise had no effect on decreasing the AUC for any variable in either AA or W women (p > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Postprandial lipemia and oxidative stress are lower in AA than in W overweight/obese women. However, acute exercise, performed at the intensity and duration in the current study, does not influence postprandial lipemia or oxidative stress in AA or W women.

Abstract:UNLABELLED: An individual's sex and exercise training status may influence oxidative stress. No study has compared postprandial oxidative stress in exercise-trained and untrained men and women. PURPOSE: To compare oxidative stress biomarkers and triglycerides (TAG) in 16 trained and 16 untrained men and women after ingestion of a high-fat meal. METHODS: Blood samples were collected before, and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after intake of a high-fat meal and analyzed for Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, xanthine oxidase activity, protein carbonyls (PC), and TAG. Area under the curve was calculated for each variable. RESULTS: Sex main effects were noted for all variables (P < 0.01), except for PC and TEAC (P > 0.05), with higher values for men compared with women. A training status main effect was noted for TEAC (P = 0.02), with higher values for trained compared with untrained subjects. No interaction effects were noted (P > 0.05). Regression analysis indicated that TAG explained the greatest degree of variability for oxidative stress variables, and premeal TAG best predicted the TAG response to feeding (R(2) = 0.50). CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of TEAC, for which higher values were noted for trained compared with untrained subjects, our findings indicate that sex, not exercise training status, influences postprandial oxidative stress. Specifically, women experience a significantly lower oxidative stress response to feeding compared with men. This seems mediated in part by the TAG response to feeding.

Title:Measurement of body composition in 8-10-year-old African-American girls: a comparison of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and foot-to-foot bioimpedance methods.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate body composition outcomes of foot-to-foot (FF) bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and dual-energy x-ray (DEXA) in 8 to 10-year-old African-American girls and, if different, to develop and cross-validate specific BIA prediction equations for this at-risk group. METHODS: DEXA and FF-BIA body composition outcomes were analyzed in 183, 8-10-year-old African-American girls from the Memphis site of the Girls health Enrichment Multi-site Study (GEMS). RESULTS: Mean body composition outcomes by FF-BIA and DEXA were significantly different (p<0.0001); therefore, population-specific equations were developed and cross-validated using split-sample, cross-validation methods. When equations were used, BIA and DEXA outcomes were significantly correlated (percent body fat [r=0.931], fat mass [r=0.985], and fat-free mass [r=0.944]). Mean predicted BIA measurements for body fat, fat mass, and fat-free mass were essentially equal to their counterpart DEXA measurements (t[182]=- 0.013, p = 0.897, t[182]=- 0.06, p=0.956, and t[182]=- 0.26, p=0.792, respectively). The Bland-Altman analysis revealed a significant slope for percent fat (p=0.009) and slopes approaching significance for fat mass (p=0.07) and fat-free mass (p=0.06). CONCLUSION: Although FF-BIA and DEXA are not directly interchangeable in young African-American girls, these equations accurately estimated average percent fat, fat mass, and fat-free mass of the cross-validation sample of African-American girls. However, the application of this equation may result in potential underestimation or overestimation of fat with respect to DEXA measures in some populations.

Title:Lab-on-chip flow injection analysis system without an external pump and valves and integrated with an in line electrochemical detector.
Authors:['Chen IJ', 'Lindner E']
Affiliation:Biomedical Engineering Department, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Surface energy in small droplets can be used to drive samples through microchannels. When a sample fluid is spontaneously driven through a solution filled microchannel with liquid droplets on its entry (sample) and exit (reservoir) ports, it is termed as a passive pumping device. A passive pump driven microfluidic system integrated with microfabricated planar electrodes or electrode arrays (e.g., interdigitated electrode arrays or microband electrode arrays) can be considered as a manifold for flow injection analysis without an external pump and injector valve. Factors affecting the passive pump driven flow rate in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-glass hybrid microfluidic system, including the volume, viscosity, and surface tension of the sample solution and the tilt of the microfluidic channel, are analyzed. By placing 2 microL of hexacyanoferrate (II) solutions at the entry port of the device, peak shaped transients were recorded. The peak heights showed linear dependence on the sample concentrations between 3 x 10(-7) and 10(-5) M.

Title:A single automated instrument for monitoring total trihalomethane and total haloacetic acid concentrations in near real-time.
Authors:['Emmert GL', 'Geme G', 'Brown MA', 'Simone PS Jr']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. gemmert@memphis.edu
Abstract:A single instrument is presented for selectively measuring the concentrations of total trihalomethanes (THM4) and total haloacetic acids (HAA9) directly from drinking water distribution systems. The method is based on the fluorescence reaction of THM4 or HAA5 species with nicotinamide. The method detection limit (MDL) for THM4 was 2.5 microg L(-1) with mean % recovery of 108% and % relative standard deviation (% R.S.D.) of 4%. For HAA5, the MDL was 3.3 microg L(-1) with mean % recovery and % R.S.D. of 102% and 3.5%, respectively. Side-by-side comparisons to United States Environmental Protection Agency methods (Methods 502.2 and 552.3) in chlorinated and chloraminated distribution systems exhibited reproducible biases that ranged from approximately 0.2 to 5 microg L(-1) for THM4 and from approximately -0.7 to -27 microg L(-1) for HAA5. The device provides for automated on-line sampling and analysis of THM4 and HAA9 with hourly sample analysis rates and is effectively a real-time system for drinking water monitoring.

Title:Random damage and characteristics of debris particles are two important and yet ignored factors in the mechanical integrity of the stem-cement interface of a total hip replacement: influence of the surface finish of the metal stem.

Abstract:The importance of the conditions at the stem-cement interface in cemented total joint replacements (THRs) with regard to the in vivo longevity of the implant is well recognized. In the present study, we used a simplified model of one part of a cemented THR (alloy rectangular beam bonded to rectangular cement plate) to study the influence of surface finish of the alloy beam (stem) on two measures of the evolution of random damage at the alloy beam-cement plate interface (stem-cement interface), under quasi-static direct shear load. Three surface finishes of the beams were used: satin-finish, grit-blasted, and plasma-sprayed. The random damage events were monitored from the emitted acoustic signals, with the two measures computed from these signals being the intensity of random damage events (IRDE) and the mean damage event energy (MDEE). Large number of random damage events (higher values of IRDE and low value of MDEE) occurred with grit blasted specimens, suggesting a high probability for the generation of debris particles at the interface. These findings, in conjunction with details on the size and shape of the debris particles, obtained using scanning electron microscopy, lead to the suggestion that satin-finish stems are desirable for use in cemented THRs.

Title:Understanding the protonation behavior of linear polyethylenimine in solutions through Monte Carlo simulations.
Authors:['Ziebarth JD', 'Wang Y']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38154, USA.
Abstract:The success of polyethyleneimine (PEI) as a nonviral-based gene delivery vector has been attributed to its proton buffering capacity. Despite the great interest in PEI for its use in nonviral-based gene delivery, the protonation behavior of PEI in solution is not well understood. Earlier experimental studies have reported inconsistent values of the protonation state of PEI. In this work, we report our investigation of the protonation behavior of a realistic linear PEI (lPEI) with computational approaches. Reported experimental pK(a) values of several diamine compounds are first examined. A screened Coulombic interaction with a distance dependence dielectric is shown to reproduce the shifted pK(a) values of the model diamine compounds. Then atomistic molecular dynamic simulations of lPEI chain with 20 repeating units are performed and the results are used to provide parameters for a coarse-grained polyamine model. The screened Coulombic interaction is then incorporated in the coarse-grained lPEI chain and computational titrations are performed. The obtained computational titration curves of lPEI in solutions were found to be in best agreement with experimental results by Smits et al., but the computational titration curves have too strong of a dependence on salt concentration compared to the experimental results by Smits et al. Disregarding the discrepancy in the salt dependence, our computational titrations reveal that approximately 55% of the lPEI amine groups are protonated under physiological conditions in solution with a nearly alternating arrangement of protonated and nonprotonated amines. Titrations of lPEI in the presence of a polyanion are also performed to determine how the charge state of lPEI could be affected by complexation with DNA in gene therapy preparations. While the presence of the polyanion increases the degree of protonation of the PEI, many of PEI amines remain unprotonated under physiological conditions, providing evidence that PEI complexed with DNA could still have proton buffering capacity. Potential sources of error that have resulted in the inconsistency of previously reported protonation states of PEI were also discussed.

Abstract:In this study, fixed potential amperometry was used to examine several pathways by which Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or dopamine axons within the dorsal forebrain bundle (DFB) release striatal dopamine, thus potentially providing therapeutic benefits for Parkinson's Disease patients. In urethane anesthetized mice, electrical stimulations (20 monophasic pulses at 50 Hz every 30 sec) were applied to the STN or DFB while infusing the local anesthetic lidocaine (4%) into the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) or pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT). Findings suggest that DFB stimulation activates ascending SNc dopamine axons, while STN stimulation evokes striatal dopamine release directly via excitatory glutamatergic inputs to SNc dopamine cells and indirectly via excitatory cholinergic/glutamatergic STN-PPT-SNc pathways.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to summarize the research regarding Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake among families with adolescent/preadolescent daughters. METHODS: Literature searches (utilizing PubMed and PsychInfo databases) were conducted and research examining psychological and environmental factors which relate to HPV vaccine uptake and intentions was reviewed. RESULTS: Factors such as physician recommendations, perceptions of the beliefs of peers and significant others, history of childhood immunizations, and communication with adolescents regarding sexual topics appear to influence HPV vaccination outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although primary prevention of cervical and other cancers is available for preadolescent and adolescent girls, rates of HPV vaccine uptake are low. Future interventions should target vaccine intent and physician/family communication as a means to increasing HPV vaccination.

Title:Characterization of non-lipid autotaxin inhibitors.
Authors:['Hoeglund AB', 'Howard AL', 'Wanjala IW', 'Pham TC', 'Parrill AL', 'Baker DL']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, United States.
Abstract:Autotaxin (ATX) is a member of the ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP) family and is a lysophospholipase D that cleaves the choline headgroup from lysophosphatidylcholine to generate the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Enhanced expression of ATX and specific receptors for LPA in numerous cancer cell types has created an interest in studying ATX as a potential chemotherapeutic target. Likewise, ATX has been linked to several additional human diseases including multiple sclerosis, diabetes, obesity, neuropathic pain, and Alzheimer's disease. ATX inhibitors reported to date consist of metal ion chelators, lipid-like product analogs, and non-lipid small molecules. In the current research, we examined the pharmacology of the best of our previously reported non-lipid small molecule inhibitors. Here, these six inhibitors were studied utilizing the synthetic fluorescent lysophospholipid substrate FS-3, the nucleotide substrate pNP-TMP and the endogenous substrate LPC (16:0). All six compounds inhibited FS-3 hydrolysis >or=50%, whereas only three inhibited the hydrolysis of pNP-TMP to this degree. None of the six compounds blocked LPC 16:0 hydrolysis within the desired 50% inhibition range. The most potent analog (5, H2L 7905958) displayed an IC(50) of 1.6microM (K(i)=1.9microM, competitive inhibition) with respect to ATX-mediated FS-3 hydrolysis and an IC(50) of 1.2microM (K(i)=K(i)(')=6.5microM, non-competitive inhibition) against ATX-mediated pNP-TMP hydrolysis. All six inhibitors were specific for ATX as they were without affect on two additional lipid preferring NPP isoforms.

Abstract:Bicalutamide is the most widely used non-steroidal antiandrogen for treating early stage prostate cancer, but suffers variable oral absorption due to its limited aqueous solubility. Thus, our objective was to synthesize novel biodegradable copolymers for the systemic micellar delivery of bicalutamide. Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (cFH) was used to assess compatibility between bicalutamide and poly(L-lactide) or poly(carbonate-co-lactide) polymer pairs. Polyethylene glycol-b-poly(carbonate-co-lactide) [PEG-b-P(CB-co-LA)] copolymers were synthesized and characterized by NMR and gel permeation chromatography. These micelles had average diameter of 100 nm and had a smooth surface and distinct spherical shape. Drug loading studies revealed that adding the carbonate monomer could increase bicalutamide loading. Among the series, drug loading of micelles formulated with PEG-b-P(CB-co-LA) copolymer containing 20 mol% carbonate was about four-fold higher than PEG-b-PLLA and aqueous solubility of bicalutamide increased from 5 to 4000 microg/mL. CMC values for PEG-b-P(CB-co-LA) copolymers was up to 10-fold lower than those of PEG-b-PLLA. In vitro release experiments showed PEG-b-P(CB-co-LA) copolymers to be more efficient in sustaining the release of bicalutamide compared to PEG-b-PLLA. Bicalutamide-loaded PEG-b-P(CB-co-LA) micelles showed significant inhibition of LNCaP cell growth in a dose-dependent manner which was similar to the methanol solution of free drug.

Abstract:TDP-43 is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed member of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family of proteins. Recently, TDP-43 was shown to be a major disease protein in the ubiquitinated inclusions characteristic of most cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), tau-negative frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and inclusion body myopathy. In these diseases, TDP-43 is redistributed from its predominantly nuclear location to ubiquitin-positive, cytoplasmic foci. The extent to which TDP-43 drives pathophysiology is unknown, but the identification of mutations in TDP-43 in familial forms of ALS and FTLD-U suggests an important role for this protein in pathogenesis. Little is known about TDP-43 function and only a few TDP-43 interacting proteins have been previously identified, which makes further insight into both the normal and pathological functions of TDP-43 difficult. Here we show, via a global proteomic approach, that TDP-43 has extensive interaction with proteins that regulate RNA metabolism. Some interactions with TDP-43 were found to be dependent on RNA-binding, whereas other interactions are RNA-independent. Disease-causing mutations in TDP-43 (A315T and M337V) do not alter its interaction profile. TDP-43 interacting proteins largely cluster into two distinct interaction networks, a nuclear/splicing cluster and a cytoplasmic/translation cluster, strongly suggesting that TDP-43 has multiple roles in RNA metabolism and functions in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Finally, we found numerous TDP-43 interactors that are known components of stress granules, and indeed, we find that TDP-43 is also recruited to stress granules.

Title:Disease mutations in Rab7 result in unregulated nucleotide exchange and inappropriate activation.

Abstract:Rab GTPases are molecular switches that orchestrate vesicular trafficking, maturation and fusion by cycling between an active, GTP-bound form, and an inactive, GDP-bound form. The activity cycle is coupled to GTP hydrolysis and is tightly controlled by regulatory proteins. Missense mutations of the GTPase Rab7 cause a dominantly inherited axonal degeneration known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B through an unknown mechanism. We present the 2.8 A crystal structure of GTP-bound L129F mutant Rab7 which reveals normal conformations of the effector binding regions and catalytic site, but an alteration to the nucleotide binding pocket that is predicted to alter GTP binding. Through extensive biochemical analysis, we demonstrate that disease-associated mutations in Rab7 do not lead to an intrinsic GTPase defect, but permit unregulated nucleotide exchange leading to both excessive activation and hydrolysis-independent inactivation. Consistent with augmented activity, mutant Rab7 shows significantly enhanced interaction with a subset of effector proteins. In addition, dynamic imaging demonstrates that mutant Rab7 is abnormally retained on target membranes. However, we show that the increased activation of mutant Rab7 is counterbalanced by unregulated, GTP hydrolysis-independent membrane cycling. Notably, disease mutations are able to rescue the membrane cycling of a GTPase-deficient mutant. Thus, we demonstrate that disease mutations uncouple Rab7 from the spatial and temporal control normally imposed by regulatory proteins and cause disease not by a gain of novel toxic function, but by misregulation of native Rab7 activity.

Abstract:Directed assembly of nanostructures within temporary and recyclable self-assembled scaffolds is emerging as an attractive method for the synthesis of nanomaterials with programmed properties. Understanding interactions of building blocks with amphiphilic scaffolds is critical for rational design of new nanostructures and nanodevices. Here we examine loading of hydrophobic monomers into bilayers with different curvatures. Time-resolved loading was studied by high performance liquid chromatography and dynamic light scattering. Despite differences in initial bilayer geometry, loading rates and maximum bilayer capacity are the same for liposomes with radii ranging from 25 to 100 nm. When using divinylbenzene (DVB) and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), monomer/lipid loading ratio of 1.2 was achieved within 12 h. While accommodation of a large amount of monomers is likely to be accompanied with significant changes in bilayer structure, all liposomes in this study including those with smallest size and higher bilayer curvature retain encapsulated content and show no evidence of fusion during monomer loading. These results contribute to our understanding of interactions between hydrophobic molecules and lipid bilayers and expand the scope of the directed assembly method.

Abstract:Autotaxin (ATX, NPP2) has recently been shown to be the lysophospholipase D responsible for synthesis of the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). LPA has a well-established role in cancer, and the production of LPA is consistent with the cancer-promoting actions of ATX. Increased ATX and LPA receptor expression have been found in numerous cancer cell types. The current study has combined ligand-based computational approaches (binary quantitative structure-activity relationship), medicinal chemistry, and experimental enzymatic assays to optimize a previously identified small molecule ATX inhibitor, H2L 7905958 (1). Seventy prospective analogs were analyzed via computational screening, from which 30 promising compounds were synthesized and screened to assess efficacy, potency, and mechanism of inhibition. This approach has identified four analogs as potent as or more potent than the lead. The most potent analog displayed an IC(50) of 900 nM with respect to ATX-mediated FS-3 hydrolysis with a K(i) of 700 nM, making this compound approximately 3-fold more potent than the previously described lead.

Title:Systemic oxidative stress is increased to a greater degree in young, obese women following consumption of a high fat meal.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ', 'Fisher-Wellman KH']
Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu
Abstract:High fat meals induce oxidative stress, which is associated with the pathogenesis of disease. Obese individuals have elevated resting biomarkers of oxidative stress compared to non-obese. We compared blood oxidative stress biomarkers in obese (n = 14; 30 +/- 2 years; BMI 35 +/- 1 kg x m(-2)) and non-obese (n = 16; 24 +/- 2 years; BMI 23 +/- 1 kg x m(-2)) women, in response to a high fat meal. Blood samples were collected pre-meal (fasted), and at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post meal, and assayed for trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), xanthine oxidase activity (XO), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), malondialdehyde (MDA), triglycerides (TAG), and glucose. An obesity status effect was noted for all variables (p < 0.001; MDA p = 0.05), with obese women having higher values than non-obese, except for TEAC, for which values were lower. Time main effects were noted for all variables (p </= 0.01) except for TEAC and glucose, with XO, H(2)O(2), MDA and TAG increasing following feeding with a peak response at the four or six hour post feeding time point. While values tended to decline by six hours post feeding in the non-obese women (agreeing with previous studies), they were maintained (MDA) or continued to increase (XO, H(2)O(2) and TAG) in the obese women. While no interaction effects were noted (p > 0.05), contrasts revealed greater values in obese compared to non-obese women for XO, H(2)O(2), MDA, TAG and glucose, and lower values for TEAC at times from 1-6 hours post feeding (p </= 0.03). We conclude that young, obese women experience a similar pattern of increase in blood oxidative stress biomarkers in response to a high fat meal, as compared to non-obese women. However, the overall oxidative stress is greater in obese women, and values appear to remain elevated for longer periods of time post feeding. These data provide insight into another potential mechanism related to obesity-mediated morbidity.

Title:Oxidative stress and antioxidant defense mechanisms linked to exercise during cardiopulmonary and metabolic disorders.
Authors:['Fisher-Wellman K', 'Bell HK', 'Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathophysiology of multiple human diseases, in addition to the aging process. Although various stimuli exist, acute exercise is known to induce a transient increase in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), evident by several reports of increased oxidative damage following acute bouts of aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Although the results are somewhat mixed and appear disease dependent, individuals with chronic disease experience an exacerbation in oxidative stress following acute exercise when compared to healthy individuals. However, this increased oxidant stress may serve as a necessary "signal" for the upregulation in antioxidant defenses, thereby providing protection against subsequent exposure to prooxidant environments within susceptible individuals. Here we present studies related to both acute exercise-induced oxidative stress in those with disease, in addition to studies focused on adaptations resulting from increased RONS exposure associated with chronic exercise training in persons with disease.

Title:Acute exercise does not attenuate postprandial oxidative stress in prediabetic women.

Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Individuals with impaired lipid and glucose metabolism are at increased risk for postprandial oxidative stress. Acute exercise can attenuate the rise in both blood triglyceride (TAG) and glucose, and increase antioxidant enzyme activity after food intake, which may decrease the oxidative stress response. This study investigated the effect of acute exercise on blood TAG and oxidative stress biomarkers in prediabetic women. Sixteen prediabetic women (30 +/- 3 years of age; fasting blood glucose, 107 +/- 3 mg x dL(-1); body mass index, 32 +/- 2 kg x m(-2)) consumed a high-fat meal with and without a session of aerobic exercise 15 minutes preceding the meal (45-minute duration, 65% heart rate reserve), in a random order cross-over design. Blood samples were collected premeal (fasted) and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postmeal and assayed for Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), xanthine oxidase (XO) activity, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), TAG, and glucose. No interaction or condition main effects were noted (P > 0.05). However, time main effects were noted for XO, H2O2, MDA, and TAG (P < 0.0001), with values higher from 1 to 6 hours postmeal compared with premeal, and for TEAC (P = 0.05), with values lower at 4 hours postmeal. Glucose remained relatively unchanged (P > 0.05). Acute exercise, performed at the intensity and duration of the present study, does not influence postprandial TAG and oxidative stress in obese prediabetic women. Such individuals may need a greater volume of exercise for measurable effects.

Abstract:Proper management of bioinformatics data and tools is crucial because the amount of data is enormous, the type of data varies, and there are often different approaches (and consequently tools) for solving a particular problem. While specialised systems exist to serve specific needs, such systems are difficult to adapt and require large resource commitments for development and maintenance. We propose a system called Bioinformatics Tools and Data Management System (BioTDMS) that uses open-source technologies to provide a platform for managing both data and tools. We present case studies that show some potential applications of this system.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Clear evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions can be helpful in the treatment of youth who are overweight, but translational research is needed to address the gap between treatment research and clinical care. DESIGN: This meta-analysis integrated the results of 66 treatment-control comparisons and 59 alternate treatment comparisons evaluating lifestyle interventions for children and adolescents who were overweight. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Between-groups differences in weight-related outcomes and other health-related behaviors at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Lifestyle interventions were effective in a range of settings and with a range of participants. Even relatively brief programs had benefits apparent months after the end of treatment. A key component appeared to be the expectation that parents would be actively involved in treatment. Program benefits included not only better weight management but also better eating habits. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that lifestyle interventions can be effective under a wide range of conditions not limited to the highly controlled conditions of efficacy studies. Parent involvement is associated with significantly better results.

Title:Ethical challenges of military social workers serving in a combat zone.
Authors:['Simmons CA', 'Rycraft JR']
Affiliation:College of Social Work, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN 38163, USA. cathysimmons@utk.edu
Abstract:Often faced with ethical challenges that may appear extraordinary, military social workers comprise a distinctive subgroup of the social work profession. From the unique paradigms in which they practice their craft, obvious questions about how military social workers address the ethical challenges inherent to their wartime mission arise. Using a concept mapping design, this qualitative phenomenological study addresses some of the ethical challenges faced by 24 military social workers who were deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (combat operations inAfghanistan).The results visually display approaches to dealing with the ethical concern of balancing the needs of the client and the needs of the military combat mission. Most participants reported that they used clinical judgment rather than moral reasoning when dealing with such situations. Other ethical concerns are also explored: confidentiality and privacy, conflicts with commanders, relationships and boundaries, and diagnosis and treatment. Understanding of these ethical challenges is relevant to all social workers as they represent an important component of the values,knowledge, and skills germane to the social work profession.

Title:Metabolites produced by probiotic Lactobacilli rapidly increase glucose uptake by Caco-2 cells.
Authors:['Rooj AK', 'Kimura Y', 'Buddington RK']
Affiliation:Department of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, 38152-3480, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Although probiotic bacteria and their metabolites alter enterocyte gene expression, rapid, non-genomic responses have not been examined. The present study measured accumulation of tracer (2 microM) glucose by Caco-2 cells after exposure for 10 min or less to a chemically defined medium (CDM) with different monosaccharides before and after anaerobic culture of probiotic Lactobacilli. RESULTS: Growth of L. acidophilus was supported by CDM with 110 mM glucose, fructose, and mannose, but not with arabinose, ribose, and xylose or the sugar-free CDM. Glucose accumulation was reduced when Caco-2 cells were exposed for 10 min to sterile CDM with glucose (by 92%), mannose (by 90%), fructose (by 55%), and ribose (by 16%), but not with arabinose and xylose. Exposure of Caco-2 cells for 10 min to bacteria-free supernatants prepared after exponential (48 h) and stationary (72 h) growth phases of L. acidophilus cultured in CDM with 110 mM fructose increased glucose accumulation by 83% and 45%, respectively; exposure to a suspension of the bacteria had no effect. The increase in glucose accumulation was diminished by heat-denaturing the supernatant, indicating the response of Caco-2 cells is triggered by as yet unknown heat labile bacterial metabolites, not by a reduction in CDM components that decrease glucose uptake. Supernatants prepared after anaerobic culture of L. gasseri, L. amylovorus, L. gallinarum, and L. johnsonii in the CDM with fructose increased glucose accumulation by 83%, 32%, 27%, and 14%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The rapid, non-genomic upregulation of SGLT1 by bacterial metabolites is a heretofore unrecognized interaction between probiotics and the intestinal epithelium.

Title:Compartmentalized cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate at the plasma membrane clusters PDE3A and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator into microdomains.

Abstract:Formation of multiple-protein macromolecular complexes at specialized subcellular microdomains increases the specificity and efficiency of signaling in cells. In this study, we demonstrate that phosphodiesterase type 3A (PDE3A) physically and functionally interacts with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel. PDE3A inhibition generates compartmentalized cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), which further clusters PDE3A and CFTR into microdomains at the plasma membrane and potentiates CFTR channel function. Actin skeleton disruption reduces PDE3A-CFTR interaction and segregates PDE3A from its interacting partners, thus compromising the integrity of the CFTR-PDE3A-containing macromolecular complex. Consequently, compartmentalized cAMP signaling is lost. PDE3A inhibition no longer activates CFTR channel function in a compartmentalized manner. The physiological relevance of PDE3A-CFTR interaction was investigated using pig trachea submucosal gland secretion model. Our data show that PDE3A inhibition augments CFTR-dependent submucosal gland secretion and actin skeleton disruption decreases secretion.

Abstract:Minimally invasive subdermal injection of liquid silicone has been used clinically to augment the soft tissue of the foot to mitigate high pressures that cause diabetic foot ulcers. However, implant migration has been a clinical issue. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of three specific concentrations of silicone resin particles (12 mum average diameter) in conjunction with either platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on fibroblast cell proliferation, collagen synthesis, cell morphology, and migration through in vitro assays and a monolayer scratch wound model. PDGF and bFGF enhanced the proliferation of fibroblasts 5.7-fold and fivefold, respectively, while the addition of silicone particles had no significant effect on proliferation. Collagen production was increased approximately twofold with the addition of bFGF and the medium concentration of particles over bFGF without particles and the PDGF groups. The addition of silicone particles had no significant effect on collagen production compared with control groups without particles. Fibroblast migration was enhanced by the addition of both PDGF and bFGF compared to controls, although slower scratch wound closure rates were observed in the presence of particles compared to controls without particles. Cell morphology suggested that particles induced cellular aggregation encircling silicone particles postwounding as well as migration into the wound area. These results suggest that silicone particles in combination with a growth factor might enhance fibroblast aggregation and implant stability, and could promote connective tissue ingrowth and implant encapsulation in the soft tissue of the diabetic foot.

Title:Dissipative particle dynamics simulation of the interplay between spinodal decomposition and wetting in thin film binary fluids.
Authors:['Hore MJ', 'Laradji M']
Affiliation:Department of Physics, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:The dynamics of phase separation of thin film binary fluids is investigated via dissipative particle dynamics simulation. We consider both cases of symmetric and asymmetric interactions between the walls and the two components. In the case of walls interacting symmetrically with the two fluid components, corresponding to a nonwetting case, relatively fast kinetics is observed when the average domain size is smaller than the slit thickness. A crossover to a slow Lifshitz-Slyozov growth is observed at late times. Faster dynamics is observed when the walls act as a slip boundary condition to the velocity field. In the case of asymmetric interactions, such that the system is in the wetting regime, the interplay between wetting kinetics and spinodal decomposition leads to rich dynamics. The phase separation proceeds through three stages. During the first stage, the dynamics is characterized as surface-directed spinodal decomposition, with growth of both average domain size and thickness of the wetting layers. The domain morphology is three dimensional and bicontinuous during the first stage, with kinetics reminiscent of that in bulk systems is observed. The second stage of the phase separation is characterized by the breakup of the bicontinuous domain morphology into small tubular domains bridging the two wetting layers and depletion of the core of the film from the wetting component. During this stage, domains with diameter smaller than thickness of the film shrink and disappear while those with diameter larger that the film thickness grow. The third stage is characterized by growth induced by the backflow of A-component from the wetting layers to the core of the film, leading to the decay in the thickness of the film and growth of the domains bridging the wetting layers. At even later times of the third stage, when the wetting layers become very depleted in the wetting component, growth becomes mediated by diffusion followed by collision of the tubular domains.

Title:Emotion regulation as a mediator of the relation between emotion socialization and deliberate self-harm.
Authors:['Buckholdt KE', 'Parra GR', 'Jobe-Shields L']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. kbckhldt@memphis.edu
Abstract:This study examined (a) whether retrospective reports of specific parent responses to sadness (i.e., reward, punishment, neglect, override, magnification) were related to deliberate self-harm (DSH) and (b) whether difficulties regulating emotions (i.e., difficulties monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotions) mediated those relations. One hundred eighteen college students completed measures of parental emotion socialization, emotion regulation difficulties, and DSH. Parental reward and override of sadness were directly related to lower DSH scores. Parental punishment and neglect of sadness were related to higher DSH scores, and these associations were mediated by difficulties evaluating emotions. In other words, parental punishment and neglect of sadness may place individuals at risk for DSH by fostering negative evaluations of emotional experiences and the belief that nothing can be done to effectively manage emotions.

Title:VCP/p97 is essential for maturation of ubiquitin-containing autophagosomes and this function is impaired by mutations that cause IBMPFD.

Abstract:VCP (VCP/p97) is a ubiquitously expressed member of the AAA(+)-ATPase family of chaperone-like proteins that regulates numerous cellular processes including chromatin decondensation, homotypic membrane fusion and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation by the proteasome. Mutations in VCP cause a multisystem degenerative disease consisting of inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease of bone, and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). Here we show that VCP is essential for autophagosome maturation. We generated cells stably expressing dual-tagged LC3 (mCherry-EGFP-LC3) which permit monitoring of autophagosome maturation. We determined that VCP deficiency by RNAi-mediated knockdown or overexpression of dominant-negative VCP results in significant accumulation of immature autophagic vesicles, some of which are abnormally large, acidified and exhibit cathepsin B activity. Furthermore, expression of disease-associated VCP mutants (R155H and A232E) also causes this autophagy defect. VCP was found to be essential to autophagosome maturation under basal conditions and in cells challenged by proteasome inhibition, but not in cells challenged by starvation, suggesting that VCP might be selectively required for autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated substrates. Indeed, a high percentage of the accumulated autophagic vesicles contain ubiquitin-positive contents, a feature that is not observed in autophagic vesicles that accumulate following starvation or treatment with Bafilomycin A. Finally, we show accumulation of numerous, large LAMP-1 and LAMP-2-positive vacuoles and accumulation of LC3-II in myoblasts derived from patients with IBMPFD. We conclude that VCP is essential for maturation of ubiquitin-containing autophagosomes and that defect in this function may contribute to IBMPFD pathogenesis.

Abstract:Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol abuse both are negatively associated with health, and alcohol misuse may mediate the relationship between PTSD and functional health outcomes. The present study tested for such mediation using self-report measures of PTSD symptoms, hazardous alcohol use, and health functioning in 151 U.S. veterans (136 men and 15 women) of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan recruited from a Veterans Affairs primary care clinic. Based on established cut scores, 39.1% screened positive for PTSD and 26.5% screened positive for hazardous drinking. PTSD symptoms and hazardous drinking were significantly correlated with each other and with health functioning. Hazardous drinking was found to partially mediate the relationship between PTSD and functional mental health, but not physical health.

Title:Stability of RNA structural motifs and its influence on editing efficiency by adenosine deaminases.
Authors:['Phan V', 'Thomas A', 'Malasri K', 'Sutter CH']
Affiliation:Department of Computer Science, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. vphan@memphis.edu
Abstract:We propose a novel method to estimate editing efficiency by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs). The method employs the notion of stability of secondary structure in the vicinity of edited sites during transcription. Such an analysis of 'dynamic' structural motifs of RNA is important because as a pre-spliced RNA is being transcribed and elongated, its entire structure, and thus its local structures, may change drastically. Our simulation showed that the stability of structures in the vicinity of edited sites correlates moderately highly with editing efficiency of edited sites recently established in laboratory experiments.

Abstract:Pathogen-induced modifications in host behavior, including alterations in foraging behavior or foraging efficiency, can compromise host fitness by reducing growth and development. Chytridiomycosis is an infectious disease of amphibians caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and it has played an important role in the worldwide decline of amphibians. In larval anurans, Bd infections commonly result in reduced developmental rates, however, the mechanism(s) responsible are untested. We conducted laboratory experiments to test whether Bd infections reduced foraging performance of Grey Treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) and Fowler's Toad (Anaxyrus [= Bufo] fowleri) tadpoles. In the first experiment, we observed foraging behavior of Bd-infected and uninfected tadpoles to test for differences in foraging activity. In a second experiment, we tested for differences in the ingestion rates of tadpoles by examining the amount of food in their alimentary track after a 3-hour foraging period. We hypothesized that Bd-infected tadpoles would forage less often and less efficiently than uninfected tadpoles. As predicted, Bd-infected larvae forage less often and were less efficient at obtaining food than uninfected larvae. Our results show that Bd infections reduce foraging efficiency in Anaxyrus and Hyla tadpoles, and that Bd differentially affects foraging behavior in these species. Thus, our results provide a potential mechanism of decreased developmental rates of Bd-infected tadpoles.

Title:Transgenic mice expressing mutant forms VCP/p97 recapitulate the full spectrum of IBMPFD including degeneration in muscle, brain and bone.

Abstract:Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is a dominantly inherited degenerative disorder caused by mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene. VCP (p97 in mouse, TER94 in Drosophila melanogaster and CDC48 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is a highly conserved AAA(+)-ATPase that regulates a wide array of cellular processes. The mechanism of IBMPFD pathogenesis is unknown. Towards elucidating the pathogenic mechanism we have developed and characterized transgenic mice with ubiquitous expression of wild-type and disease-causing versions of human VCP/p97. Here, we report that mice expressing VCP/p97 harboring the mutations R155H or A232E develop pathology that is limited to muscle, brain and bone, recapitulating the spectrum of disease in humans with IBMPFD. The mice exhibit progressive muscle weakness and pathological examination of muscle shows classic characteristics of inclusion body myopathy including rimmed vacuoles and TDP-43 pathology. The mice exhibit abnormalities in behavioral testing and pathological examination of the brain shows widespread TDP-43 pathology. Furthermore, radiological examination of the skeleton reveals that mutant mice develop severe osteopenia accompanied by focal lytic and sclerotic lesions in vertebrae and femur. In vitro studies indicate that mutant VCP causes inappropriate activation of the NF-kappaB signaling cascade, which could contribute to the mechanism of pathogenesis in multiple tissues including muscle, bone and brain.

Title:Tonic ubiquitylation controls T-cell receptor:CD3 complex expression during T-cell development.

Abstract:Expression of the T-cell receptor (TCR):CD3 complex is tightly regulated during T-cell development. The mechanism and physiological role of this regulation are unclear. Here, we show that the TCR:CD3 complex is constitutively ubiquitylated in immature double positive (DP) thymocytes, but not mature single positive (SP) thymocytes or splenic T cells. This steady state, tonic CD3 monoubiquitylation is mediated by the CD3varepsilon proline-rich sequence, Lck, c-Cbl, and SLAP, which collectively trigger the dynamin-dependent downmodulation, lysosomal sequestration and degradation of surface TCR:CD3 complexes. Blocking this tonic ubiquitylation by mutating all the lysines in the CD3 cytoplasmic tails significantly upregulates TCR levels on DP thymocytes. Mimicking monoubiquitylation by expression of a CD3zeta-monoubiquitin (monoUb) fusion molecule significantly reduces TCR levels on immature thymocytes. Moreover, modulating CD3 ubiquitylation alters immunological synapse (IS) formation and Erk phosphorylation, thereby shifting the signalling threshold for positive and negative selection, and regulatory T-cell development. Thus, tonic TCR:CD3 ubiquitylation results in precise regulation of TCR expression on immature T cells, which is required to maintain the fidelity of T-cell development.

Abstract:INTRODUCTION: Previous research has suggested that childhood cancer survivors initiate smoking at rates approaching those of healthy individuals, even though smoking presents unique risks to survivors. The present study explores whether the attentional and executive functioning (EF) deficits associated with cancer and treatment place survivors of childhood cancer at increased risk for smoking. METHODS: Data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study were examined to identify concurrent and longitudinal correlates of tobacco use. We explored whether childhood attention problems and adulthood executive dysfunction were associated with smoking among adult survivors of childhood cancer. RESULTS: Childhood attention problems emerged as a striking predictor of adult smoking nearly a decade later on average. Nearly half (40.4%) of survivors who experienced attention problems in childhood reported a history of smoking, a significantly higher rate of ever smoking, than reported by those without childhood attention problems (relative risk [RR] = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.31-1.79). Furthermore, they were nearly twice as likely to be current smokers in adulthood compared with those without childhood attention problems (RR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.38-2.11). Similar associations were found between components of adult executive dysfunction and adult smoking. DISCUSSION: Childhood cancer and treatment are associated with subsequent deficits in attention and EF. Early detection of these deficits will allow clinicians to identify patients who are at increased risk for smoking, an important step in promoting and maintaining health in this medically vulnerable population.

Abstract:Opportunities to investigate selection in free-living species during a naturally occurring epidemic are rare; however, we assessed innate immunocompetence in Florida scrub-jays before the population suffered the greatest over-winter mortality in 20 years of study. Propitiously, three months prior to the epidemic, we had sampled a number of male breeders to evaluate a suite of physiological measures that are commonly used to estimate the overall health-state of an individual. There was a significant, positive selection gradient for both Escherichia coli bacterial killing capability and body condition, suggesting that directional selection had occurred upon each of these traits during the disease epidemic.

Title:Short and long compression release times: speech understanding, real-world preferences, and association with cognitive ability.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Xu J']
Affiliation:School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, University of Memphis, TN 38105, USA. robyncox@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Several previous investigations have explored the relationship between cognitive abilities and speech understanding with short and long hearing aid compression release times in adult hearing aid wearers. Although there was consensus that such a relationship exists, the details have not been consistent across studies. This investigation was designed to further explore, extend, and generalize this topic. PURPOSE: Questions addressed: (1) the association between cognitive abilities and speech understanding with short and long release times for more ecologically valid speech than in previous studies, (2) the presence or absence of release time preferences in daily life, and (3) the association between the laboratory measures and real-world release time preferences. RESEARCH DESIGN: The study was a blinded randomized crossover trial. STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-four subjects with mean age of 72yr completed the study. They were experienced users of bilateral amplification with mild to moderately-severe symmetrical hearing losses. They were healthy, English-speaking active seniors recruited using advertisements and letters. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: There were five test sessions. They included audiometric and cognitive testing, fitting bilateral Oticon Adapto hearing aids, a four-week trial with either short or long release time, outcome measures, a four-week trial with the other release time, further outcome measures, and a final interview. RESULTS: Taken together with the previous studies, the results suggest that compression processing release time is more critical for patients with lower cognitive abilities than for those with higher cognitive abilities. Further, we postulate that the best release time for listeners with lower cognitive abilities depends on the redundancy of the tested speech. Those with lower cognitive abilities might benefit from short release time when contextual speech is used, or when speech is rich in context, release time might not be important; however, when speech is low in semantic context, listeners with lower cognitive abilities might require long release time for best performance. Listeners do appear to be able to distinguish between long and short release time processing in daily life listening. However, release time preference was not predictable from cognitive abilities or aided measures of speech understanding. About two-thirds preferred long release time, and one-third preferred short release time. CONCLUSION: The relationship between cognitive abilities and performance with short and long release time processing was supported and further elucidated in this research. In addition, release time was seen to be a salient variable in subjective performance with amplification in daily life. Accurate prospective prescription of release time has the potential to make a material contribution to successful amplification provision.

Abstract:We report here the development of a chitosan/beta-glycerophosphate(Ch/beta-GP) thermo-sensitive gel to deliver ellagic acid (EA) for cancer treatment. The properties of the Ch/beta-GP gels were characterized regarding chemical structure, surface morphology, and viscoelasticity. In vitro EA release rate from the EA loaded Ch/beta-GP gel and chitosan degradation rate were investigated. The anti-tumor effect of the EA loaded Ch/beta-GP gel on brain cancer cells (human U87 glioblastomas and rat C6 glioma cells) was evaluated by examining cell viability. Cell number and activity were monitored by the MTS assay. The Ch/beta-GP solution formed a heat-induced gel at body temperature, and the gelation temperature and time were affected by the final pH of the Ch/beta-GP solution. The lysozyme increased the EA release rate by 2.5 times higher than that in the absence of lysozyme. Dialyzed chitosan solution with final pH 6.3 greatly reduced the beta-GP needed for gelation, thereby significantly improving the biocompatibility of gel (p < 0.001). The chitosan gels containing 1% (w/v) of ellagic acid significantly reduced viability of U87 cells and C6 cells compared with the chitosan gels at 3 days incubation (p < 0.01, and p < 0.001, respectively).

Title:Emotion dysregulation as a mechanism through which parental magnification of sadness increases risk for binge eating and limited control of eating behaviors.

Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, United States. kbckhldt@memphis.edu
Abstract:The present study examined whether emotion dysregulation mediates the relation between parent responses to emotion and disordered eating behaviors (e.g., binge eating and compensatory actions). One hundred eighteen college students (48% racial/ethnic minority; mean age=21) reported on their current difficulties regulating emotions, current disordered eating behaviors, and perceptions of their parents' responses to their emotions when they were growing up. Five parental response types to two emotions and three types of disordered eating behaviors (i.e., binge eating, compensatory actions, and lack of control) were assessed. Difficulties regulating emotion partially mediated the relation of parental magnification of sadness (i.e., matching with greater intensity) to binge eating and limited control of eating behaviors. This study identified a specific parenting practice which may contribute to the development of disordered eating behaviors and a potential mechanism to explain this relation. These findings also highlight family emotion-related processes as important for better understanding disordered eating behaviors.

Title:An Approach for determining antibiotic loading for a physician-directed antibiotic-loaded PMMA bone cement formulation.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Brooks JL', 'Courtney HS', 'Li Y', 'Haggard WO']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: When a physician-directed antibiotic-loaded polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement (ALBC) formulation is used in total hip arthroplasties (THAs) and total knee arthroplasties (TKAs), current practice in the United States involves arbitrary choice of the antibiotic loading (herein defined as the ratio of the mass of the antibiotic added to the mass of the cement powder). We suggest there is a need to develop a rational method for determining this loading. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We propose a new method for determining the antibiotic loading to use when preparing a physician-directed ALBC formulation and illustrate this method using three in vitro properties of an ALBC in which the antibiotic was daptomycin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Daptomycin was blended with the powder of the cement using a mechanical mixer. We performed fatigue, elution, and activity tests on three sets of specimens having daptomycin loadings of 2.25, 4.50, and 11.00 wt/wt%. Correlational analyses of the results of these tests were used in conjunction with stated constraints and a nonlinear optimization method to determine the daptomycin loading to use. RESULTS: With an increase in daptomycin loading, the estimated mean fatigue limit of the cement decreased, the estimated elution rate of the antibiotic increased, and the percentage inhibition of staphylococcal growth by the eluate remained unchanged at 100%. For a daptomycin-loaded PMMA bone cement we computed the optimum amount of daptomycin to mechanically blend with 40 g of cement powder is 1.36 g. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest an approach that may be used to determine the amount of antibiotic to blend with the powder of a PMMA bone cement when preparing a physician-directed ALBC formulation, and highlighted the attractions and limitations of this approach. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: When a physician-directed ALBC formulation is selected for use in a TKA or THA, the approach we detail may be employed to determine the antibiotic loading to use rather than the empirical approach that is taken in current clinical practice.

Title:Nicotine self-administration differentially modulates glutamate and GABA transmission in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus to enhance the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response to stress.
Authors:['Yu G', 'Chen H', 'Wu X', 'Matta SG', 'Sharp BM']
Affiliation:Department of Pharmacology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.
Abstract:The mechanisms by which chronic nicotine self-administration augments hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) responses to stress are only partially understood. Nicotine self-administration alters neuropeptide expression in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons within paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and increases PVN responsiveness to norepinephrine during mild footshock stress. Glutamate and GABA also modulate CRF neurons, but their roles in enhanced HPA responsiveness to footshock during chronic self-administration are unknown. We show that nicotine self-administration augmented footshock-induced PVN glutamate release, but further decreased GABA release. In these rats, intra-PVN kynurenic acid, a glutamate receptor antagonist, blocked enhanced adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone responses to footshock. In contrast, peri-PVN kynurenic acid, which decreases activity of GABA afferents to PVN, enhanced footshock-induced corticosterone secretion only in control rats self-administering saline. Additionally, in rats self-administering nicotine, footshock-induced elevation of corticosterone was significantly less than in controls after intra-PVN saclofen (GABA-B receptor antagonist). Therefore, the exaggerated reduction in GABA release by footshock during nicotine self-administration disinhibits CRF neurons. This disinhibition combined with enhanced glutamate input provides a new mechanism for HPA sensitization to stress by chronic nicotine self-administration. This mechanism, which does not preserve homeostatic plasticity, supports the concept that smoking functions as a chronic stressor that sensitizes the HPA to stress.

Affiliation:Department of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of glycine propionyl-L-carnitine (GPLC) to decrease lipid peroxidation, elevate nitric oxide, and improve blood lipid profiles in human subjects. METHODS: Thirty untrained, normolipidemic subjects performed eight weeks of supervised aerobic exercise while supplementing GPLC at one of two doses (1 or 3 grams daily of PLC + glycine) or placebo, following random assignment in a double-blind manner. Fasting blood samples were analyzed at rest for malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and lipids before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Malondialdehyde was decreased (p<0.05) from pre- to post-intervention with 1 g GPLC (1.08+/-0.24 vs. 0.69+/-0.25 micromol.L (-1)) and 3 g GPLC (0.94+/-0.18 vs. 0.66+/-0.17 micromol.L (-1)), but did not change statistically (p>0.05) with placebo (1.12+/-0.21 vs. 1.03+/-0.23 micromol.L (-1)). Nitric oxide was increased (p<0.05) from pre- to post-intervention with 3 g GPLC (21.34+/-2.27 vs. 29.46+/-3.61 micromol.L (-1)), but did not change statistically (p>0.05) with 1 g GPLC (23.22+/-4.13 vs. 26.24+/-4.32 micromol.L (-1)) or placebo (24.31+/-3.90 vs. 26.14+/-4.11 micromol.L (-1)). No main effects or interaction effects were noted for blood lipids (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: GPLC supplementation combined with eight weeks of aerobic exercise decreases lipid peroxidation and elevates nitric oxide, but does not further improve blood lipid profiles in normolipidemic subjects.

Title:Performance, properties and plasticity of identified oxytocin and vasopressin neurones in vitro.

Affiliation:Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA. warmstrong@uthsc.edu
Abstract:The neurohypophysial hormones oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (VP) originate from hypothalamic neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular and supraoptic (SON) nuclei. The firing rate and pattern of action potentials arising from these neurones determine the timing and quantity of peripheral hormone release. We have used immunochemical identification of biocytin-filled SON neurones in hypothalamic slices in vitro to uncover differences between OT and VP neurones in membrane and synaptic properties, firing patterns, and plasticity during pregnancy and lactation. In this review, we summarise some recent findings from this approach: (i) VP neuronal excitability is influenced by slow (sDAP) and fast (fDAP) depolarising afterpotentials that underlie phasic bursting activity. The fDAP may relate to a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel, type melastatin (TRPM4 and/or TRPM5), both of which are immunochemically localised more to VP neurones, and especially, to their dendrites. Both TRPM4 and TRPM5 mRNAs are found in the SON, but single cell reverse transcriptase-polymerisation suggests that TRPM4 might be the more prominent channel. Phasic bursting in VP neurones is little influenced by spontaneous synaptic activity in slices, being shaped largely by intrinsic currents. (ii) The firing pattern of OT neurones ranges from irregular to continuous, with the coefficient of variation determined by randomly distributed, spontaneous GABAergic, inhibitory synaptic currents (sIPSCs). These sIPSCs are four- to five-fold more frequent in OT versus VP neurones, and much more frequent than spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents. (iii) Both cell types express Ca(2+)-dependent afterhyperpolarisations (AHPs), including an apamin-sensitive, medium duration AHP and a slower, apamin-insensitive AHP (sAHP). In OT neurones, both AHPs are enhanced during pregnancy and lactation. During pregnancy, the plasticity of the sAHP is blocked by antagonism of central OT receptors. AHP enhancement is mimicked by exposing slices from day 19 pregnant rats to OT and oestradiol, suggesting that central OT and sex steroids programme this plasticity during pregnancy by direct hypothalamic actions. In conclusion, the differences in VP and OT neuronal function are underlain by differences in both membrane and synaptic properties, and differentially modulated by reproductive state.

Abstract:A detailed three-dimensional solid model of the full cervical spine (C1-C7 levels) and the finite element analysis method were used to investigate the extent of changes in various biomechanical properties brought about when surgical methods are used to treat condition(s) caused by or are a sequela of disc degeneration disease at the C5-C6 level. The surgical methods simulated were anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, with interbody fusion achieved using a notional brick-shaped graft only; anterior cervical discectomy alone; percutaneous nucleotomy; and three variants of nucleus replacement. The control case was a model of an intact, healthy, adult spine. Each of these seven models was subjected to (1) flexion moment, extension moment, left lateral bending moment, right lateral bending moment, clockwise-acting axial rotation moment, and counterclockwise-acting axial rotation moment, with a compression pre-load applied simultaneously with each of these loadings and (2) an axial compression force (applied as a uniform pressure) only. For each combination of model and applied loading, the maximum von Mises stress and the maximum strain energy density were determined for tissues at the treated level, at one level above the treated level, and at one level below the treated level and (2) the total principal rotation angles at each of the intersegmental positions of the entire model. In addition, for each of the study cases, we obtained the longitudinal displacement of each of the models when subjected to the axial compression force only. We found markedly fewer changes (relative to the results when the intact, healthy spine model was used) in each of the above-mentioned biomechanical parameters above a specified threshold in the case of the simulated percutaneous nucleotomy and simulated nucleus replacement models, on one hand, compared to the simulated fusion and simulated discectomy models, on the other. This finding is in consonance with the evolving clinical practice of using minimally invasive surgical methods for treating problem(s) such as soft cervical disc herniations.

Abstract:A pseudo-testcross pedigree is widely used for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in outcrossing species, but the model for analyzing pseudo-testcross data borrowed from the inbred backcross design can only detect those QTLs that are heterozygous only in one parent. In this study, an intercross model that incorporates the high heterozygosity and phase uncertainty of outcrossing species was used to reanalyze a published data set on QTL mapping in poplar trees. Several intercross QTLs that are heterozygous in both parents were detected, which are responsible not only for biomass traits, but also for their genetic correlations. This study provides a more complete identification of QTLs responsible for economically important biomass traits in poplars.

Title:Disparities in sleep position awareness and compliance.
Authors:['Zachry AH', 'Kitzmann KM']
Affiliation:Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology and Research, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. annezachry@gmail.com
Abstract:OBJECTIVES: To identify demographic predictors of caregivers who are more likely to position their infants prone for sleep; to determine caregivers' primary information sources regarding sleep position recommendations; and to determine the primary influence on choice of infant sleep position among caregivers who still place their infants in an at-risk sleep position when informed of the recommendations. METHODS: Survey of caregivers of 205 infants from birth to 24 months at 2 rural and 2 urban private pediatric practices in Southwest Tennessee. RESULTS: Income was a significant predictor (P < 0.05) of caregivers' awareness of sleep position recommendations. Awareness rates were 74% among respondents with an income of less than $20,000 and 98% among those earning above $80,000. The primary source of sleep position recommendations for lower income and African American respondents was hospital staff; higher income and European Americans reported printed materials as the primary source. Among respondents who were aware of the recommendations but noncompliant, 60% reported infant preference as the primary influence on choice of sleep position. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, particular emphasis needs to be placed on reaching out to lower income groups to disseminate the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) sleep positioning recommendations. The importance of positioning infants supine for sleep must be stressed before mother and baby are discharged from the hospital. Caregivers need to understand that many infants prefer to sleep on their stomachs, but there are ways to help babies adapt to supine sleeping.

Title:Strategies to read and learn: overcoming learning by consumption.
Authors:['McNamara DS']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. dsmcnamara1@gmail.com
Abstract:OBJECTIVES: This article discusses the need for, and value of, providing students with instruction in how to use comprehension strategies as well as the effectiveness of inducing strategy use through cognitive disequilibrium. The leading assumption that guides this article is that learning facts and figures is not enough. Students need to build deep knowledge that is interconnected, coherent and includes understanding of potential causal mechanisms. Doing so requires going beyond the printed page by generating inferences and developing coherent explanations. Inferences and explanations allow the student to make links between concepts in the material and, importantly, to make connections to prior knowledge. These connections render students' understanding of new material more coherent and, in consequence, deeper and more stable. DISCUSSION: This article describes two means of inducing students to construct a deeper understanding of new material. One means of challenging students is through cohesion gaps in a text (or a lecture) that require the student to generate inferences to understand the relationships between concepts. Although low-knowledge readers are not able to generate these inferences, relatively high-knowledge readers (e.g. medical students) are more likely to successfully generate inferences to bridge conceptual gaps, and doing so results in a deeper understanding of the material. A second means of inducing active processing is to provide students with instruction and practice in how to use comprehension strategies. This article describes methods of providing such instruction, including the intelligent tutoring system, iSTART. CONCLUSIONS: The overarching goal of the research described in this article is to scaffold students towards ideal learning strategies. This cannot happen simply by telling students about good strategies. It is ineffective to inform a student that the content will be better understood if it is explained or evaluated. Such an approach is a victim of learning by consumption attitudes towards education.

Title:Predicting violence in romantic relationships during adolescence and emerging adulthood: a critical review of the mechanisms by which familial and peer influences operate.
Authors:['Olsen JP', 'Parra GR', 'Bennett SA']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Department of Psychology, 202 Psychology Bldg., Memphis, TN 38152, USA. jolsen@memphis.edu
Abstract:For three decades, researchers have sought to gain a greater understanding of the developmental antecedents to later perpetration or victimization of violence in romantic relationships. Whereas the majority of early studies focused on family-of-origin factors, attention in recent years has turned to additional ecologies such as peer relationships. This review highlights accomplishments of both family and peer studies that focus on violent romantic relationships in an effort to summarize the current state of knowledge. Attention is given to epidemiology and developmental family and peer factors, with special attention given to mechanisms that mediate and/or moderate the relation between family and peer factors and later participation in violent relationships. A critical approach is taken throughout the review in order to identify limitations of previous studies, and to highlight key findings. A case is made for viewing these developmental antecedents as a result of multiple developmental ecologies that is perhaps best summarized as a culture of violence.

Title:Determination of vitellogenin titer in the hemolymph of Dermacentor variabilis (Acarina: Ixodidae) using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Authors:['Rosell R', 'Coons LB']
Affiliation:Biology Department, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:Using polyclonal antibodies against Dermacentor variabilis (Say) egg vitellin, we developed an indirect, competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Vitellogenin in the hemolymph of females was quantitatively monitored through feeding (slow feeding and rapid engorgement feeding periods) and postfeeding (preoviposition and oviposition) until death. Vitellogenin concentrations in hemolymph ranged from 1 microgram/ml on the first day of feeding to a maximum of 430 micrograms/ml on the third day of oviposition. The temporal pattern of vitellogenin production in this tick shows a gradual increase in the hemolymph vitellogenin titer throughout the slow feeding period followed by a rapid and substantial rise during the rapid engorgement feeding period and a continuation of this rise in titer through the most productive egg laying part of oviposition. The vitellogenin titer rapidly falls toward the end of oviposition as the tick nears death. There was a 170-fold increase in vitellogenin concentration as measured from the onset of rapid engorgement to the maximum vitellogenin titer. The rapid engorgement feeding period signaled a sharp increase in vitellogenin production.

Title:Pharmacophore development and application toward the identification of novel, small-molecule autotaxin inhibitors.
Authors:['North EJ', 'Howard AL', 'Wanjala IW', 'Pham TC', 'Baker DL', 'Parrill AL']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted glycoprotein with lysophospholipase D (LPLD) activity that generates the bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). Both ATX and LPA have been linked to the promotion and progression of cancer as well as cardiovascular disease and obesity. Despite the fact that ATX inhibitors have the potential to be useful chemotherapeutics for multiple indications, few examples of potent ATX inhibitors are described in the current literature. Here we describe the development of pharmacophore models for the inhibition of ATX by nonlipids and apply these tools to the discovery of additional ATX inhibitors using the NCI open chemical repository database. From this database of > 250,000 compounds, 168 candidate inhibitors were identified. Of these candidates, 106 were available for testing and 33 were identified as active (those that inhibited ATX activity by > or =50% at a single 10 microM concentration), a 31% hit rate. Five of these compounds had IC(50) < 1.5 microM and the most potent compound possessed a K(i) of 271 nM.

Title:Chitosan sponges to locally deliver amikacin and vancomycin: a pilot in vitro evaluation.
Authors:['Noel SP', 'Courtney HS', 'Bumgardner JD', 'Haggard WO']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Open orthopaedic wounds are ideal sites for infection. Preventing infection in these wounds is critical for reducing patient morbidity and mortality, controlling antimicrobial resistance and lowering the cost of treatment. Localized drug delivery has the potential to overcome the challenges associated with traditional systemic dosing. A degradable, biocompatible polymer sponge (chitosan) that can be loaded with clinician-selected antibiotics at the point of care would provide the patient and clinician with a desirable, adjunctive preventive modality. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked (1) if an adaptable, porous chitosan matrix could absorb and elute antibiotics for 72 hours for potential use as an adjunctive therapy to debridement and lavage; and (2) if the sponges could elute levels of antibiotic that would inhibit growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa? METHODS: We fabricated a degradable chitosan sponge that can be loaded with antibiotics during a 60-second hydration in drug-containing solution. In vitro evaluation determined amikacin and vancomycin release from chitosan sponges at six time points. Activity tests were used to assess the release of inhibitory levels of amikacin and vancomycin. RESULTS: Amikacin concentration was 881.5 microg/mL after 1 hour with a gradual decline to 13.9 microg/mL after 72 hours. Vancomycin concentration was 1007.4 microg/mL after 1 hour with a decrease to 48.1 microg/mL after 72 hours. Zone of inhibition tests were used to verify inhibitory levels of drug release from chitosan sponges. A turbidity assay testing activity of released amikacin and vancomycin indicated inhibitory levels of elution from the chitosan sponge. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Chitosan sponges may provide a potential local drug delivery device for preventing musculoskeletal infections.

Title:Large-scale pose-invariant face recognition using cellular simultaneous recurrent network.
Authors:['Ren Y', 'Iftekharuddin KM', 'White WE']
Affiliation:Intelligent Systems and Image Processing Lab, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:In this work, we propose a novel technique for face recognition with +/-90 degrees pose variations in image sequences using a cellular simultaneous recurrent network (CSRN). We formulate the recognition problem with such large-pose variations as an implicit temporal prediction task for CSRN. We exploit a face extraction algorithm based on the scale-space method and facial structural knowledge as a preprocessing step. Further, to reduce computational cost, we obtain eigenfaces for a set of image sequences for each person and use these reduced pattern vectors as the input to CSRN. CSRN learns how to associate each face class/person in the training phase. A modified distance metric between successive frames of test and training output pattern vectors indicate either a match or mismatch between the two corresponding face classes. We extensively evaluate our CSRN-based face recognition technique using the publicly available VidTIMIT Audio-Video face dataset. Our simulation shows that for this dataset with large-scale pose variations, we can obtain an overall 77% face recognition rate.

Title:The nuclear hormone receptor Coup-TFII is required for the initiation and early maintenance of Prox1 expression in lymphatic endothelial cells.

Abstract:The homeobox gene Prox1 is crucial for mammalian lymphatic vascular development. In the absence of Prox1, lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are not specified. The maintenance of LEC identity also requires the constant expression of Prox1. However, the mechanisms controlling the expression of this gene in LECs remain poorly understood. The SRY-related gene Sox18 is required to induce Prox1 expression in venous LEC progenitors. Although Sox18 is also expressed in embryonic arteries, these vessels do not express Prox1, nor do they give rise to LECs. This finding suggests that some venous endothelial cell-specific factor is required for the activation of Prox1. Here we demonstrate that the nuclear hormone receptor Coup-TFII is necessary for the activation of Prox1 in embryonic veins by directly binding a conserved DNA domain in the regulatory region of Prox1. In addition, we show that the direct interaction between nuclear hormone receptors and Prox1 is also necessary for the maintenance of Prox1 expression during early stages of LEC specification and differentiation.

Abstract:The anti-Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) myristoylated-peptide (M.W. 916.2Da) is a natural product isolated from Heliothis virescens insect larval hemolymph (blood) that essentially has no cytotoxicity against human foreskin fibroblast cells. A (3 methyl only) version (M.W. 902.2 Da) of the structure was synthesized and tested for in vitro anti-EBV activity and cytotoxicity. The N-terminal end is lipophilic and used to get the compound across the cell membrane. The C-terminal end with its ring-shaped structures is likely used to inhibit DNA synthesis. The synthetic compound inhibited DNA synthesis/replication of EBV in Akata cells (B-lymphocyte from Burkitt's lymphoma patient) in in vitro tissue culture. A DNA hybridization assay for anti-EBV activity using the Akata B-cell and two cytotoxicity assays using human foreskin fibroblast cells were done with the synthetic peptide. Effective concentration (EC90) at 20 microM inhibited viral replication by 90%. The EBV, known as Human Herpesvirus-4 (HHV-4) of the Herpesviridae family, has been described as a cancer-promoting double-stranded DNA virus that may also be involved in autoimmune disease. There are no antiviral drugs in clinical use for diseases caused by the EBV.

Abstract:Acoustic analysis of infant vocalizations has typically employed traditional acoustic measures drawn from adult speech acoustics, such as f(0), duration, formant frequencies, amplitude, and pitch perturbation. Here an alternative and complementary method is proposed in which data-derived spectrographic features are central. 1-s-long spectrograms of vocalizations produced by six infants recorded longitudinally between ages 3 and 11 months are analyzed using a neural network consisting of a self-organizing map and a single-layer perceptron. The self-organizing map acquires a set of holistic, data-derived spectrographic receptive fields. The single-layer perceptron receives self-organizing map activations as input and is trained to classify utterances into prelinguistic phonatory categories (squeal, vocant, or growl), identify the ages at which they were produced, and identify the individuals who produced them. Classification performance was significantly better than chance for all three classification tasks. Performance is compared to another popular architecture, the fully supervised multilayer perceptron. In addition, the network's weights and patterns of activation are explored from several angles, for example, through traditional acoustic measurements of the network's receptive fields. Results support the use of this and related tools for deriving holistic acoustic features directly from infant vocalization data and for the automatic classification of infant vocalizations.

Title:Acetylcholine-dopamine interactions in the pathophysiology and treatment of CNS disorders.
Authors:['Lester DB', 'Rogers TD', 'Blaha CD']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area of the midbrain form the nigrostriatal and mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic pathways that, respectively, project to dorsal and ventral striatum (including prefrontal cortex). These midbrain dopaminergic nuclei and their respective forebrain and cortical target areas are well established as serving a critical role in mediating voluntary motor control, as evidenced in Parkinson's disease, and incentive-motivated behaviors and cognitive functions, as exhibited in drug addiction and schizophrenia, respectively. Although it cannot be disputed that excitatory and inhibitory amino acid-based neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and GABA, play a vital role in modulating activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, recent evidence suggests that acetylcholine may be as important in regulating dopaminergic transmission. Midbrain dopaminergic cell tonic and phasic activity is closely dependent upon projections from hindbrain pedunculopontine and the laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, which comprises the only known cholinergic inputs to these neurons. In close coordination with glutamatergic and GABAergic activity, these excitatory cholinergic projections activate nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors within the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area to modulate dopamine transmission in the dorsal/ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex. Additionally, acetylcholine-containing interneurons in the striatum also constitute an important neural substrate to provide further cholinergic modulation of forebrain striatal dopaminergic transmission. In this review, we examine neurological and psychopathological conditions associated with dysfunctions in the interaction of acetylcholine and dopamine and conventional and new pharmacological approaches to treat these disorders.

Title:A new stochastic and state space model of human colon cancer incorporating multiple pathways.
Authors:['Tan WY', 'Yan XW']
Affiliation:Department of Mathematical Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-6429, USA. waitan@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies by molecular biologists and geneticists have shown that tumors of human colon cancer are developed from colon stem cells through two mechanisms: The chromosomal instability and the micro-satellite instability. The purpose of this paper is therefore to develop a new stochastic and state space model for carcinogenesis of human colon cancer incorporating these biological mechanisms. RESULTS: Based on recent biological studies, in this paper we have developed a state space model for human colon cancer. In this state space model, the stochastic system is represented by a stochastic model, involving 2 different pathways-the chromosomal instability pathway and the micro-satellite instability pathway; the observation, cancer incidence data, is represented by a statistical model. Based on this model we have developed a generalized Bayesian approach to estimate the parameters through the posterior modes of the parameters via Gibbs sampling procedures. We have applied this model to fit and analyze the SEER data of human colon cancers from NCI/NIH. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the model not only provides a logical avenue to incorporate biological information but also fits the data much better than other models including the 4-stage single pathway model. This model not only would provide more insights into human colon cancer but also would provide useful guidance for its prevention and control and for prediction of future cancer cases.

Title:Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of DNA condensation by block copolymer and formation of core-corona structures.
Authors:['Ziebarth J', 'Wang Y']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are used to study the condensation of single polyanion chains with block copolymers composed of cationic and neutral blocks. The simulations are an effort to model complexes formed with DNA and cationic copolymers such as polyethylenimine-g-polyethylene glycol which have been used in gene delivery. The simulations reveal that increases in the cationic block length of the copolymer result in greater condensation of the polyanion. The ability of the complexes to form core-corona structures, with the neutral blocks of the copolymers forming a corona around a dense core formed from the charged beads, is investigated. The core-corona structure is shown to be dependent on both condensation of the polyanion chain and the length of the neutral block of the copolymer. Increasing the length of the cationic and neutral blocks of the copolymer both result in improvement in the core-corona structure. The internal structure of the complex core is shown to be a function of the architecture of the copolymer. Complexes formed from linear diblock copolymers have homogeneous cores with similarly arranged cationic and anionic beads; however, complexes formed with star-shaped copolymers have a layered core structure, with anionic beads found in the center of the cores.

Abstract:Recent studies have explored feeding kinematics in tadpoles with intact labial teeth; however, it is unknown how missing teeth impacts foraging. We explored the impact of missing labial teeth on the feeding mechanics and foraging performance of Southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephalus [= Rana sphenocephala]) tadpoles by controlling the pattern of labial tooth loss; that is, by surgically removing one row of labial teeth. We then used high-speed (500 frames/second) videography to test the hypothesis that tooth loss reduces the time that tadpoles attach to and graze upon an algal-covered substrate. We next conducted trials of foraging efficiency and foraging activity to test the hypothesis that tadpoles with fewer teeth forage less effectively than control tadpoles. The teeth of tadpoles from the surgery treatment slipped while closing and were in contact with an algal-covered substrate for a shorter duration compared to control tadpoles. Surprisingly, tadpoles with missing labial teeth obtained similar amounts of food and were as active as tadpoles with intact mouthparts. However, tadpoles with missing teeth completed about 25% more gape cycles per unit time than control tadpoles. Our data suggest that tadpoles with missing teeth compensate for inferior feeding kinematics during mouth closing in each gape cycle by increasing the number of gape cycles per unit time.

Title:The effect of long-term, high-volume aerobic exercise training on postprandial lipemia and oxidative stress.

Abstract:AIMS: We have previously found no effect of moderate-volume aerobic exercise training (approximately 3 hrs*wk(-1)) on postprandial oxidative stress. It is possible that a higher volume of exercise is needed to impact postprandial oxidative stress in young, otherwise healthy individuals. Our purpose was to compare blood triglycerides (TAGs) and oxidative stress biomarkers in 10 healthy untrained and 10 healthy highly aerobically trained (eg, >or= 40 miles running*wk(-1) or >or= 150 miles cycling*wk(-1)) men and women following ingestion of a lipid meal. METHODS: Blood samples were collected before (in a 10-hour fasted state), and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after ingestion of a lipid load (heavy whipping cream at 1 g*kg(-1)). Blood samples were analyzed for TAGs, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), and nitrate/nitrite (NOx). RESULTS: No training status or interaction effects were noted for TAGs, MDA, H2O2, or NOx (P > 0.05). However, a time effect was noted for TAGs (P = 0.01), with values higher at 2 hours (67 +/- 6 mg*dL(-1)) compared with premeal (41 +/- 6 mg*dL(-1)). A time effect was also noted for H2O2 (P = 0.0001), with values higher at 2 hours (24 +/- 3 micromol*L(-1)), 4 hours (23 +/- 3 micromol*L(-1)), and 6 hours (21 +/- 3 mumol.L(-1)) compared with premeal (7 +/- 2 micromol*L(-1)). The time effect for MDA approached significance (P = 0.07), with values peaking at 4 hours post-meal (1.59 +/- 0.16 micromol*L(-1)) compared with premeal (0.99 +/- 0.15 micromol*L(-1)). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that aerobic exercise training (even when performed at a relatively high volume) does not attenuate postprandial lipemia or oxidative stress as compared with no exercise when healthy men and women consume a lipid load in the form of heavy whipping cream. Fasting TAG values may be most important in this regard. It is possible that long-term exercise may be capable of attenuating postprandial lipemia or oxidative stress in older individuals, those with chronic disease, or those with elevated fasting TAG values. Future work is needed to confirm these hypotheses.

Title:Impact of serum estradiol on postprandial lipemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation across a single menstrual cycle.
Authors:['Bell HK', 'Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: An abrupt rise in circulating lipids, oxidative stress, and inflammatory biomarkers is a common finding after ingestion of a high-fat meal. Estradiol, typically provided via hormone replacement therapy to postmenopausal women, has been reported to possess lipidemic, antioxidant, and antiinflammatory properties, all of which may minimize postprandial oxidative stress. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the postprandial triglyceride (TG), oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses after a lipid meal in menstruating women during the early follicular (days 1-3) and preovulatory (day 14) phases of the menstrual cycle. METHODS: Healthy normolipidemic women (fasting blood TG, <200 mg/dL) with regular menstrual cycles reported to the Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory at the University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee (October-December 2008) and consumed an identical lipid meal (heavy whipping cream and water) on 2 separate days during the menstrual cycle. Blood samples were collected premeal and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postmeal, then assayed for TG, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAL), nitrate/nitrite, and C-reactive protein (CRP). The AUC was calculated for each variable, and a 2 (menstrual cycle phase) x 5 (time) ANOVA with Tukey post hoc testing was also conducted. Estradiol concentration was measured in premeal samples for verification of cycle phase. RESULTS: Ten women (mean [SD] age, 29 [11] years; 8 white, 2 black; body mass index, 22 [3] kg/m(2)) participated in the study. Despite a higher serum estradiol concentration on day 14 (113 [56] pg/mL) compared with the early follicular phase (61 [34] pg/mL), the TG, oxidative stress, and inflammatory AUC responses to feeding were not significantly different. TG (P = 0.03), MDA (P = 0.02), and hydrogen peroxide (P < 0.001) were significantly increased in response to feeding (time effect), whereas nitrate/nitrite was decreased (P = 0.01). TEAC and CRP were not significantly affected. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that estradiol, at the concentrations noted in the present study, had no significant effect on postprandial TG or biomarkers of oxidative stress or inflammation in a sample of young, healthy women. It is possible that a greater divergence in circulating estradiol may be needed for significant differences to be detected, as may be the case with chronic hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women.

Title:Surface plasmon resonance aided electrochemical immunosensor for CK-MB determination in undiluted serum samples.

Abstract:This article presents a simple chronoamperometric immunosensor for the quantitative assessment of creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) in 50 microL undiluted serum samples. The immunosensor consists of gold working and counter electrodes patterned onto a glass chip by thin-film photolithography and an external Ag|AgCl reference electrode. The detection limit (DL) of the chronoamperometric method is 13 ng mL(-1) (DL = 2xRMSD/S, where RMSD is the residual mean standard deviation of the measured points around a calibration curve with a slope of S). In spiked serum samples, the response was linear up to 300 ng mL(-1) of CK-MB. A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system with simultaneous electrochemical detection (EC-SPR) aided the development of the sandwich immunoassay. Real-time monitoring of the SPR signal was used to optimize the capture antibody immobilization, CK-MB and detection antibody binding, as well as to minimize the nonspecific adsorption of serum proteins to the sensor surface. The detection antibody has been labeled with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme for sensitive electrochemical detection. ALP catalyzes the hydrolysis of ascorbic acid phosphate and generates ascorbic acid, which is measured chronoamperometrically. The electrochemical immunoassay for CK-MB was less sensitive to nonspecific adsorption related interferences, had a better detection limit, and required a lower volume of sample than the SPR method.

Abstract:Iron oxide magnetic nano-particles have been prepared by precipitation in an aqueous solution of iron(II) and iron(III) chlorides under basic condition. Surface modifications have been carried out by using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS). The uncoated and coated particles have been characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), and infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy. The particle sizes as measured from TEM images were found to have mean diameters of 13nm for the uncoated and about 19nm for the coated particles. The measured IR spectra of the uncoated and MPTMS coated particles showed the conversion of magnetite to hematite at high temperature. The results obtained from both IR spectroscopy and TGA revealed that the mercaptopropylsilyl group in the MPTMS coated magnetite decomposed at 600 degrees C and the silica layer of the TEOS coated magnetite was rather stable. Raman spectroscopy has shown the laser heating effect through the conversion of magnetite to maghemite and hematite.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: We compared Glycine Propionyl-L-Carnitine (GlycoCarn(R)) and three different pre-workout nutritional supplements on measures of skeletal muscle oxygen saturation (StO2), blood nitrate/nitrite (NOx), lactate (HLa), malondialdehyde (MDA), and exercise performance in men. METHODS: Using a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, 19 resistance trained men performed tests of muscular power (bench press throws) and endurance (10 sets of bench press to muscular failure). A placebo, GlycoCarn(R), or one of three dietary supplements (SUPP1, SUPP2, SUPP3) was consumed prior to exercise, with one week separating conditions. Blood was collected before receiving the condition and immediately after exercise. StO2 was measured during the endurance test using Near Infrared Spectroscopy. Heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were determined at the end of each set. RESULTS: A condition effect was noted for StO2 at the start of exercise (p = 0.02), with GlycoCarn(R) higher than SUPP2. A condition effect was also noted for StO2 at the end of exercise (p = 0.003), with SUPP1 lower than all other conditions. No statistically significant interaction, condition, or time effects were noted for NOx or MDA (p > 0.05); however, MDA decreased 13.7% with GlycoCarn(R) and increased in all other conditions. Only a time effect was noted for HLa (p < 0.0001), with values increasing from pre- to post-exercise. No effects were noted for HR, RPE, or for any exercise performance variables (p > 0.05); however, GlycoCarn(R) resulted in a statistically insignificant greater total volume load compared to the placebo (3.3%), SUPP1 (4.2%), SUPP2 (2.5%), and SUPP3 (4.6%). CONCLUSION: None of the products tested resulted in favorable changes in our chosen outcome measures, with the exception of GlycoCarn(R) in terms of higher StO2 at the start of exercise. GlycoCarn(R) resulted in a 13.7% decrease in MDA from pre- to post-exercise and yielded a non-significant but greater total volume load compared to all other conditions. These data indicate that 1) a single ingredient (GlycoCarn(R)) can provide similar practical benefit than finished products containing multiple ingredients, and 2) while we do not have data in relation to post-exercise recovery parameters, the tested products are ineffective in terms of increasing blood flow and improving acute upper body exercise performance.

Title:Mechanoreceptors found in a posterior cruciate ligament from a well-functioning total knee arthroplasty retrieval.

Affiliation:InMotion Orthopaedic Research Center, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:Histologic analysis of the posterior cruciate ligament has been reported in the normal and osteoarthritic knee but not after cruciate-retaining (CR) total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Retention of the posterior cruciate ligament during TKA has been debated as to whether it is beneficial in stability and function. If the presence of mechanoreceptors is shown to be maintained in CR TKA, then there may be an argument for retention. This case report used a retrieval of a well-functioning TKA specimen that had a CR TKA. To prove the presence of mechanoreceptors within the ligament, immunohistochemistry techniques using S100 protein and neurofilament protein were used. This specimen had pacini and lamellar type of mechanoreceptors present on immunohistochemistry analysis. The presence or retention of mechanoreceptors and innervations of the ligament may indicate an advantage when retained during TKA.

Abstract:PURPOSE: Microbial contamination associated with different methods of neonatal intravenous fat emulsion (IVFE) preparation and delivery was evaluated. METHODS: Sterility testing was performed on IVFE dispensed via three different methods: (1) in the original container (n = 60), (2) repackaged into a syringe (n = 90), and (3) drawdown of the original container (n = 60). At the end of each infusion (24 hours for methods 1 and 3, 12 hours for method 2), a sample of the IVFE was withdrawn from the container using a sterile syringe in an International Organization for Standardization class 5 hood and sent to the hospital microbiology laboratory, where the samples were introduced into blood culture bottles and incubated for five days. Each sample was then subcultured on a blood agar plate with olive oil and left for an additional two days in a carbon dioxide incubator to assess for Malassezia furfur. RESULTS: None of the samples from the original containers showed bacterial or fungal growth. Three of the samples from syringes had bacterial growth (two samples contained coagulase-negative staphylococcus and one contained both Klebsiella oxytoca and Citrobacter freundii), yielding a contamination rate of 3.3%. The number of contaminated samples did not significantly differ among the three preparation methods (p = 0.13). CONCLUSION: Repackaging IVFE into sterile syringes resulted in bacterial contamination and should be avoided in clinical practice. IVFE samples obtained using the drawdown procedure under sterile conditions for infusion over 24 hours revealed no microbial contamination.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there would be racial and ethnic disparities in meeting eligibility criteria for medication therapy management (MTM) services implemented in 2006 for Medicare beneficiaries. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Secondary data analyses of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2004-2005). STUDY DESIGN: Logistic regression and recycled predictions were used to test the disparities in meeting eligibility criteria across racial and ethnic groups. The eligibility thresholds used by health plans in 2006 and new thresholds recommended for 2010 were examined. Racial and ethnic disparities were examined by comparing non-Hispanic blacks (blacks) with non-Hispanic whites (whites) and comparing Hispanics with whites, respectively. Disparities were also examined among individuals with severe health problems. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: According to 2006 thresholds, the adjusted odds ratios for meeting eligibility criteria for blacks and Hispanics to whites were 0.36-0.60 (p<.05) and 0.13-0.46 (p<.05), respectively. Blacks and Hispanics would be 21-34 and 32-38 percent, respectively, less likely to be eligible than whites according to recycled predictions. Similar patterns were found using the 2010 eligibility thresholds and among individuals with severe health problems. CONCLUSIONS: There would be racial and ethnic disparities in meeting MTM eligibility criteria. Future research is warranted to confirm the findings using data after MTM implementation.

Abstract:Dietary fluid and sodium intake may influence the risk for vasoocclusive events in persons with sickle cell anemia (SCA). The objective of this study was to examine the dietary intake of water and sodium in children and adolescents with SCA and identify possible factors influencing intake. We compared water (mL) and sodium (mg) intake in 21 patients with SCA, aged 5 to 18 years, to reported adequate intake for water, daily fluid requirement, upper limit for sodium, and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005 to 2006 data for sodium, and sociodemographic factors. Dietary intake from 3-day food records was evaluated retrospectively. Median water intake was significantly lower than adequate intake, and median sodium intake was significantly higher than sodium upper limit. Sociodemographic factors were not associated with dietary water or sodium intake. Our results suggest that children and adolescents with SCA would benefit from education regarding increasing fluid intake and limiting high sodium foods.

Abstract:Three-point bending technology has been widely used in the measurement of bone strength. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for bone strength have been identified using mouse femurs. In this study, we investigate the use of mouse tibiae in identification of QTLs that regulate bone strength. Mouse tibiae were from a F(2) population derived from C57BL/6J (B6) and C3H/HeJ (C3H). Three-point bending was measured using ISO 4049, with the support width adjustable to accommodate specimen sizes outside the scope of ISO 4049. The strain rate is selectable from 0.05 to 500 mm per min. All stress strain diagrams are recorded and retrieved in digital electronic form. Genome scan was performed in The Jackson Laboratory (TJL). QTL mapping was conducted using Map Manager QTX software. Data show that (i) both elastic modulus (stiffness) and maximum loading (strength) value appear as normal distributions, suggesting that multiple genetic factors control the bone strength; (ii) 11 QTLs, accounting for 90% of variation for strength, have been detected. More than half QTLs of three-point bending are located on the same locations of bone density earlier identified from mouse femurs; (iii) a major QTL of femoral and vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) was not detected for bone strength of tibiae; (iv) the QTL on chromosome 4 has extremely high LOD score of 31.8 and represents 60% of the variation of bone strength; and (v) four QTLs of stiffness (chromosomes 2, 11, 15 and 19) have been identified.

Abstract:Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was explored in a sample of 119 custodial grandparents. A latent profile analysis identified three groups of grandparents along a continuum of good to poor HRQOL, with most custodial grandparents reporting Short Form-12 Health Survey (version 2) scores significantly below U.S. population means. Grandparent and grandchild characteristics that predicted grandparent HRQOL were identified. Grandchild health problems, number of grandchildren in custody, and grandparent education contributed to a moderate reduction in HRQOL. A large reduction in HRQOL was predicted by depression. Differences in depression were reported between groups, with grandparents with poor HRQOL also reporting clinically significant depression, grandparents with fair HRQOL reporting marginally clinically significant depression, and grandparents with good HRQOL reporting no depression. In a qualitative analysis, grandparent conceptualization of what they need to do to maintain and improve their health was explored for each group. Findings from the quantitative analysis indicate variation in grandparent health and mental health status and suggest that services should be tailored to address grandparent needs. The qualitative analysis highlights the importance of religion and spirituality to grandparents, the economic concerns of grandparents, and the need for transdisciplinary services.

Title:Reach height and jump displacement: implications for standardization of reach determination.
Authors:['Ferreira LC', 'Schilling BK', 'Weiss LW', 'Fry AC', 'Chiu LZ']
Affiliation:Exercise Neuromechanics Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:Vertical jump performance is often assessed using jump-and-reach tests. The exact procedure used for determining standing reach height and jump height has a large effect on the resultant displacement. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the influence of 4 methods of standing reach height measurement and Vertec jump height measurement against 2 force plate methods of jump displacement determination (impulse and flight-time methods). Fifteen men with various training backgrounds performed 2 each of countermovement, restricted (no arm swing) and static start vertical jumps. Reach height was determined using 4 methods; either a 1- or overlapped 2-hand reach, flat footed or with plantar flexion. All jumps were performed on a force platform. The best jump of each type based on Vertec displacement was used for analysis. Repeated-measures of analysis of variance for each jump type was used for analysis with Bonferroni post hoc for pairwise comparisons of jump measurement style. All jump displacements for similar types were significantly intercorrelated with a minimum r-value of 0.84. Impulse vs. flight time was the only pairwise comparison of measurement type for which similar values were noted. The one-hand reach with plantar flexion was the method of reach that was closest to the impulse and flight-time methods, and thus should be the preferred choice when using jump-and-reach tests to determine jump displacement. In all cases, the Vertec overestimates the displacement of the COM based on force plate methods. When comparing groups of individuals from different data sets, one must consider both the method of reach height (if performed) and jump displacement to make valid comparisons. If plantar flexion with a 1-hand reach is not used during reach measurement, jump displacement will be erroneously high.

Abstract:The growing infection rate by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, especially with bone fracture fixation implants, is a major concern in extremity musculoskeletal wound treatment. This preliminary investigation evaluates the ability of chitosan film to be loaded with daptomycin and vancomycin in the operating room, in situ loading, and applied to musculoskeletal fixation devices to lessen or prevent infection. Films with 61, 71, and 80% degrees of deacetylation (DDA) made using lactic or acetic acid solvents were analyzed for their antibiotic uptake, elution, and activity along with film swelling ratio, ultimate tensile strength, Young's modulus, adhesive strength, and degradation. Chitosan films after 1 min of rehydration were able in a simulated, clinical setting to maintain mechanical integrity and adhesive strength to be applied to bone fracture fixation devices or implant surfaces. The film percent degradation increased with DDA increasing from 61 to 80%, but film degradation rate decreased in the presence of antibiotics. Eighty percent DDA chitosan films were optimal for absorbing and eluting antibiotics. Antibiotics eluted by the films were active against Staphylococcus aureus. These findings indicate that an 80% DDA chitosan film is potentially advantageous as a clinically adjunctive treatment in musculoskeletal injuries to lessen or prevent infections.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: ChIP-Seq is a powerful tool for identifying the interaction between genomic regulators and their bound DNAs, especially for locating transcription factor binding sites. However, high cost and high rate of false discovery of transcription factor binding sites identified from ChIP-Seq data significantly limit its application. RESULTS: Here we report a new algorithm, ChIP-PaM, for identifying transcription factor target regions in ChIP-Seq datasets. This algorithm makes full use of a protein-DNA binding pattern by capitalizing on three lines of evidence: 1) the tag count modelling at the peak position, 2) pattern matching of a specific tag count distribution, and 3) motif searching along the genome. A novel data-based two-step eFDR procedure is proposed to integrate the three lines of evidence to determine significantly enriched regions. Our algorithm requires no technical controls and efficiently discriminates falsely enriched regions from regions enriched by true transcription factor (TF) binding on the basis of ChIP-Seq data only. An analysis of real genomic data is presented to demonstrate our method. CONCLUSIONS: In a comparison with other existing methods, we found that our algorithm provides more accurate binding site discovery while maintaining comparable statistical power.

Abstract:The National Institute of Health and the US FDA have regulations on the inclusion of minorities in research, and guidelines on how to conduct and report subgroup analyses among each racial and ethnic group. Although health-related quality of life (HRQL) has enjoyed increased popularity as an important end point in clinical research, the literature lacks a comprehensive review on whether or not racial and ethnic groups report HRQL differently, particularly among patients with specific disease states. HRQL is different from most other end points in clinical research in that it is reported by patients and thus is affected by patients' racial and ethnic background in a special way. This paper summarizes the existing literature on patterns of reporting HRQL across racial and ethnic groups. It begins with a summary of general HRQL patterns and subsequently covers HRQL related to renal disease, breast cancer and prostate cancer. This paper is not intended to be exhaustive, but to inform researchers of good practice in clinical research utilizing HRQL as study end points.

Title:Oxidative stress in response to forearm ischemia-reperfusion with and without carnitine administration.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ', 'Smith WA', 'Fisher-Wellman KH']
Affiliation:Department of Health and Sport Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis TN 38152, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu
Abstract:UNLABELLED: We have recently noted a decrease in lipid peroxidation with oral intake of glycine propionyl-L-carnitine (GPLC). However, these findings were observed at rest, and in previously sedentary subjects. METHODS: We determined the effect of GPLC on oxidative stress biomarkers at rest and in response to reactive hyperemia in exercise-trained men. Using a double-blind, crossover design, 15 healthy men were assigned to a placebo and GPLC (4.5 g/day) in random order, for four weeks, with a two-week washout between assignments. Blood samples were collected at rest and at 0, 3, and 10 minutes following a protocol of ischemia-reperfusion, and analyzed for lactate, malondialdehyde (MDA), F(2)-isoprostanes (F(2)-iso), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), xanthine oxidase activity (XO), hypoxanthine (HYPO), total (TGSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). RESULTS: No condition or condition by time interaction effects were noted (p>0.05). Time effects were noted for lactate (p<0.0001), MDA (p=0.02), H(2)O(2) (p=0.0003), XO (p=0.03), HYPO (p<0.0001), TGSH (p=0.02), and GSSG (p<0.0001), with peak values noted at 0 minutes post for lactate, MDA, TGSH, and GSSG, at 3 minutes post for H(2)O(2) and XO, and at 10 minutes post for HYPO. F(2)-iso and TEAC were unaffected by treatment or protocol (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Short-term ischemia-reperfusion in trained men results in a modest and transient increase in selected blood oxidative stress biomarkers. Oral GPLC supplementation does not attenuate the increase in these biomarkers.

Title:African American homicide bereavement: aspects of social support that predict complicated grief, PTSD, and depression.
Authors:['Burke LA', 'Neimeyer RA', 'McDevitt-Murphy ME']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Department of Psychology, TN 38152, USA. laburke@memphis.edu
Abstract:Psychological adaptation following homicide loss is challenged not only by the violent nature of the death itself but also by the bereaved's relationships with would-be supporters. Recruiting a sample of 54 African-American homicidally bereaved individuals, we examined perceived and actual support, the size of the support network, family versus non-family support, and number of negative relationships to gauge the role of social support in bereavement outcomes such as complicated grief, PTSD, and depression. Results of quantitative assessments revealed that size of available network, quantity of negative relationships, and levels of grief-specific support were correlated with bereavement outcome. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research on the role of social support in adaptation of African Americans to traumatic loss are discussed.

Title:A study of silent disengagement and distressing emotion in psychotherapy.
Authors:['Stringer JV', 'Levitt HM', 'Berman JS', 'Mathews SS']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA. jvstringer@gmail.com
Abstract:Fifty-two psychotherapy sessions were coded for silences that reflect processes of client disengagement (e.g., withdrawal, resistance). The study examined the presence of these silences and clients' reports of in-session emotion and symptom change. Results indicated that disengagement predicted poorer proximal and distal outcome as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care (BDI-PC) and poorer proximal outcome on the Symptom Checklist-5, but it was not significantly predictive of Outcome Questionnaire-45 scores. Interitem analyses revealed that disengagement had a significant proximal effect on depressive mood and negative self-evaluative items assessed by the BDI-PC, but across time these effects were sustained for the negative self-evaluative items only.

Title:Fungal pathogen changes the feeding kinematics of larval anurans.
Authors:['Venesky MD', 'Wassersug RJ', 'Parris MJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. mvenesky@memphis.edu
Abstract:Pathogens can alter host life-history traits by affecting host feeding activities. In anuran tadpoles, keratinized mouthparts (teeth and jaw sheaths) are essential for feeding. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( Bd ) is a pathogenic fungus of amphibians that can infect these mouthparts and reduce tadpole survival. However, the precise way that Bd-induced changes in tadpole mouthparts impact tadpole feeding is unknown. We use high-speed (500 frames/sec) videography to study how Bd-induced mouthpart deformities affect the feeding kinematics of Fowler's toad (Anaxyrus [= Bufo] fowleri ) and grey tree frog (Hyla chrysoscelis) tadpoles. We tested for species-specific patterns of Bd-induced mouthpart deformities to assess how deformations to specific areas of tadpole mouthparts alter feeding kinematics. The teeth of tadpoles from the Bd-exposed treatment slipped off of surfaces on which tadpoles graze and were in contact with an algal-covered substratum for a shorter duration in each gape cycle compared to teeth of control tadpoles. We also found that the jaw sheaths had significantly more deformations than labial teeth; however, how this relates to feeding kinematics is unclear. Our data show explicitly how Bd infection reduces foraging efficiency of anuran tadpoles by altering feeding kinematics and elucidate a mechanistic link between the pathogen infection and reduced host fitness.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Young adult survivors of childhood brain tumors (BTs) may have late effects that compromise physical performance and everyday task participation. The objective of this study was to evaluate muscle strength, fitness, physical performance, and task participation among adult survivors of childhood BTs. METHODS: In-home evaluations and interviews were conducted for 156 participants (54% men). Results on measures of muscle strength, fitness, physical performance, and participation were compared between BT survivors and members of a population-based comparison group by using chi-square statistics and 2-sample t tests. Associations between late effects and physical performance and between physical performance and participation were evaluated in regression models. RESULTS: : The median age of BT survivors was 22 years (range, 18-58 years) at the time of the current evaluation, and they had survived for a median of 14.7 years (range, 6.5-45.9 years) postdiagnosis. Survivors had lower estimates of grip strength (women, 24.7 + or - 9.2 kg vs 31.5 + or - 5.8 kg; men, 39.0 + or - 12.2 kg vs 53.0 + or - 10.1 kg), knee extension strength (women, 246.6 + or - 95.5 Newtons [N] vs 331.5 + or - 5.8 N; men, 304.7 + or - 116.4 N vs 466.6 + or - 92.1 N), and peak oxygen uptake (women, 25.1 + or - 8.8 mL/kg per minute vs 31.3 + or - 5.1 mL/kg per minute; men, 24.6 + or - 9.5 mL/kg per minute vs 33.2 + or - 3.4 mL/kg per minute) than members of the population-based comparison group. Physical performance was lower among survivors and was associated with not living independently (odds ratio [OR], 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-12.2) and not attending college (OR, 2.3; 95% CI 1.2-4.4). CONCLUSIONS: Muscle strength and fitness values among BT survivors were similar to those among individuals aged > or = 60 years and were associated with physical performance limitations. Physical performance limitations were associated with poor outcomes in home and school environments. The current data indicated an opportunity for interventions targeted at improving long-term physical function in this survivor population.

Title:(S)-FTY720-vinylphosphonate, an analogue of the immunosuppressive agent FTY720, is a pan-antagonist of sphingosine 1-phosphate GPCR signaling and inhibits autotaxin activity.

Abstract:FTY720 (Fingolimod), a synthetic analogue of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), activates four of the five EDG-family S1P receptors and is in a phase-III clinical study for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. (S)-FTY720-phosphate (FTY720-P) causes S1P(1) receptor internalization and targeting to the proteasomal degradative pathway, and thus functions as an antagonist of S1P(1) by depleting the functional S1P(1) receptor from the plasma membrane. Here we describe the pharmacological characterization of two unsaturated phosphonate enantiomers of FTY720, (R)- and (S)-FTY720-vinylphosphonate. (R)-FTY720-vinylphosphonate was a full agonist of S1P(1) (EC(50) 20+/-3 nM). In contrast, the (S) enantiomer failed to activate any of the five S1P GPCRs and was a full antagonist of S1P(1,3,4) (K(i) 384 nM, 39 nM, and 1190 nM, respectively) and a partial antagonist of S1P(2), and S1P(5). Both enantiomers dose-dependently inhibited lysophospholipase D (recombinant autotaxin) with K(i) values in the low micromolar range, although with different enzyme kinetic mechanisms. When injected into mice, both enantiomers caused transient peripheral lymphopenia. (R)- and (S)-FTY720-vinylphosphonates activated ERK1/2, AKT, and exerted an antiapoptotic effect in camptothecin-treated IEC-6 intestinal epithelial cells, which primarily express S1P(2) transcripts and traces of S1P(5). (S)-FTY720-vinylphosphonate is the first pan-antagonist of S1P receptors and offers utility in probing S1P responses in vitro and in vivo. The biological effects of the (R)- and (S)-FTY720-vinylphosphonate analogues underscore the complexity of FTY720 cellular targets.

Abstract:Although behavioral inflexibility and Purkinje cell loss are both well established in autism, it is unknown if these phenomena are causally related. Using a mouse model, we tested the hypothesis that developmental abnormalities of the cerebellum, including Purkinje cell loss, result in behavioral inflexibility. Specifically, we made aggregation chimeras (Lc/+<-->+/+) between lurcher (Lc/+) mutant embryos and wildtype (+/+) control embryos. Lurcher mice lose 100% of their Purkinje cells postnatally, while chimeric mice lose varying numbers of Purkinje cells. We tested these mice on the acquisition and serial reversals of an operant conditional visual discrimination, a test of behavioral flexibility in rodents. During reversals 1 and 2, all groups of mice committed similar numbers of "perseverative" errors (those committed while session performance was <= 40% correct). Lurchers, however, committed a significantly greater number of "learning" errors (those committed while session performance was between 41% and 85% correct) than both controls and chimeras, and most were unable to advance past reversal 3. During reversals 3 and 4, chimeras, as a group, committed more "perseverative", but not "learning" errors than controls, although a comparison of Purkinje cell number and performance in individual mice revealed that chimeras with fewer Purkinje cells made more "learning" errors and had shorter response latencies than chimeras with more Purkinje cells. These data suggest that developmental cerebellar Purkinje cell loss may affect higher level cognitive processes which have previously been shown to be mediated by the prefrontal cortex, and are commonly deficient in autism spectrum disorders.

Title:Sources and migration of volatile organic compounds in mixed-use buildings.
Authors:['Jia C', 'Batterman S', 'Godwin C', 'Charles S', 'Chin JY']
Affiliation:School of Public Health, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:UNLABELLED: We examined concentrations and migration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ten mixed-use buildings in southeast Michigan, USA. In an office and work zone in each building, air exchange rates (AERs) were measured using perfluorocarbon tracers, and over 96 VOC species were measured by GC/MS over a 7-day period. VOCs were then apportioned to sources in offices, work zones, and outdoors using a two-zone mass balance model. AERs averaged 3.9 h (0.2-14.2 h) in offices and 1.9 h (0.4-3.5 h) in work zones. The dominant VOCs included aromatics, terpenes and alkanes. VOC concentrations were uniform in the smaller spaces, and more variable in some of the very large spaces. Apportionments depended on the VOC and building, but emissions in industrial zones of buildings often migrated to office areas where they frequently accounted for the bulk of VOC concentrations. Outdoor sources accounted for most benzene and carbon tetrachloride, and a small fraction of aromatic and aliphatic compounds. This study shows that pollutant migration can be a significant and not uncommon problem in mixed-use buildings, and it demonstrates the need for better control of emissions and pollutant migration. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Pollutant exposures in industrial, commercial, and institutional buildings arise from indoor and outdoor sources that can be identified, apportioned, and controlled with knowledge of emission sources and building airflows. We show that multi-tracer techniques are an effective and practical means of determining airflows and exchange rates in large buildings. In examining a set of mixed-use buildings, a substantial fraction of VOC exposures in otherwise relatively 'clean' offices is due to pollutant migration from 'dirty' zones of the building. This indicates the need for corrective actions to minimize exposures of office workers that are unwanted and probably unknown to building managers. These actions should include better control of emissions, isolation or control of air and pollutant flows between building zones, and documentation of the effectiveness of such measures when strong emission sources are present.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Professional sport organizations in the United States have notable celebrity status, and several teams have used this "star power" to collaborate with local school districts toward the goal of affecting children's health. Program effectiveness is unknown due to the absence of comprehensive evaluations for these initiatives. The Memphis Grizzlies, the city's National Basketball Association franchise, launched "Get Fit with the Grizzlies," a 6-week, curricular addition focusing on nutrition and physical activity for the fourth and fifth grades in Memphis City Schools (MCS). The health-infused mini-unit was delivered by physical education teachers during their classes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the "Get Fit" program effectiveness. METHODS: Survey research was employed which measured health knowledge acquisition and health behavior change using a matched pre/posttest design in randomly chosen schools (n = 11) from all elementary schools in the MCS system (N = 110). The total number of matched pre/posttests (n = 888) equaled approximately 5% of the total fourth-/fifth-grade population. McNemar's test for significance (p < .05) was applied. Odds ratios were calculated for each question. RESULTS: Analyses confirmed that there was significant health knowledge acquisition (7 of 8 questions) with odds ratios confirming moderate to strong associations. Seven out of 10 health behavior change questions significantly improved after intervention, whereas odds ratios indicated a low level of association after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This community-school-home initiative using a professional team's celebrity platform within a certain locale is largely overlooked by school districts and should be considered as a positive strategy to confront childhood obesity.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To determine the status of diabetes care among community pharmacy patients with diabetes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: United States, 2005. PATIENTS: 1,455 community pharmacy patients aged 18 years or older with diabetes who were diagnosed before 2005. INTERVENTION: Analysis of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions of patients meeting American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of medical care in diabetes. RESULTS: In 2005, 1,455 patients with diabetes who were diagnosed before 2005 filled prescriptions through community pharmacies. Gaps occurred between the diabetes care of these patients and ADA standards. Examples include the following: ADA recommends at least two glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) tests annually, but 19.52% of the study population reported less than two A1C tests in 2005; ADA recommends annual influenza vaccinations, but 42.46% of the study population reported not receiving an influenza vaccination in 2005; and ADA recommends weight control, but 83.74% of the study population was overweight or obese. CONCLUSION: The current results demonstrate that many patients with diabetes are not receiving adequate care and that pharmacists have an opportunity to improve diabetes management.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: In the present investigation we compared blood epinephrine (EPI), norepinephrine (NE), free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol concentrations in response to a capsaicinoid supplement or placebo in healthy adults before and after acute exercise. METHODS: Twenty subjects ingested a placebo or supplement (Capsimax, OmniActive Health Technologies; 2 mg capsaicinoids in a microencapsulated matrix) with one week separating conditions. Fasting blood samples were collected during each visit; 30 minutes following a rest period and before placebo or supplement intake (Pre); 2 hours post intake (2 hr); one minute following the cessation of 30 minutes of exercise performed at 65% of maximal heart rate reserve (2.5 hr); 90 minutes following the cessation of exercise (4 hr). Heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were recorded at all times. RESULTS: A time effect was noted for HR, SBP, and DBP (p < 0.05), with HR and SBP higher at 2.5 hr compared to Pre (due to exercise) and DBP lower at 2.5 hr compared to Pre. No interaction or condition effects were noted for EPI, NE, FFA, or glycerol (p > 0.05). However, a time effect was noted for all variables (p < 0.0001), with values higher than Pre at 2.5 hr for EPI and glycerol, at 2 hr and 2.5 hours for FFA, and at 2 hr, 2.5 hr, and 4 hr for NE (p < 0.05). In terms of percent change from Pre, glycerol was higher with Capsimax than for placebo at 4 hr (p = 0.011) and FFA was higher with Capsimax than for placebo at 2 hr (p = 0.025) and at 2.5 hr (p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Ingestion of low dose (2 mg) Capsimax was associated with an increase in blood FFA and glycerol at selected times post ingestion, as compared to placebo. However, Capsimax had no differing effect on EPI or NE compared to placebo. Lastly, no difference was noted in HR, SBP, or DBP between placebo and Capsimax.

Abstract:For generations the study of vocal development and its role in language has been conducted laboriously, with human transcribers and analysts coding and taking measurements from small recorded samples. Our research illustrates a method to obtain measures of early speech development through automated analysis of massive quantities of day-long audio recordings collected naturalistically in children's homes. A primary goal is to provide insights into the development of infant control over infrastructural characteristics of speech through large-scale statistical analysis of strategically selected acoustic parameters. In pursuit of this goal we have discovered that the first automated approach we implemented is not only able to track children's development on acoustic parameters known to play key roles in speech, but also is able to differentiate vocalizations from typically developing children and children with autism or language delay. The method is totally automated, with no human intervention, allowing efficient sampling and analysis at unprecedented scales. The work shows the potential to fundamentally enhance research in vocal development and to add a fully objective measure to the battery used to detect speech-related disorders in early childhood. Thus, automated analysis should soon be able to contribute to screening and diagnosis procedures for early disorders, and more generally, the findings suggest fundamental methods for the study of language in natural environments.

Abstract:Human task performance using a passive interferometric millimeter wave imaging sensor is modeled using a task performance modeling approach developed by the U.S. Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate. The techniques used are illustrated for an imaging system composed of an interferometric antenna array, optical upconversion, and image formation using a shortwave infrared focal plane array. Two tasks, target identification and pilotage, are modeled. The effects of sparse antenna arrays on task performance are considered. Applications of this model include system trade studies for concealed weapon identification, navigation in fog, and brownout conditions.

Title:Biochemical and molecular analysis of carboxylesterase-mediated hydrolysis of cocaine and heroin.

Abstract:BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carboxylesterases (CEs) metabolize a wide range of xenobiotic substrates including heroin, cocaine, meperidine and the anticancer agent CPT-11. In this study, we have purified to homogeneity human liver and intestinal CEs and compared their ability with hydrolyse heroin, cocaine and CPT-11. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The hydrolysis of heroin and cocaine by recombinant human CEs was evaluated and the kinetic parameters determined. In addition, microsomal samples prepared from these tissues were subjected to chromatographic separation, and substrate hydrolysis and amounts of different CEs were determined. KEY RESULTS: In contrast to previous reports, cocaine was not hydrolysed by the human liver CE, hCE1 (CES1), either as highly active recombinant protein or as CEs isolated from human liver or intestinal extracts. These results correlated well with computer-assisted molecular modelling studies that suggested that hydrolysis of cocaine by hCE1 (CES1), would be unlikely to occur. However, cocaine, heroin and CPT-11 were all substrates for the intestinal CE, hiCE (CES2), as determined using both the recombinant protein and the tissue fractions. Again, these data were in agreement with the modelling results. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results indicate that the human liver CE is unlikely to play a role in the metabolism of cocaine and that hydrolysis of this substrate by this class of enzymes is via the human intestinal protein hiCE (CES2). In addition, because no enzyme inhibition is observed at high cocaine concentrations, potentially this route of hydrolysis is important in individuals who overdose on this agent.

Title:Preferred hearing aid gain in everyday environments.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:Thirty-three hearing-impaired individuals were each fitted with three hearing aids. The instruments conformed to three frequency-gain prescriptions, differing by a total of 8 dB/octave, with the middle prescription derived using the MSU version 3.0 procedure. The subjects were divided into three matched groups of eleven. Each group used the fitted hearing aids in one of three everyday listening environments representing quiet, reverberant, and noisy situations, respectively. In each listening environment, preferred hearing aid gain for conversationally produced speech was measured in each hearing aid condition for each subject. Preferred gain in daily listening situations was compared to prescribed gain. Results indicated that: (1) preferred gain averaged across all three environments was about equal to prescribed gain, (2) mean preferred gain in each separate environment was substantially different from the prescribed level, (3) volume control adjustments of about +/- 8 dB relative to the prescribed level would be necessary to accommodate the preferred gain settings of the typical hearing aid wearer in daily life. Guidelines are presented for establishing recommended volume control settings for hearing aid users who may be unable to set the volume control independently.

Title:Hearing aid benefit in everyday environments.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:Hearing aid benefit was measured for three matched groups of eleven hearing-impaired subjects, each serving in one typical listening environment. Benefit was quantified in terms of improvement in intelligibility score for the Connected Speech Test. Each subject was individually fitted with three hearing aids, differing in nominal frequency response slope by a total of 8 dB/octave. Research questions centered on the amount of benefit typically realized in everyday environments and the interactions of this benefit with frequency response and/or visual cues. Results revealed: (1) mean benefit in a living-room type setting was about 24% and significantly greater than in a reverberant setting (7%) and a noisy setting (-1%); (2) despite the relatively large mean difference in benefit between the reverberant and noisy environments, the difference was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05); (3) the addition of visual cues did not change hearing aid benefit in any tested environment; (4) there was no significant overall trend for any of the three different frequency-response slopes to give superior benefit in any environment; (5) 76% of the subjects achieved significantly different benefit (p less than 0.05) in at least one hearing aid condition when data were considered on an individual basis; and (6) articulation indices in the aided conditions did not successfully predict the observed within-subject benefit differences. Benefit was significantly related to speech reception threshold in the living-room environment. However, in the less favorable environments, benefit and hearing loss were not related despite the fact that benefit varied considerably across subjects.

Title:Postprandial oxidative stress in response to dextrose and lipid meals of differing size.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ', 'Kabir MM', 'Marshall KE', 'Canale RE', 'Farney TM']
Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, Department of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu
Abstract:UNLABELLED: We have recently noted that ingestion of dietary lipid (in the form of heavy whipping cream) leads to greater oxidative stress than dietary carbohydrate (in the form of dextrose), when consumed in isocaloric amounts. OBJECTIVE: In the present investigation we attempted to replicate our work and also to determine the oxidative stress response to dextrose and lipid meals of two different kilocalorie (kcal) amounts. DESIGN: Nine young (22 +/- 2 years), healthy men consumed in a random order, cross-over design one of four meals/drinks: dextrose at 75 g (300 kcals), dextrose at 150 g (600 kcals), lipid at 33 g (300 kcals), lipid at 66 g (600 kcals). Blood samples were collected Pre meal, and at 30 min, 60 min, 120 min, and 180 min post meal. Samples were assayed for glucose, triglycerides (TAG), malondialdehyde (MDA), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each variable, and a 4 x 5 ANOVA was utilized to further analyze data. RESULTS: A meal x time effect (p = 0.0002) and a time effect was noted for glucose (p < 0.0001; 30 min > Pre, 1 hr, 2 hr, and 3 hr). The dextrose meals primarily contributed to this time effect. No other effects were noted for glucose (p > 0.05). A meal effect was noted for TAG (p = 0.01; 66 g lipid meal > 75 g and 150 g dextrose meals). No other effects were noted for TAG (p > 0.05). An AUC effect was noted for MDA (p = 0.04; 66 g lipid meal > 75 g and 150 g dextrose meals). A meal x time effect (p = 0.02) and a meal effect was noted for MDA (p = 0.004; 66 g lipid meal > 75 g and 150 g dextrose meals). No time effect was noted for MDA (p = 0.72). An AUC effect was noted for H2O2 (p = 0.0001; 66 g lipid meal > 33 g lipid meal and 75 g and 150 g dextrose meals). A meal x time effect (p = 0.0002), a meal effect (p < 0.0001; 66 g lipid meal > 33 g lipid meal and 75 g and 150 g dextrose meals), and a time effect was noted for H2O2 (p < 0.0001; 2 hr > Pre, 30 min, and 1 hr; 3 hr > Pre). The time effect for H2O2 was primarily influenced by the 66 g lipid meal. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that 1) minimal oxidative stress is observed following ingestion of dextrose loads of either 75 g or 150 g, or a lipid load of 33 g and 2) lipid ingestion at 66 g leads to greater oxidative stress than lipid at 33 g or dextrose at either 75 g or 150 g. Hence, in a sample of young and healthy men, only 66 g of lipid (taken in the form of heavy whipping cream) leads to a significant increase in blood oxidative stress, as measured by MDA and H2O2.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Carboplatin is a common chemotherapy agent with potential ototoxic side effects that is used to treat a variety of pediatric cancers, including retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the retina that is usually diagnosed in young children. Distortion-product otoacoustic emission tests offer an effective method of monitoring for ototoxicity in young children. This study was designed to compare measurements of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions obtained before and after several courses of carboplatin chemotherapy in order to examine if (a) mean distortion-product otoacoustic emission levels were significantly different; and (b) if criterion reductions in distortion-product otoacoustic emission levels were observed in individual children. METHODS: A prospective repeated measures study. Ten children with a median age of 7.6 months (range, 3-72 months) diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma were examined. Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions were acquired from both ears of the children with 65/55 dB SPL primary tones (f(2)=793-7996 Hz) and a frequency resolution of 3 points/octave. Distortion-product otoacoustic emission levels in dB SPL were measured before chemotherapy treatment (baseline measurement) and after 3-4 courses of chemotherapy (interim measurement). Comparisons were made between baseline and interim distortion-product otoacoustic emission levels (collapsed across ears). Evidence of ototoxicity was based on criterion reductions (>/= 6 dB) in distortion-product otoacoustic emission levels. RESULTS: Significant differences between baseline and interim mean distortion-product otoacoustic emission levels were only observed at f(2) = 7996 Hz. Four children exhibited criterion reductions in distortion-product otoacoustic emission levels. CONCLUSIONS: Mean distortion-product otoacoustic emission levels at most frequencies were not changed following 3-4 courses of carboplatin chemotherapy in children with retinoblastoma. However, on an individual basis, children receiving higher doses of carboplatin exhibited criterion reductions in distortion-product otoacoustic emission level at several frequencies. These findings suggest that higher doses of carboplatin affect outer hair cell function, and distortion-product otoacoustic emission tests can provide useful information when monitoring children at risk of developing carboplatin ototoxicity.

Affiliation:Charles B. Stout Neuroscience Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, University of Tennessee-Memphis 38163.
Abstract:Fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in the B/E linked-field scan mode were used to quantify endogenous beta-endorphin (BE) in individual human pituitary extracts. The experimental protocol includes the addition of a stable isotope-labeled internal standard ((2H4-Ile22)BE1-31, human) to the tissue homogenate before extraction, purification of the native BE by a combination of Sep-Pak chromatography and gradient high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), trypsin digestion to cleave BE into smaller peptides, and separation of the tryptic fragment BE20-24 (NAIIK) by isocratic reversed-phase HPLC. Mass spectrometric quantification is based upon recording either (a) the [M + H]+ ions of NAIIK and its deuterated analog ((2H4)NAIIK), or (b) the transitions ([NAIIK + H](+)----[NAI]+) and [((2H4)NAIIK + H](+)----[(2H4)NAI]+) using the B/E linked-field scan. Linear calibration curves were obtained using these two mass spectrometric techniques from standard solutions containing 1.25-20 micrograms of BE; each standard solution also contained 10 micrograms of (2H4)BE. The amounts (means +/- s.d.) of endogenous BE in five separate human pituitaries were found to be 156 +/- 84 [( M + H]+ method) and 169 +/- 99 pmol mg-1 protein (MRM method).

Abstract:A convincing deceiver must act in discordance with their knowledge of the truth. To do so requires the deceiver to resolve competition between what is known to be true and what is intended to be false. We investigated the temporal signature of this competition by examining the action dynamics of arm movement while participants responded falsely or truthfully to autobiographical information. The participants answered no or yes by navigating a Nintendo Wii Remote to no and yes regions on a large projector screen. Trajectory analyses of the fine-grained arm movements show increased complexity in false responding relative to truthful responding, with the greatest difference in false yes answers. The dynamic motor movements also reveal greater strength of competition during the act of false responding, thereby extending traditional response time measures that capture latent competition alone. These results suggest that deceptive processes may be detectable when action is allowed to covary with thought. Supplemental figures and a list of the sentence stimuli may be downloaded from http://pbr.psychonomic-journals.org/content/supplemental.

Abstract:Cyclic phosphatidic acid (1-acyl-2,3-cyclic-glycerophosphate, CPA), one of nature's simplest phospholipids, is found in cells from slime mold to humans and has a largely unknown function. We find here that CPA is generated in mammalian cells in a stimulus-coupled manner by phospholipase D2 (PLD2) and binds to and inhibits the nuclear hormone receptor PPARgamma with nanomolar affinity and high specificity through stabilizing its interaction with the corepressor SMRT. CPA production inhibits the PPARgamma target-gene transcription that normally drives adipocytic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, lipid accumulation in RAW264.7 cells and primary mouse macrophages, and arterial wall remodeling in a rat model in vivo. Inhibition of PLD2 by shRNA, a dominant-negative mutant, or a small molecule inhibitor blocks CPA production and relieves PPARgamma inhibition. We conclude that CPA is a second messenger and a physiological inhibitor of PPARgamma, revealing that PPARgamma is regulated by endogenous agonists as well as by antagonists.

Title:Structural and functional predictors of drop vertical jump.
Authors:['Ferreira LC', 'Weiss LW', 'Hammond KG', 'Schilling BK']
Affiliation:Musculoskeletal Dynamics Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:This investigation was designed to determine if relatively small manipulations of squat load and the inclusion of selected morphologic variables might augment the explained variance in vertical jump (VJ) displacement. Fifty-two university students (27 women and 25 men) with weight training experience served as subjects. All were assessed for body fat percentage (BF%), height, body weight (BW), leg length (LL), ankle range of motion, and quadriceps angle (Q-angle). Additionally, subjects performed drop vertical jumps (DVJs) and both countermovement jump (CMJ) squats and static jump (SJ) squats at 20, 30, and 40% of their back squat 1 repetition maximum (1RM). A preliminary analysis revealed that DVJcm for all subjects (28.1 +/- 6.64; mean +/- SD) was most highly correlated with both CMJ @ 30% 1RM (CMJ30PP) and SJ @ 20% 1RM (SJ20PP) (r = 0.84, p < 0.001). Forced multiple regression was then used to determine which variables contributed to VJ displacement. The greatest variability explained (83%) used a CMJ: DVJcm = 20.311 + (0.008) (CMJ30PP) - (0.346) (BW). When the same variables were used to calculate separate gender-based regressions, the explained variance in DVJcm (men = 33.0 +/- 5.34 cm; women = 23.4 +/- 3.79 cm) was 68% for men and 64% for women. These findings suggest that jump squat peak power at a light load is a good predictor of VJ and that its training-induced augmentation would likely improve VJ. The addition of BW to the equation explained slightly more variability in DVJcm than in BF%. Because excess amounts of either would be an additional load to be moved against gravity (fat in general or skeletal muscle in the upper torso), it follows that relatively high levels of either might be expected to attenuate VJ performance.

Title:A critical review of naphthalene sources and exposures relevant to indoor and outdoor air.
Authors:['Jia C', 'Batterman S']
Affiliation:School of Public Health, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA. cjia@memphis.edu
Abstract:Both the recent classification of naphthalene as a possible human carcinogen and its ubiquitous presence motivate this critical review of naphthalene's sources and exposures. We evaluate the environmental literature on naphthalene published since 1990, drawing on nearly 150 studies that report emissions and concentrations in indoor, outdoor and personal air. While naphthalene is both a volatile organic compound and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, concentrations and exposures are poorly characterized relative to many other pollutants. Most airborne emissions result from combustion, and key sources include industry, open burning, tailpipe emissions, and cigarettes. The second largest source is off-gassing, specifically from naphthalene's use as a deodorizer, repellent and fumigant. In the U.S., naphthalene's use as a moth repellant has been reduced in favor of para-dichlorobenzene, but extensive use continues in mothballs, which appears responsible for some of the highest indoor exposures, along with off-label uses. Among the studies judged to be representative, average concentrations ranged from 0.18 to 1.7 microg m(-3) in non-smoker's homes, and from 0.02 to 0.31 microg m(-3) outdoors in urban areas. Personal exposures have been reported in only three European studies. Indoor sources are the major contributor to (non-occupational) exposure. While its central tendencies fall well below guideline levels relevant to acute health impacts, several studies have reported maximum concentrations exceeding 100 microg m(-3), far above guideline levels. Using current but draft estimates of cancer risks, naphthalene is a major environmental risk driver, with typical individual risk levels in the 10(-4) range, which is high and notable given that millions of individuals are exposed. Several factors influence indoor and outdoor concentrations, but the literature is inconsistent on their effects. Further investigation is needed to better characterize naphthalene's sources and exposures, especially for indoor and personal measurements.

Title:Partitioning of star branched polymers into pores at three chromatography conditions.

Abstract:The partitioning of star branched polymers into a slit pore at three different chromatography conditions, namely, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), liquid chromatography at the critical condition (LCCC), and liquid adsorption chromatography (LAC) have been investigated with lattice Monte Carlo simulations. Two different chain models are used: random walks (RW) that have no excluded volume interaction and self-avoiding walks (SAW) that have excluded volume interaction. The simulation data obtained for the two chain models are compared to illustrate the effect of excluded volume interactions on the partitioning of star branched polymers. The two most outstanding effects observed due to the introduction of excluded volume interactions are: (i) stars with a high number of arms can be excluded from the pore at condition corresponding to the LCCC of the linear polymers; (ii) the partition coefficient of stars in LAC mode is not dependent only on the total number of monomers on the chain. These effects illustrated by the current study should be taken into account when interpreting experimental chromatography data for branched polymers.

Title:Biomechanical effects of autonomous augmentation on the adjacent unaugmented vertebral bodies: influence of the number of functional spinal units in a finite element model.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Xu J']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee - USA.
Abstract:PURPOSE: The results of finite element analysis (FEA) studies on the effect of augmentation of one vertebral body (VB), using vertebroplasty (VP) or balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), on the biomechanics of the adjacent and nonadjacent VBs are contradictory. One reason for this record is that different levels of the spine, numbers of structures, and numbers of functional spinal units (FSUs) (X) were included in the models used in different studies. The purpose of the present study was to clarify this effect as far as X is concerned. METHODS: A validated three-dimensional solid model of the lumbar spine was constructed from computed tomography scans and prophylactic augmentation of L2 was simulated. In the FEA, the model was subjected to a uniformly distributed compressive load (total load = 1300 N) on the superior endplate of L1. The extent to which a change in X affects the values of the mean von Mises stress (sigmaVM) and the mean elastic strain energy density (ESED) in all structures adjacent to L2 was determined. (These changes were with respect to the case where all the VBs in the model are intact.) RESULTS: As X increased (from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, and from 3 to 4), there were clear variations in the number of stable changes in both sigmaVM and ESED in each structure. The largest number of these changes occurred when X changed from 2 to 3. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that three is the number of FSUs that should be included in models of the lumbar spine to be used in FEA studies of VP and BKP.

Title:A room-temperature autonomically-healing PMMA bone cement: influence of composition on fatigue crack propagation rate.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Wellborn B', 'Jones Ii L', 'Biggs P']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee - USA.
Abstract:PURPOSE: To test two hypotheses. First, autonomic healing is achievable in a commercially available poly (methyl methacrylate) bone cement brand that is widely used to anchor total joint replacements. Secondly, in this self-healing cement, the fatigue crack propagation (FCP) rate is critically dependent on the relative amount of the mass of the healing agent (endo-isomer of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) embedded in poly (urea-formaldehyde) (PUF) microcapsules (diameter = 226 plusmn; 51 mu;m)) (MDM) to that of the catalyst (a first-generation Grubbsrsquo; catalyst) (MGC). (Note that, in this work, the term, ldquo;autonomic healingrdquo; or ldquo;self healingrdquo;, refers to the ability of the material, after having been damaged during service, due to formation of cracks, for example, to restore its initial mechanical performance without the need for any external intervention). METHODS: The strategy that was developed by White et al. for room-temperature autonomic healing of a neat polymeric material was used. The DCPD-filled PUF microcapsules and the catalyst were blended with the cementrsquo;s powder in a mortar bowl using a polymeric spatula, and the blended powder mixture and the cementrsquo;s liquid monomer were mixed under a partial vacuum. FCP tests were performed on specimens of seven study groups: the control cement (CMWTM1), four sets having different values of MDM/MGC, one set in which only the DCPD-filled microcapsules were blended with the CMWTM1 powder, and one set in which only the Grubbsrsquo; catalyst was blended with the CMWTM1 powder. RESULTS: An index of the self-healing achieved, as computed using the estimated FCP rates, was within the range reported in the literature for autonomically-healing neat polymeric materials. Furthermore, the variation of the estimated FCP rate with MDM/MGC suggests that changes in this rate is critically dependent on change of MDM/MGC. CONCLUSION: The results supported both of the study hypotheses.

Title:Efferent-induced change in human cochlear compression and its influence on masking of tones.

Abstract:Several lines of evidence suggest that medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent neurons modify cochlear output to improve signal detection in noise. In animal models, stimulation of MOC efferents reduces the amount of compression in basilar membrane (BM) growth functions. Linearization of BM growth functions may assist in extending the neural response to the signal above that of noise, leading to a decrease in masking. In order to test this hypothesis, effects of MOC efferent neurons on BM compression were studied indirectly in humans by examining the effects of contralateral noise on distortion-product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) input-output functions at 1.0 and 2.0kHz. Compression threshold estimates from a three-segment linear regression model applied to the DPOAE functions were derived in order to determine correlations with psychophysical measurements of masking of tones at 1.0 and 2.0kHz. Contralateral noise shifted the DPOAE compression threshold to a significantly higher level at 1.0kHz, but not at 2.0kHz. A significant negative correlation between the change in DPOAE compression threshold and the amount of masking at 1.0kHz was observed, but no correlation between these variables was detected at 2.0kHz. The results of this experiment at the lower test frequency indicated that contralateral noise linearized DPOAE input-output functions, and individuals with larger DPOAE compression threshold shifts tended to exhibit less masking. Under certain conditions, decreases in cochlear compression induced by MOC efferent neurons may lead to unmasking of tones presented in noise.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Dietary modification via caloric restriction is associated with multiple effects related to improved metabolic and cardiovascular health. However, a mandated reduction in kilocalories is not well-tolerated by many individuals, limiting the long-term application of such a plan. The Daniel Fast is a widely utilized fast based on the Biblical book of Daniel. It involves a 21 day ad libitum food intake period, devoid of animal products and preservatives, and inclusive of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. The purpose of the present study was to determine the efficacy of the Daniel Fast to improve markers of metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk. METHODS: 43 subjects (13 men; 30 women; 35 +/- 1 yrs; range: 20-62 yrs) completed a 21 day period of modified food intake in accordance with detailed guidelines provided by investigators. All subjects purchased and prepared their own food. Following initial screening, subjects were given one week to prepare for the fast, after which time they reported to the lab for their pre-intervention assessment (day 1). After the 21 day fast, subjects reported to the lab for their post-intervention assessment (day 22). For both visits, subjects reported in a 12 hr fasted state, performing no strenuous physical activity during the preceding 24-48 hrs. At each visit, mental and physical health (SF-12 form), resting heart rate and blood pressure, and anthropometric variables were measured. Blood was collected for determination of complete blood count, metabolic panel, lipid panel, insulin, HOMA-IR, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Subjects' self-reported compliance, mood, and satiety in relation to the fast were also recorded. Diet records were maintained by all subjects during the 7 day period immediately prior to the fast (usual intake) and during the final 7 days of the fast. RESULTS: Subjects' compliance to the fast was 98.7 +/- 0.2% (mean +/- SEM). Using a 10 point scale, subjects' mood and satiety were both 7.9 +/- 0.2. The following variables were significantly (p < 0.05) lower following the fast as compared to before the fast: white blood cell count (5.68 +/- 0.24 vs. 4.99 +/- 0.19 103.muL-1), blood urea nitrogen (13.07 +/- 0.58 vs. 10.14 +/- 0.59 mg.dL-1), blood urea nitrogen/creatinine (14.74 +/- 0.59 vs. 11.67 +/- 0.68), protein (6.95 +/- 0.07 vs. 6.77 +/- 0.06 g.dL-1), total cholesterol (171.07 +/- 4.57 vs. 138.69 +/- 4.39 mg.dL-1), LDL-C (98.38 +/- 3.89 vs. 76.07 +/- 3.53 mg.dL-1), HDL-C (55.65 +/- 2.50 vs. 47.58 +/- 2.19 mg.dL-1), SBP (114.65 +/- 2.34 vs. 105.93 +/- 2.12 mmHg), and DBP (72.23 +/- 1.59 vs. 67.00 +/- 1.43 mmHg). Insulin (4.42 +/- 0.52 vs. 3.37 +/- 0.35 muU.mL-1; p = 0.10), HOMA-IR (0.97 +/- 0.13 vs.0.72 +/- 0.08; p = 0.10), and CRP (3.15 +/- 0.91 vs. 1.60 +/- 0.42 mg.L-1; p = 0.13), were lowered to a clinically meaningful, albeit statistically insignificant extent. No significant difference was noted for any anthropometric variable (p > 0.05). As expected, multiple differences in dietary intake were noted (p < 0.05), including a reduction in total kilocalorie intake (2185 +/- 94 vs. 1722 +/- 85). CONCLUSION: A 21 day period of modified dietary intake in accordance with the Daniel Fast is 1) well-tolerated by men and women and 2) improves several risk factors for metabolic and cardiovascular disease. Larger scale, randomized studies, inclusive of a longer time period and possibly a slight modification in food choice in an attempt to maintain HDL cholesterol, are needed to extend these findings.

Abstract:Reports indicate that toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) based primarily on rodent data do not accurately predict in vitro human responsiveness to certain dioxin-like chemicals (DLCs). To investigate this in cells responsive to dioxins and relevant to chloracne, normal human epidermal keratinocytes were treated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and several DLCs, each with a TEF value of 0.1, representing three classes of congeners. We estimated half maximal effective concentration (EC50)-based donor-specific relative potency (REP) values for cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) messenger RNA (mRNA) induction for TCDD, 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HxCDD), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF), 1,2,3,6,7,8-hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF), and 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB 126). We also determined EC50-based population-level REP values (n = 4) for CYP1A1 mRNA induction for TCDD, HxCDF, and PCB 126. Furthermore, an alternative factor, the relative threshold factor (RTF) based on the low end (threshold) of the dose-response curve, was calculated. Our results demonstrated that HxCDF had a population-based REP value of 0.98, 9.8-fold higher than its assigned TEF value of 0.1. Conversely, PCB 126 had an REP value of 0.0027 and an RTF of 0.0022, 37-fold and 45-fold less than its assigned TEF of 0.1, respectively. The REP values for HxCDD and TCDF were 0.24 and 0.10, respectively, similar to their assigned value of 0.1. Therefore, although the DLCs tested in the current study all possessed the same assigned TEF value of 0.1, congener-specific differences in REPs and RTFs were observed for human keratinocytes. These congener-specific discrepancies are likely because of differences in interspecies factors that have yet to be defined.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES: This study examined the levels of genetic knowledge, health literacy and beliefs about causation of health conditions among individuals in different age groups. METHODS: Individuals (n = 971) recruited through 8 community health centers in Suffolk County, New York, completed a one-time survey. RESULTS: Levels of genetic knowledge were lower among individuals in older age groups (26-35, p = 0.011; 36-49, p = 0.002; 50 years and older, p<0.001) compared to those in the youngest age group (18-25). Participants in the oldest age group also had lower health literacy than those in the youngest group (p <0.001). Those in the oldest group were more likely to endorse genetic (OR = 1.87, p = 0.008) and less likely to endorse behavioral factors like diet, exercise and smoking (OR = 0.55, p = 0.010) as causes of a person's body weight than those in the youngest group. Higher levels of genetic knowledge were associated with higher likelihood of behavioral attribution for body weight (OR = 1.25, p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Providing additional information that compensates for their lower genetic knowledge may help individuals in older age groups benefit from rapidly emerging genetic health information more fully. Increasing the levels of genetic knowledge about common complex diseases may help motivate individuals to engage in health promoting behaviors to maintain healthy weight through increases in behavioral causal attributions.

Title:Probabilistic characteristics of random damage events and their quantification in acrylic bone cement.

Abstract:The failure of brittle and quasi-brittle polymers can be attributed to a multitude of random microscopic damage modes, such as fibril breakage, crazing, and microfracture. As the load increases, new damage modes appear, and existing ones can transition into others. In the example polymer used in this study--a commercially available acrylic bone cement--these modes, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy of fracture surfaces, include nucleation of voids, cracking, and local detachment of the beads from the matrix. Here, we made acoustic measurements of the randomly generated microscopic events (RGME) that occurred in the material under pure tension and under three-point bending, and characterized the severity of the damage by the entropy (s) of the probability distribution of the observed acoustic signal amplitudes. We correlated s with the applied stress (sigma) by establishing an empirical s-sigma relationship, which quantifies the activities of RGME under Mode I stress. It reveals the state of random damage modes: when ds/dsigma > 0, the number of damage modes present increases with increasing stress, whereas it decreases when ds/dsigma < 0. When ds/dsigma approximately 0, no new random damage modes occur. In the s-sigma curve, there exists a transition zone, with the stress at the "knee point" in this zone (center of the zone) corresponding to ~30 and ~35% of the cement's tensile and bending strengths, respectively. This finding explains the effects of RGME on material fatigue performance and may be used to approximate fatigue limit.

Title:CBP/p300 double null cells reveal effect of coactivator level and diversity on CREB transactivation.

Abstract:It remains uncertain how the DNA sequence of mammalian genes influences the transcriptional response to extracellular signals. Here, we show that the number of CREB-binding sites (CREs) affects whether the related histone acetyltransferases (HATs) CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 are required for endogenous gene transcription. Fibroblasts with both CBP and p300 knocked-out had strongly attenuated histone H4 acetylation at CREB-target genes in response to cyclic-AMP, yet transcription was not uniformly inhibited. Interestingly, dependence on CBP/p300 was often different between reporter plasmids and endogenous genes. Transcription in the absence of CBP/p300 correlated with endogenous genes having more CREs, more bound CREB, and more CRTC2 (a non-HAT coactivator of CREB). Indeed, CRTC2 rescued cAMP-inducible expression for certain genes in CBP/p300 null cells and contributed to the CBP/p300-independent expression of other targets. Thus, endogenous genes with a greater local concentration and diversity of coactivators tend to have more resilient-inducible expression. This model suggests how gene expression patterns could be tuned by altering coactivator availability rather than by changing signal input or transcription factor levels.

Abstract:Spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR). This mutation confers toxic function to AR through unknown mechanisms. Mutant AR toxicity requires binding of its hormone ligand, suggesting that pathogenesis involves ligand-induced changes in AR. However, whether toxicity is mediated by native AR function or a novel AR function is unknown. We systematically investigated events downstream of ligand-dependent AR activation in a Drosophila model of SBMA. We show that nuclear translocation of AR is necessary, but not sufficient, for toxicity and that DNA binding by AR is necessary for toxicity. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that a functional AF-2 domain is essential for toxicity, a finding corroborated by a genetic screen that identified AF-2 interactors as dominant modifiers of degeneration. These findings indicate that SBMA pathogenesis is mediated by misappropriation of native protein function, a mechanism that may apply broadly to polyglutamine diseases.

Title:Lower postprandial oxidative stress in women compared with men.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ', 'Fisher-Wellman KH']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that oxidative stress is increased following intake of a high-fat meal, mediated in large part by the triglyceride (TG) response to feeding as well as fasting oxidative stress values. It has been suggested that women may process TG more efficiently after high-fat meals, based on the antilipidemic properties of estrogen. It has also been reported that women present with lower fasting oxidative stress values than do men. It is possible that women experience attenuated postprandial oxidative stress compared with men. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the postprandial TG and oxidative stress response after a lipid meal in healthy men and women. METHODS: This study was conducted at The University of Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee, from October to December 2008. Blood samples were collected before (in a 10-hour fasted state), and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after ingestion of a lipid load (heavy whipping cream at 1 g . kg(-1)). Blood samples were analyzed for TG, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), and nitrate/nitrite (NOx). The AUC was calculated for each variable and results were compared using a t test. Effect-size calculations were performed using Cohen's d. RESULTS: Samples from 10 men and 10 women, aged 18 to 47 years (17 subjects aged <37 years), were compared. AUC data were not significantly different for TG (mean [SEM] 330 [48] vs 354 [34] mg . dL(-1) . 6h(-1) for men and women, respectively; effect size = 0.09) or NOx (165 [25] vs 152 [17] mumol . L(-1) . 6h(-1) for men and women; effect size = 0.09). However, significant differences were noted for MDA (10.7 [1.3] vs 6.1 [0.5] mumol . L(-1) . 6h(-1) for men and women, respectively; P = 0.002; effect size = 0.61) and H(2)O(2) (154 [23] vs 86 [8] mumol . L(-1) . 6h(-1) for men and women; P = 0.013; effect size = 0.53). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that women experience lower oxidative stress than do men, with regard to MDA and H(2)O(2), after ingestion of a lipid load in the form of heavy whipping cream. Considering the strong association between oxidative stress and cardiovascular disease, lower postprandial oxidative stress may be one mechanism associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease in women compared with men. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Abstract:Nitric oxide dietary supplements are extremely popular within the sport and bodybuilding community. Most products contain l-arginine, for which there is no direct evidence that oral L-arginine increases circulating nitric oxide or blood flow. A new molecule (2-[nitrooxy]thyl 2-amino-3-methylbutanoate) is being marketed as a sport supplement for purposes of delivering "real nitric oxide" to the circulation. In the present study, we measured the acute effects of this supplement on blood nitrate/nitrite and hemodynamic variables. Ten resistance trained men (26 +/- 4 years old; 8 +/- 6 years of resistance exercise training) reported to the laboratory in random order after a 10-hour overnight fast on 2 occasions separated by 1 week and were provided the supplement (2-[nitrooxy]ethyl 2-amino-3-methylbutanoate) or placebo. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded, and venous blood samples were collected before and at 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes after complete breakdown of the supplement (5 minutes post intake) or placebo. Blood samples were assayed for plasma nitrate/nitrite. No interaction (p = 0.99), condition (p = 0.18), or time (p = 0.98) effects were noted for plasma nitrate/nitrite, with values remaining nearly identical across time for placebo ( approximately 27 mumol.L(-1)) and increasing a maximum of approximately 6.7% (from 32.9 to 35.1 mumol.L(-1)) at the 15-minute collection period for the supplement. In regards to hemodynamic variables, no interaction, condition, or time effects were noted for heart rate, systolic, or diastolic blood pressure (p > 0.05), with values near identical between conditions and virtually unchanged across time. These findings indicate that 2-(nitrooxy)ethyl 2-amino-3-methylbutanoate has a small effect on increasing circulating nitrate/nitrite and does not cause any change in hemodynamic variables within the 1 hour postingestion period in a sample of resistance trained men.

Title:The effect of Glisson's capsule on the superficial elasticity measurements of the liver.
Authors:['Roan E']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Memphis, 330 Engineering Technology Building, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:In the past decade, novel tools for surgical planning and disease diagnosis have been developed to detect the liver's mechanical properties. Some tools utilize superficial indentation type measurements to determine the elasticity of the liver parenchyma and to assume material homogeneity. In fact, the liver is a soft tissue covered with a connective sheathing that is called Glisson's capsule. This article quantifies the effect of this capsule on the measured or "effective" elastic modulus obtained by indentation with a spherical geometry. Two sets of parametric computational studies in which the Glisson capsule thickness and elasticity were varied, demonstrated the relationship between the measured elastic response and the underlying parenchymal elastic response. Previously reported in vivo indentation data on the human liver were utilized to determine the elasticity of its parenchyma. The results indicated a linear relationship between the effective (measured) elastic response and the underlying parenchyma for the Glisson capsule thicknesses considered. When previously published human liver indentation data were analyzed, the measured elastic modulus was nearly 6.9% greater than the underlying parenchyma elastic modulus. Although the analyzed data were obtained from a single liver and yet displayed a significant variation, the Glisson capsule elasticity induced a significant but systematic error as well. The Glisson capsule thickness error was negligible for capsule parameters associated with a normal liver. Based on this work, an emphasis on the Glisson capsule's contribution to the mechanical response of the liver would enhance the clinical potential of indentation-based novel tools for liver care.

Abstract:In the past decade waterpipe (WP) smoking (a.k.a. hookah, shisha, and narghile) has been steadily spreading among the youth around the world. The allure of this tobacco use method for the youth can stem from its pleasant smooth smoke, social ambience and the perception of reduced harm. The material in this review is based on detailed Medline search for articles appearing especially in the past two years that are of relevance to WP epidemiology, health and addictive effects, and WP-related tobacco control policies. It shows that WP smoking is continuing to spread among the youth worldwide, and perhaps represents the second global tobacco epidemic since the cigarette. Available evidence suggests that the prevalence of current (past month) WP smoking range from 6 to 34% among Middle Eastern adolescents, 5%-17% among American adolescents, and that WP use is increasing globally. Studies on the health effects of WP smoking are limited by methodological quality, as well as by the novelty of WP epidemic relative to the long latency of important smoking-related health outcomes. Still, research indicates substantial WP harmful effects similar to those of cigarettes, as well as to the potential of providing a bridge to cigarette smoking or relapse. Developing effective interventions to curb WP use among the youth requires a detailed understanding of how dependence develops in WP users, and how it is shaped by WP's unique features such as the following; the predominantly intermittent use with prolonged sessions, preparation time, accessibility, potent sensory cues, and convivial experience of group use. It also requires assessing effective policy options such as factual and visible health warnings on all its parts, as well as youth access and indoor smoking restrictions. WP smoking is currently showing all signs of a burgeoning global epidemic with serious implications for public health and tobacco control worldwide. Investment in research and policy initiatives to understand and curb WP use needs to become a public health priority.

Title:Current views on the function of the lymphatic vasculature in health and disease.
Authors:['Wang Y', 'Oliver G']
Affiliation:Department of Genetics and Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.
Abstract:The lymphatic vascular system is essential for lipid absorption, fluid homeostasis, and immune surveillance. Until recently, lymphatic vessel dysfunction had been associated with symptomatic pathologic conditions such as lymphedema. Work in the last few years had led to a better understanding of the functional roles of this vascular system in health and disease. Furthermore, recent work has also unraveled additional functional roles of the lymphatic vasculature in fat metabolism, obesity, inflammation, and the regulation of salt storage in hypertension. In this review, we summarize the functional roles of the lymphatic vasculature in health and disease.

Title:Preference for one or two hearing AIDS among adult patients.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES: Most practitioners believe that use of two hearing aids is the ideal fitting for adults with bilateral symmetrical hearing loss. However, previous research has consistently shown that a substantial proportion of these patients actually prefer to use only one hearing aid. This study explored whether this pattern of preferences is seen with technologically advanced hearing aids. In addition, a selection of variables that were available prefitting were used to attempt to predict which patients will prefer one hearing aid rather than two. DESIGN: The study was designed as a 12-week field trial including structured and unstructured use of one and two hearing aids. Ninety-four subjects with mild to moderate bilaterally symmetrical hearing loss were bilaterally fit with 2005-2007 era hearing aids. Potential predictors included demographic, audiometric, auditory lifestyle, personality, and binaural processing variables. After the field trial, each subject stated his or her preference for one or two hearing aids and completed three self-report outcome questionnaires for their preferred fitting. RESULTS: Previous research was confirmed with modern technology hearing aids: after the field trial, 46% of the subjects preferred to use one hearing aid rather than two. Subjects who preferred two hearing aids tended to report better real-world outcomes than those who preferred one. Subjects who reported more hearing problems in daily life, who experienced more binaural loudness summation, and whose ears were more equivalent in dichotic listening were more likely to prefer to use two hearing aids. Contrary to conventional wisdom (ideas that are generally accepted as true), audiometric hearing loss and auditory lifestyle were not predictive of aiding preference. However, the best predictive approach from these data yielded accurate predictions for only two-thirds of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based practice calls for a conscientious melding of current evidence, clinical judgment, and patient preferences. The results of this research challenge practitioners to recognize that many patients who seem to be ideal candidates for bilateral aiding will actually prefer to wear only one hearing aid. Furthermore, at this time, there is no accurate method that will predict which patients will prefer one hearing aid rather than two. At present, the most effective approach open to practitioners would be to conduct a candid unbiased systematic field trial allowing each patient to compare unilateral and bilateral fittings in daily life. This might necessitate more fitting sessions and could perhaps add to the practitioner's burden. This downside should be weighed against the additional patient satisfaction that can be anticipated as a result of transparency in the fitting protocol, collaboration with the patient in the treatment decisions, and the knowledge of selecting the most cost-effective patient-centered solution.

Title:Discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine and amphetamine in rats following developmental exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

Abstract:Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental neurotoxicants known to affect the brain dopaminergic (DA) system. This project investigated whether developmental exposure to PCBs would alter the discriminative stimulus effects of psychostimulant drugs known to act on the DA system. Female Long-Evans rats were orally exposed to 0, 3, or 6 mg/kg/day of an environmentally relevant PCB mixture from four weeks prior to breeding through weaning of their litters on PND 21. When they reached adulthood one male and female/litter were trained to discriminate cocaine (10.0 mg/kg, IP) from saline by repeatedly pairing cocaine injections with reinforcement on one operant response lever, and saline injections with reinforcement on the other lever. After response training, generalization tests to four lower doses of cocaine (7.5, 5.0, 2.5, and 1.25 mg/kg, IP) and to amphetamine (1.0, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 mg/kg, IP) were given two days/week, with additional training dose days in-between. Percent responding of the PCB-exposed rats on the cocaine-paired lever was significantly higher than that of controls for the highest generalization dose of cocaine, and lower than that of controls for the highest dose of amphetamine. Response rate and percent responding on the cocaine lever did not differ among the exposure groups on the days when the training dose of cocaine was given, suggesting that the generalization test results were not due to pre-existing differences in discrimination ability or rate of responding. These findings suggest that developmental PCB exposure can alter the interoceptive cues of psychostimulants.

Title:Inherited germline TP53 mutation encodes a protein with an aberrant C-terminal motif in a case of pediatric adrenocortical tumor.

Abstract:Childhood adrenocortical tumor (ACT), a very rare malignancy, has an annual worldwide incidence of about 0.3 per million children younger than 15 years. The association between inherited germline mutations of the TP53 gene and an increased predisposition to ACT was described in the context of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome. In fact, about two-thirds of children with ACT have a TP53 mutation. However, less than 10% of pediatric ACT cases occur in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, suggesting that inherited low-penetrance TP53 mutations play an important role in pediatric adrenal cortex tumorigenesis. We identified a novel inherited germline TP53 mutation affecting the acceptor splice site at intron 10 in a child with an ACT and no family history of cancer. The lack of family history of cancer and previous information about the carcinogenic potential of the mutation led us to further characterize it. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the non-natural and highly hydrophobic C-terminal segment of the frame-shifted mutant p53 protein may disrupt its tumor suppressor function by causing misfolding and aggregation. Our findings highlight the clinical and genetic counseling dilemmas that arise when an inherited TP53 mutation is found in a child with ACT without relatives with Li-Fraumeni-component tumors.

Title:Yap1 activation by H2O2 or thiol-reactive chemicals elicits distinct adaptive gene responses.

Abstract:The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Yap1 mediates an adaptive response to oxidative stress by regulating protective genes. H(2)O(2) activates Yap1 through the Gpx3-mediated formation of a Yap1 Cys303-Cys598 intramolecular disulfide bond. Thiol-reactive electrophiles can activate Yap1 directly by adduction to cysteine residues in the C-terminal domain containing Cys598, Cys620, and Cys629. H(2)O(2) and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) showed no cross-protection against each other, whereas another thiol-reactive chemical, acrolein, elicited Yap1-dependent cross-protection against NEM, but not H(2)O(2). Either Cys620 or Cys629 was sufficient for activation of Yap1 by NEM or acrolein; Cys598 was dispensable for this activation mechanism. To determine whether Yap1 activated by H(2)O(2) or thiol-reactive chemicals elicits distinct adaptive gene responses, microarray analysis was performed on the wild-type strain or its isogenic single-deletion strain Deltayap1 treated with control buffer, H(2)O(2), NEM, or acrolein. Sixty-five unique H(2)O(2) and 327 NEM and acrolein Yap1-dependent responsive genes were identified. Functional analysis using single-gene-deletion yeast strains demonstrated that protection was conferred by CTA1 and CTT1 in the H(2)O(2)-responsive subset and YDR042C in the NEM- and acrolein-responsive subset. These findings demonstrate that the distinct mechanisms of Yap1 activation by H(2)O(2) or thiol-reactive chemicals result in selective expression of protective genes.

Abstract:The proposed DSM-V changes related to the pathological gambling diagnosis hold far-reaching implications, yet these modifications have been met with little public attention. This letter addresses the three changes proposed including the diagnosis' reclassification alongside other addictive behaviors, the lowering of the pathological gambling threshold to the endorsement of 4 symptoms, and the removal of the "illegal acts" criterion. Support for the initial change is well documented, but there is evidence to suggest that the latter two changes should be reconsidered.

Title:Lack of effect of a high-calorie dextrose or maltodextrin meal on postprandial oxidative stress in healthy young men.
Authors:['Fisher-Wellman KH', 'Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Carbohydrate powder in the form of maltodextrin is widely used by athletes for postexercise glycogen resynthesis. There is some concern that such a practice may be associated with a postprandial rise in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species production and subsequent oxidation of macromolecules. This is largely supported by findings of increased oxidative-stress biomarkers and associated endothelial dysfunction after intake of dextrose. PURPOSE: To compare the effects of isocaloric dextrose and maltodextrin meals on blood glucose, triglycerides (TAG), and oxidative-stress biomarkers in a sample of young healthy men. METHODS: 10 men consumed isocaloric dextrose and maltodextrin powder drinks (2.25 g/kg) in a random-order, crossover design. Blood samples were collected premeal (fasting) and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hr postmeal and assayed for glucose, TAG, malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, nitrate/nitrite, and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity. RESULTS: Significant meal effects were noted for glucose total area under the curve (p=.004), with values higher for the dextrose meal. No other statistically significant meal effects were noted (p>.05). With respect to the 2 (meal)x5 (time) ANOVA, no significant interaction, time, or meal effects were noted for any variable (p>.05), with the exception of glucose, for which a main effect for both meal (p<.0001) and time (p=.0002) was noted. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that carbohydrate meals, consumed as either dextrose or maltodextrin, pose little postprandial oxidative insult to young, healthy men. As such, there should be minimal concern over such feedings, even at high dosages, assuming adequate glucose metabolism.

Abstract:Background. Resistance training research has demonstrated positive effects for persons with Parkinson's disease (PD), but the number of acute training variables that can be manipulated makes it difficult to determine the optimal resistance training program. Objective. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the effects of an 8-week resistance training intervention on strength and function in persons with PD. Methods. Eighteen men and women were randomized to training or standard care for the 8-week intervention. The training group performed 3 sets of 5-8 repetitions of the leg press, leg curl, and calf press twice weekly. Tests included leg press strength relative to body mass, timed up-and-go, six-minute walk, and Activities-specific Balance Confidence questionnaire. Results. There was a significant group-by-time effect for maximum leg press strength relative to body mass, with the training group significantly increasing their maximum relative strength (P < .05). No other significant interactions were noted (P > .05). Conclusions. Moderate volume, high-load weight training is effective for increasing lower-body strength in persons with PD.

Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of a dietary supplement (Ambrotose AO(R)) on resting and exercise-induced blood antioxidant capacity and oxidative stress in exercise-trained and untrained men and women. METHODS: 25 individuals (7 trained and 5 untrained men; 7 trained and 6 untrained women) received Ambrotose AO(R) (4 capsules per day = 2 grams per day) or a placebo for 3 weeks in a random order, double blind cross-over design (with a 3 week washout period). Blood samples were collected at rest, and at 0 and 30 minutes following a graded exercise treadmill test (GXT) performed to exhaustion, both before and after each 3 week supplementation period. Samples were analyzed for Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC), Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and nitrate/nitrite (NOx). Quality of life was assessed using the SF-12 form and exercise time to exhaustion was recorded. Resting blood samples were analyzed for complete blood count (CBC), metabolic panel, and lipid panel before and after each 3 week supplementation period. Dietary intake during the week before each exercise test was recorded. RESULTS: No condition effects were noted for SF-12 data, for GXT time to exhaustion, or for any variable within the CBC, metabolic panel, or lipid panel (p > 0.05). Treatment with Ambrotose AO(R) resulted in an increase in resting levels of TEAC (p = 0.02) and ORAC (p < 0.0001). No significant change was noted in resting levels of MDA, H2O2, or NOx (p > 0.05). Exercise resulted in an acute increase in TEAC, MDA, and H2O2 (p < 0.05), all which were higher at 0 minutes post exercise compared to pre exercise (p < 0.05). No condition effects were noted for exercise related data (p > 0.05), with the exception of ORAC (p = 0.0005) which was greater at 30 minutes post exercise for Ambrotose AO(R) compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Ambrotose AO(R) at a daily dosage of 4 capsules per day increases resting blood antioxidant capacity and may enhance post exercise antioxidant capacity. However, no statistically detected difference is observed in resting or exercise-induced oxidative stress biomarkers, in quality of life, or in GXT time to exhaustion.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a 2-year obesity prevention program in African American girls. DESIGN: Memphis GEMS (Girls' health Enrichment Multi-site Studies) was a controlled trial in which girls were randomly assigned to an obesity prevention program or alternative intervention. SETTING: Local community centers and YWCAs (Young Women's Christian Associations) in Memphis, Tennessee. PARTICIPANTS: Girls aged 8 to 10 years (N = 303) who were identified by a parent or guardian as African American and who had a body mass index (BMI) at or higher than the 25th percentile for age or 1 parent with a BMI of 25 or higher. INTERVENTIONS: Group behavioral counseling to promote healthy eating and increased physical activity (obesity prevention program) or self-esteem and social efficacy (alternative intervention). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The BMI at 2 years. RESULTS: The BMI increased in all girls with no treatment effect (obesity prevention minus alternative intervention) at 2 years (mean, 0.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.40 to 0.58). Two-year treatment effects in the expected direction were observed for servings per day of sweetened beverages (mean, -0.19; 95% CI, -0.39 to 0.09), water (mean, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.40), and vegetables (mean, 0.15; 95% CI,-0.02 to 0.30), but there were no effects on physical activity. Post hoc analyses suggested a treatment effect in younger girls (P for interaction = .08). The mean BMI difference at 2 years was -2.41 (95% CI, -4.83 to 0.02) in girls initially aged 8 years and -1.02 (95% CI, -2.31 to 0.27) in those initially aged 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of significant BMI change at 2 years indicates that this intervention alone is insufficient for obesity prevention. Effectiveness may require more explicit behavior change goals and a stronger physical activity component as well as supportive changes in environmental contexts.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To compare the oxidative stress response following isocaloric consumption of a lipid, carbohydrate, protein, and mixed meal.

Blood samples were collected premeal and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours postmeal and assayed for various markers of oxidative stress, as well as triglycerides (TAG) and glucose. Total area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each variable, and a 4 x 5 analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to further analyze data. RESULTS: Significant meal effects were noted for hydrogen peroxide AUC (p = 0.004), with values higher for the lipid meal compared with all other meals (p < 0.05). Contrasts revealed greater AUC for TAG (p = 0.05), malondialdehyde (p = 0.002), and nitrate/nitrite (p = 0.02) for the lipid meal compared with the protein meal. With regard to the ANOVA, oxidative stress values were highest for the lipid meal and increased from 2-6 hours postmeal following lipid ingestion (p < 0.05). No other meals resulted in a significant increase in oxidative stress (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that when controlling for total dietary energy, a lipid meal results in the greatest increase in postprandial oxidative stress in a sample of young, healthy men.

Title:Autotaxin inhibitors: a perspective on initial medicinal chemistry efforts.
Authors:['Parrill AL', 'Baker DL']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Department of Chemistry, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. aparrill@memphis.edu
Abstract:The lysophospholipase D enzyme, autotaxin (ATX), has been linked to numerous human diseases including cancer, neurophatic pain, obesity and Alzheimer's disease. Although the ATX protein was initially purified and characterized in 1992, a link to bioactive lipid metabolism was not made until 2002. In the past decade, metal chelators, lysophospholipid product analogs, and more recently, small non-lipid inhibitors of the enzyme were successfully identified. The majority of these inhibitors have been characterized using recombinant purified ATX in vitro, with very few examples studied in more complex systems. Translation of ATX inhibitors from the hands of medicinal chemists to clinical use will require substantially expanded characterization of ATX inhibitors in vivo.

Abstract:Cyclic phosphatidic acid (CPA) is a naturally occurring analog of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in which the sn-2 hydroxy group forms a five-membered ring with the sn-3 phosphate. Here, we describe the synthesis of R-3-CCPA and S-3-CCPA along with their pharmacological properties as inhibitors of lysophospholipase D/autotaxin, agonists of the LPA(5) GPCR, and blockers of lung metastasis of B16-F10 melanoma cells in a C57BL/6 mouse model. S-3CCPA was significantly more efficacious in the activation of LPA(5) compared to the R-stereoisomer. In contrast, no stereoselective differences were found between the two isomers toward the inhibition of autotaxin or lung metastasis of B16-F10 melanoma cells in vivo. These results extend the potential utility of these compounds as potential lead compounds warranting evaluation as cancer therapeutics.

Abstract:The mechanical response of most soft tissue is considered to be viscohyperelastic, making the development of accurate constitutive models a challenging task. In this article, we present a constitutive model for bovine liver tissue that utilizes a viscous dissipation potential, and use it to model the response of bovine liver tissue at strain rates ranging from 0.001 to 0.04 s(-1). On the material modeling front of this study, the free energy is assumed to depend on the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, whereas a separate rate-dependent viscous potential is posited to characterize viscoelasticity. This viscous dissipation component is a function of the time rate of change of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor. On the experimental front, no-slip uniaxial compression experiments are conducted on bovine liver tissue at various strain rates. A numerical correction approach is used to account for the no-slip edge conditions, and the constitutive model is fit to the resulting corrected stress-strain data. The complete derivation of the material model, its implementation in the finite element software package ABAQUS, and a validation study are presented in this article. The results show that bovine liver tissue exhibits a strong strain-rate dependence even at the low strain rates considered here and that the proposed constitutive model is able to accurately describe this response.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: This study examined the role of demographic characteristics, psychological factors, and family functioning on attendance in a randomized controlled trial of a family-based pediatric obesity program. METHOD: Participants included 155 children between the ages of 4 and 7 years (M age = 5.77, 57.4% female, 73.6% black, M body mass index = 25.5) and their primary caregivers who were randomized to the treatment group. Three groups of participants were created based on their patterns of attendance during the program: (1) noncompleters, (2) partial completers, and (3) completers. RESULTS: Results indicated no differences among the attendance groups in child gender, child body mass index, or child psychological functioning. Significant group differences were found with respect to race/ethnicity, parent marital status, and family income, such that noncompleters were more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities, to living in single parent households, and to have lower incomes than partial completers and completers. After controlling for the effects of these sociodemographic risk factors, noncompleters, and partial completers reported more family dysfunction characterized by high levels of disengagement than completers. CONCLUSION: Adapting existing weight management programs to include a focus on family engagement in the early stages of treatment may help to improve participation in family-based obesity interventions targeting high risk, socioeconomically disadvantaged youth.

Abstract:This article addresses the issue of clinically significant (or meaningful) change resulting from treatment for stuttering. Research in both medical and behavioral fields indicates that clients often have their own unique perspective of meaningful clinical change and that this perspective is often different from that of the professional administering the treatment. Among the variables that the client brings to the treatment session are their progression through stages of therapeutic change and the ways in which they believe they are capable of coping with their problem. Research has shown that how an individual interprets the meaning his or her therapeutic experience is central to clinically significant change. Procedures for obtaining feedback from clients concerning clinically significant change and the quality of the therapeutic alliance are described.

Title:The impact of religious fasting on human health.
Authors:['Trepanowski JF', 'Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The past two decades have seen a rise in the number of investigations examining the health-related effects of religiously motivated fasts. Islamic Ramadan is a 28 - 30 day fast in which food and drink are prohibited during the daylight hours. The majority of health-specific findings related to Ramadan fasting are mixed. The likely causes for these heterogeneous findings are the differences between studies in the following: 1) the amount of daily fasting time; 2) the percentage of subjects who smoke, take oral medications, and/or receive intravenous fluids; and 3) the subjects' typical food choices and eating habits. Greek Orthodox Christians fast for a total of 180 - 200 days each year, and their main fasting periods are the Nativity Fast (40 days prior to Christmas), Lent (48 days prior to Easter), and the Assumption (15 days in August). The fasting periods are more similar than dissimilar, and they can each be described as a variant of vegetarianism. Some of the more favorable effects of these fasts include the lowering of body mass, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. The Biblical-based Daniel Fast prohibits the consumption of animal products, refined carbohydrates, food additives, preservatives, sweeteners, flavorings, caffeine, and alcohol. It is most commonly partaken for 21 days, although fasts of 10 and 40 days have been observed. Our initial investigation of the Daniel Fast noted favorable effects on several health-related outcomes, including: blood pressure, blood lipids, insulin sensitivity, and biomarkers of oxidative stress. This review summarizes the health-specific effects of these fasts and provides suggestions for future research.

Abstract:The 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is characterized by cognitive decline and increased risk of psychiatric disorders, mainly schizophrenia. The molecular mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction in cognitive symptoms of 22q11DS are poorly understood. Here, we report that a mouse model of 22q11DS, the Df(16)1/+ mouse, exhibits substantially enhanced short- and long-term synaptic plasticity at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses, which coincides with deficits in hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. These changes are evident in mature but not young animals. Electrophysiological, two-photon imaging and glutamate uncaging, and electron microscopic assays in acute brain slices showed that enhanced neurotransmitter release but not altered postsynaptic function or structure caused these changes. Enhanced neurotransmitter release in Df(16)1/+ mice coincided with altered calcium kinetics in CA3 presynaptic terminals and upregulated sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase type 2 (SERCA2). SERCA inhibitors rescued synaptic phenotypes of Df(16)1/+ mice. Thus, presynaptic SERCA2 upregulation may be a pathogenic event contributing to the cognitive symptoms of 22q11DS.

Title:Use of flatbed transparency scanners in zebrafish research: versatile and economical adjuncts to traditional imaging tools for the Danio rerio laboratory.
Authors:['Lessman CA', 'Taylor MR', 'Orisme W', 'Carver EA']
Affiliation:Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:Flatbed transparency scanners are typically relegated to routine office tasks, yet they do offer a variety of potentially useful imaging tools for the zebrafish laboratory. These include motility screens, oocyte maturation and egg activation assays as well as counting and measuring tasks. When coupled with Macroscheduler (http://www.mjtnet.com) and ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij), the scanner becomes a stable platform for imaging large arrays of zebrafish oocytes, embryos, larvae, and adults. Such large arrays are a prerequisite to the development of high-throughput screens for small molecules as potential therapeutic drugs in the treatment of many diseases including cancer and epilepsy. Thus the scanner may have a role in adapting zebrafish to future drug and mutagenesis screening. In this chapter, some of the uses of scanners are outlined to bring attention to the potentials of this simple-to-use, flexible, inexpensive device for the zebrafish research community.

Abstract:Alloyed spherical FeNi-polymer nanocomposites were prepared via wet chemical method using hydrazine as a reducing agent and polymers (PVP and PEG) as reducing and stabilizing agent. Structural studies performed using XRD and TEM shows uniform dispersion of fine FeNi nanocrystallites in nanocomposite particles. The size and thermal stability of FeNi-polymer nanocomposite particles prepared under same reaction condition was found to be dependent on the type and the molecular weight of the polymer used. However, the magnetic properties of nanocomposite particles were not influenced by the polymers. The study highlights subtle differences in using polymers during the synthesis of alloyed nanocomposite particles.

Title:Tick saliva regulates migration, phagocytosis, and gene expression in the macrophage-like cell line, IC-21.

Abstract:We studied the effects of tick saliva on cell migration, cell signaling, phagocytosis, and gene expression in the murine macrophage cell line, IC-21. Saliva increased both basal- and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated migration in IC-21 cells. However, saliva did not affect PDGF-stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. Zymosan-mediated interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK) activity increased when cells were pretreated with saliva. Saliva suppressed phagocytosis of zymosan particles by IC-21 cells. An RT(2) Profiler PCR Array revealed that saliva regulates gene expression in a manner consistent with an immune response skewed toward a Th2 reaction, which is characterized by production of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. Our results using IC-21 cells suggest that Dermacentor variabilis has evolved a mechanism for regulating macrophage function, which may contribute to the tick's ability to modulate immune function.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To document primary health care (PHC) providers' tobacco use, and how this influences their smoking cessation practices and attitudes towards tobacco-control policies. METHODS: Anonymous questionnaires were distributed to PHC providers in 7 randomly selected PHC centers in Aleppo, Syria. RESULTS: All PHC providers completed the questionnaires (100% response rate). A quarter of these providers smoke cigarettes and more than 10% smoke waterpipes. Physicians who smoke were less likely to advise patients to quit (OR=0.29; 95% CI, 0.09-0.95), assess their motivation to quit (OR=0.13, 95% CI=0.02-0.72), or assist them in quitting (OR=0.24, 95% CI=0.06-0.99). PHC providers who smoke were less likely to support a ban on smoking in PHC settings (68.2% vs. 89.1%) and in enclosed public places (68.2% vs. 86.1%) or increases in the price of tobacco products (43.2% vs. 77.4%) (P<0.01 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Smoking, including waterpipe, continues to be widespread among PHC providers in Syria and will negatively influence implementation of anti-smoking program in PHC settings. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Smoking awareness and cessation interventions targeted to PHC providers, and training programs to build providers' competency in addressing their patients' smoking is crucial in Syria.

Abstract:Waterpipe tobacco smoking is increasing in popularity worldwide and available evidence point to its addictive and harmful potential. This study is conducted to assess nicotine exposure in daily waterpipe smokers, and its correlation with puff topography parameters. Sixty-one waterpipe tobacco smokers (56 males; mean age+/-SD, 30.9+/-9.5years; mean number of weekly waterpipe smoking episodes 7.8+/-5.7) abstained from smoking for at least 24h, and then smoked tobacco from a waterpipe ad libitum in a laboratory setting. During the session puff topography parameters were monitored continuously, and pre- and post-smoking expired-air CO was measured. Before and after smoking, venous blood was sampled for the assessment of plasma nicotine using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The average pre- and post-smoking expired-air CO was 4+/-1.7 and 35.5+/-32.7ppm, respectively (i.e., a CO boost of 31.5ppm, p<.001). Mean plasma nicotine concentration increased from 3.07+/-3.05ng/ml pre-smoking to 15.7+/-8.7ng/ml post-smoking (p<.001). Plasma nicotine boost was correlated with total session time (Pearson correlation coefficient r=.31, p=.04), cumulative puff duration (r=.37, p=.01), mean puff duration (r=.34, p=.02), and total smoke inhaled in the session (r=.34, p=.02. These data show considerable nicotine exposure in daily waterpipe smokers, and that nicotine exposure is a function of waterpipe smoking patterns.

Abstract:The ABC transporters Candida glabrata Cdr1 (CgCdr1), CgPdh1, and CgSnq2 are known to mediate azole resistance in the pathogenic fungus C. glabrata. Activating mutations in CgPDR1, a zinc cluster transcription factor, result in constitutive upregulation of these ABC transporter genes but to various degrees. We examined the genomewide gene expression profiles of two matched azole-susceptible and -resistant C. glabrata clinical isolate pairs. Of the differentially expressed genes identified in the gene expression profiles for these two matched pairs, there were 28 genes commonly upregulated with CgCDR1 in both isolate sets including YOR1, LCB5, RTA1, POG1, HFD1, and several members of the FLO gene family of flocculation genes. We then sequenced CgPDR1 from each susceptible and resistant isolate and found two novel activating mutations that conferred increased resistance when they were expressed in a common background strain in which CgPDR1 had been disrupted. Microarray analysis comparing these reengineered strains to their respective parent strains identified a set of commonly differentially expressed genes, including CgCDR1, YOR1, and YIM1, as well as genes uniquely regulated by specific mutations. Our results demonstrate that while CgPdr1 activates a broad repertoire of genes, specific activating mutations result in the activation of discrete subsets of this repertoire.

Abstract:Despite the development of a variety of efficacious alcohol intervention approaches for college students, few student drinkers seek help. The present study assessed students' history of help-seeking for alcohol problems, as well as their estimates of how likely they would be to use various help-seeking resources, should they wish to change their drinking. Participants were 197 college students who reported recent heavy drinking (46% male, 68.5% White, 27.4% African-American). Participants completed measures related to their drinking and their use (both past use and likelihood of future use) of 14 different alcohol help-seeking options. Repeated-measures analyses of variance revealed that students preferred informal help-seeking (e.g., talking to friends and family) over formal (e.g., talking with a counselor or medical provider) and anonymous resources (e.g., internet- or computer-based programs). Higher self-ideal discrepancy, greater depressive symptoms, and more alcohol-related consequences were positively associated with actual past help-seeking. Alcohol-related problems and normative discrepancy were negatively associated with hypothetical likelihood of utilizing all three help-seeking resources. These results suggest that heavy drinking college students prefer low-threshold intervention options including peer, family, computerized, and brief motivational interventions. Only 36 participants (18.3% of the sample) reported that they had utilized any of the help-seeking options queried, suggesting that campus prevention efforts should include both promoting low-threshold interventions and attempting to increase the salience of alcohol-related risk and the potential utility of changing drinking patterns.

Abstract:The authors conducted two randomized clinical trials with ethnically diverse samples of college student drinkers in order to determine (a) the relative efficacy of two popular computerized interventions versus a more comprehensive motivational interview approach (BASICS) and (b) the mechanisms of change associated with these interventions. In Study 1, heavy drinking participants recruited from a student health center (N = 74, 59% women, 23% African American) were randomly assigned to receive BASICS or the Alcohol 101 CD-ROM program. BASICS was associated with greater post-session motivation to change and self-ideal and normative discrepancy relative to Alcohol 101, but there were no group differences in the primary drinking outcomes at 1-month follow-up. Pre to post session increases in motivation predicted lower follow-up drinking across both conditions. In Study 2, heavy drinking freshman recruited from a core university course (N = 133, 50% women, 30% African American) were randomly assigned to BASICS, a web-based feedback program (e-CHUG), or assessment-only. BASICS was associated with greater post-session self-ideal discrepancy than e-CHUG, but there were no differences in motivation or normative discrepancy. There was a significant treatment effect on typical weekly and heavy drinking, with participants in BASICS reporting significantly lower follow-up drinking relative to assessment only participants. In Study 2, change in the motivation or discrepancy did not predict drinking outcomes. Across both studies, African American students assigned to BASICS reported medium effect size reductions in drinking whereas African American students assigned to Alcohol 101, e-CHUG, or assessment did not reduce their drinking.

Abstract:The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB6 is a mitochondrial porphyrin transporter that activates porphyrin biosynthesis. ABCB6 lacks a canonical mitochondrial targeting sequence but reportedly traffics to other cellular compartments such as the plasma membrane. How ABCB6 reaches these destinations is unknown. In this study, we show that endogenous ABCB6 is glycosylated in multiple cell types, indicating trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and has only one atypical site for glycosylation (NXC) in its amino terminus. ABCB6 remained glycosylated when the highly conserved cysteine (Cys-8) was substituted with serine to make a consensus site, NXS. However, this substitution blocked ER exit and produced ABCB6 degradation, which was mostly reversed by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. The amino terminus of ABCB6 has an additional highly conserved ER luminal cysteine (Cys-26). When Cys-26 was mutated alone or in combination with Cys-8, it also resulted in instability and ER retention. Further analysis revealed that these two cysteines form a disulfide bond. We discovered that other ABC transporters with an amino terminus in the ER had similarly configured conserved cysteines. This analysis led to the discovery of a disease-causing mutation in the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1)/ABCC8 from a patient with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. The mutant allele only contains a mutation in a conserved amino-terminal cysteine, producing SUR1 that fails to reach the cell surface. These results suggest that for ABC transporters the propensity to form a disulfide bond in the ER defines a unique checkpoint that determines whether a protein is ER-retained.

Title:Crystal structure of UBA2(ufd)-Ubc9: insights into E1-E2 interactions in Sumo pathways.

Abstract:Canonical ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) such as ubiquitin, Sumo, NEDD8, and ISG15 are ligated to targets by E1-E2-E3 multienzyme cascades. The Sumo cascade, conserved among all eukaryotes, regulates numerous biological processes including protein localization, transcription, DNA replication, and mitosis. Sumo conjugation is initiated by the heterodimeric Aos1-Uba2 E1 enzyme (in humans called Sae1-Uba2), which activates Sumo's C-terminus, binds the dedicated E2 enzyme Ubc9, and promotes Sumo C-terminal transfer between the Uba2 and Ubc9 catalytic cysteines. To gain insights into details of E1-E2 interactions in the Sumo pathway, we determined crystal structures of the C-terminal ubiquitin fold domain (ufd) from yeast Uba2 (Uba2(ufd)), alone and in complex with Ubc9. The overall structures of both yeast Uba2(ufd) and Ubc9 superimpose well on their individual human counterparts, suggesting conservation of fundamental features of Sumo conjugation. Docking the Uba2(ufd)-Ubc9 and prior full-length human Uba2 structures allows generation of models for steps in Sumo transfer from Uba2 to Ubc9, and supports the notion that Uba2 undergoes remarkable conformational changes during the reaction. Comparisons to previous structures from the NEDD8 cascade demonstrate that UBL cascades generally utilize some parallel E1-E2 interaction surfaces. In addition, the structure of the Uba2(ufd)-Ubc9 complex reveals interactions unique to Sumo E1 and E2. Comparison with a previous Ubc9-E3 complex structure demonstrates overlap between Uba2 and E3 binding sites on Ubc9, indicating that loading with Sumo and E3-catalyzed transfer to substrates are strictly separate steps. The results suggest mechanisms establishing specificity and order in Sumo conjugation cascades.

Abstract:RATIONALE: The tendency to use cocaine is determined by genetic and environmental effects across the lifespan. One critical environmental effect is early drug exposure, which is both driven by and interacts with genetic background. The mesoaccumbens dopamine system, which is critically involved in the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse, undergoes significant development during adolescence, and thus may be at particular risk to repeated nicotine exposure during this period, thereby establishing vulnerability for subsequent adult psychostimulant use. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypotheses that adolescent nicotine exposure results in attenuation of the enhancing effects of cocaine on medial forebrain bundle (MFB) electrical stimulation-evoked dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) in adulthood and that this effect is significantly influenced by genotype. METHODS: Mice from the progenitor strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J and those from the BXD20/TyJ and BXD86/RwwJ recombinant inbred lines were exposed to nicotine via osmotic minipumps from postnatal day (P) 28 to P56. When mice reached P70, dopamine functional dynamics in AcbSh was evaluated by means of in vivo fixed potential amperometry in combination with electrical stimulation of mesoaccumbens dopaminergic axons in the MFB. RESULTS: Adolescent exposure to nicotine in all strains dose-dependently reduced the ability of a fixed-dose challenge injection of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) to enhance MFB electrical stimulation-evoked dopamine release in AcbSh in adults. The magnitude of this effect was genotype-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a genotype-dependent mechanism by which nicotine exposure during adolescence causes persistent changes in the sensitivity to "hard" stimulants such as cocaine.

Abstract:Our previous works suggest that fractal texture feature is useful to detect pediatric brain tumor in multimodal MRI. In this study, we systematically investigate efficacy of using several different image features such as intensity, fractal texture, and level-set shape in segmentation of posterior-fossa (PF) tumor for pediatric patients. We explore effectiveness of using four different feature selection and three different segmentation techniques, respectively, to discriminate tumor regions from normal tissue in multimodal brain MRI. We further study the selective fusion of these features for improved PF tumor segmentation. Our result suggests that Kullback-Leibler divergence measure for feature ranking and selection and the expectation maximization algorithm for feature fusion and tumor segmentation offer the best results for the patient data in this study. We show that for T1 and fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI modalities, the best PF tumor segmentation is obtained using the texture feature such as multifractional Brownian motion (mBm) while that for T2 MRI is obtained by fusing level-set shape with intensity features. In multimodality fused MRI (T1, T2, and FLAIR), mBm feature offers the best PF tumor segmentation performance. We use different similarity metrics to evaluate quality and robustness of these selected features for PF tumor segmentation in MRI for ten pediatric patients.

Abstract:A dual-ligand gold nanoparticle (DLGNP) was designed and synthesized to explore the therapeutic benefits of multivalent interactions between gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and cancer cells. DLGNP was tested on human epidermal cancer cells (KB), which had high expression of folate receptor. The cellular uptake of DLGNP was increased by 3.9 and 12.7 folds compared with GNP-folate or GNP-glucose. The enhanced cell recognition was due to multivalent interactions between both ligands on GNPs and cancer cells as shown by the ligand competition experiments. Furthermore, the multivalent interactions increased contrast between cells with high and low expression of folate receptors. The enhanced cell recognition enabled DLGNP to kill KB cells under X-ray irradiation at a dose that was safe to folate receptor low-expression (such as normal) cells. Thus DLGNP has the potential to be a cancer-specific nano-theranostic agent.

Title:Companion animals symposium: development of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, the resident microbiota, and the role of diet in early life.
Authors:['Buddington RK', 'Sangild PT']

Abstract:Mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) development is guided by genetic determinants established during the evolution of mammals and matched to the natural diet and environment. Coevolution of the host GI tract (GIT) and the resident bacteria has resulted in commensal relationships that are species and even individual specific. The interactions between the host and the GI bacteria are 2-way and of particular importance during the neonatal period, when the GIT needs to adapt rapidly to the external environment, begin processing of oral foods, and acquire the ability to differentiate between and react appropriately to colonizing commensal and potentially pathogenic bacteria. During this crucial period of life, the patterns of gene expression that determine GI structural and functional development are modulated by the bacteria colonizing the previously sterile GIT of fetuses. The types and amounts of dietary inputs after birth influence GI development, species composition, and metabolic characteristics of the resident bacteria, and the interactions that occur between the bacteria and the host. This review provides overviews of the age-related changes in GIT functions, the resident bacteria, and diet, and describes how interactions among these 3 factors influence the health and nutrition of neonates and can have lifelong consequences. Necrotizing enterocolitis is a common GI inflammatory disorder in preterm infants and is provided as an example of interactions that go awry. Other enteric diseases are common in all newborn mammals, and an understanding of the above interactions will enhance efforts to support neonatal health for infants and for farm and companion animals.

Title:Promotion of phagocytosis of Streptococcus pyogenes in human blood by a fibrinogen-binding peptide.
Authors:['Li Y', 'Courtney HS']
Affiliation:Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis, TN 38104, United States.
Abstract:The binding of fibrinogen to M-related protein (Mrp) is known to contribute to the ability of Streptococcus pyogenes to evade phagocytosis by preventing the deposition of complement on the streptococcal surface. The objectives of this investigation were to map the common fibrinogen-binding domain of Mrp and to determine if this domain has a therapeutic potential to enhance phagocytosis of S. pyogenes in human blood. Using a series of recombinant, truncated proteins of Mrp, two fibrinogen-binding domains (FBD) were mapped. FBD1 was contained within amino acid residues 1-55 of Mrp and FBD2 within residues 81-138. FBD2 is found in all Mrp sequenced to date whereas FBD1 is not. Both FBD1 and FBD2 peptides but not a control peptide blocked the binding of fibrinogen to S. pyogenes and promoted phagocytosis of the streptococci in human blood. The data support the hypothesis that the binding of fibrinogen by S. pyogenes is centrally involved in their resistance to phagocytosis in human blood and suggest that treatments that interfere with the binding of fibrinogen to S. pyogenes may help in fighting infections by these organisms.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate visual system development in children being treated for retinoblastoma. METHODS: Informed consent was obtained for all participants (N = 42) in this institutional review board-approved study. Participants were imaged with a 1.5-T scanner while under propofol sedation. Diagnostic brain and orbital imaging was followed by investigational functional neuroimaging, which included fMRI during photic stimulation through closed eyelids, to measure functional activation in the visual cortex, and DTI, to evaluate diffusion parameters of white matter tracts in the corpus callosum and the periventricular optic radiations. Analysis included 115 examinations of 39 patients with a median age of 16.4 months and age range from 1.5 to 101.5 months at first evaluation. RESULTS: The blood oxygen level-dependent signal was predominantly negative and located in the anterior visual cortex. Activation was affected by tumor lateralization (unilateral or bilateral), macular involvement, and retinal detachment. Patients who had undergone unilateral enucleation showed cortical dominance corresponding to the projection from the nasal hemiretina in the unaffected eye. Diffusion parameters followed a normal developmental trajectory in the optic radiations and corpus callosum, but variability was greater in the splenium than in the genu of the corpus callosum. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal functional neuroimaging demonstrated important effects of disease and treatment. Therefore, fMRI and DTI may be useful for characterizing the impact of retinoblastoma on the developing visual system and improving the prediction of visual outcome in survivors.

Title:Influence of loading cycle profile and frequency on a biomechanical parameter of a model of a balloon kyphoplasty-augmented lumbar spine segment: a finite element analysis study.
Authors:['Li Y', 'Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152-3180, USA.
Abstract:For patients who are suffering debilitating and persistent pain due to vertebral compression fracture(s) and for whom conservative therapies have not provided relief, balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) is used as a surgical option. There are only a very few literature reports on the use of the finite element analysis (FEA) method to obtain biomechanical parameters of models of spine segments that include BKP augmentation at a given level. In each of these studies, the applied loading used was quasi-static. During normal activities of daily living, the patient's spine would be subject to dynamically-applied loading. Thus, the question of the influence of the characteristics of a dynamically-applied loading cycle on biomechanical parameters of a spine that includes BKP-augmented segment(s) is germane; however, a study of this issue is lacking. We investigated this issue in the present FEA work, with the spine segment model being the L1-L3 motion segment units (MSUs) (a segment that is commonly augmented using BKP) and prophylactic BKP simulated at L2. The dynamic load was the compressive load-versus-time cycle to which the L3-L4 MSU is subjected during gait. Four cases of the cycle were considered, corresponding to slow-, normal-, fast- and very fast-paced gait. The loading cycle was applied to the superior surface of L1 while the inferior surface of L3 was fully constrained. It was found that (1) the global mean von Mises stress during the loading cycle (sigmaVMG), in each tissue in the model increased in going from a slow-paced gait cycle to a very fast-paced gait cycle; and (2) for the slow-paced gait cycle, with increase in frequency of the cycle, f (1 </= f </= 3 Hz), sigmaVMG in each of these tissues increased. Potential uses of the present findings are identified.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 requires prescription drug plans to provide medication therapy management (MTM) services to Medicare beneficiaries who are at high risk for inappropriate use of medications. However, inadequate compensation has been a barrier for MTM expansion among pharmacists. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine pharmacists' acceptable levels of compensation for MTM services. METHODS: A preference-based fractional factorial design of conjoint analysis was used by surveying 1524 active pharmacists in Tennessee. Pharmacists were asked to select between packages (scenarios) of MTM services that represented combinations of MTM attributes (characteristics). The MTM attributes included type of patient (new or returning), patient's number of chronic conditions (1, 3, or 6), patient's number of medications (4, 8, or 16), patient's annual drug costs ($2000, $3000, or $4000), service duration (15 minutes, 30 minutes, or 45 minutes), and price of MTM services ($30, $60, or $120). A survival analysis model was used to predict pharmacists' willingness to select 1 versus another MTM service package. Pharmacists' acceptable level of compensation was estimated as the marginal rate of substitution between the parameter estimates of an attribute and the price attribute of MTM. RESULTS: The parameter estimates were -0.0303 (P<.0001) for service duration and 0.0210 (P<.0001) for price of MTM services, respectively, so pharmacists were willing to accept $1.44/min (0.0303/0.0210), or $86.4/h, for MTM services. Pharmacists' characteristics were associated significantly with their acceptable levels of compensation: years of practice was associated with a higher need for compensation, pharmacy ownership (vs nonowner) associated with a lower need, and having provided MTM previously (vs having not provided MTM) was associated with a higher need. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists' acceptable level of compensation is in the higher part of current ranges from $30 to $100/h. To increase participation in MTM services, pharmacist compensation needs to be increased. Future studies might continue to corroborate the generalizability of findings from this study.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Chitosan was investigated as a coating for local delivery of antimicrobials for prevention of acute implant infection. The objectives of this study were to (1) measure the release of 2 antimicrobials from chitosan coatings, (2) determine efficacy of eluted antimicrobials against bacteria, in vitro, and (3) evaluate toxicity of eluted drugs to host cells/tissues. METHODS: Chitosan coatings (80.7% deacetylated, 108 kDa) containing 20% tetracycline or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate were bonded to titanium via silane reactions. After elution in culture medium for 7 days, eluates were tested against model pathogens Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Staphylococcus epidermidis in turbidity tests and in 24-hour cytotoxicity tests using human osteoblasts and fibroblasts. Finally, antibiotic-loaded chitosan-coated titanium pins were implanted for 7 days in muscle of Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the initial tissue response. RESULTS: Coatings released 89% of tetracycline in 7 days and 100% chlorhexidine in 2 days. Released tetracycline inhibited growth (95%-99.9%) of pathogens for up to 7 days with no cytotoxicity to human cells. Released chlorhexidine was active against pathogens for 1 to 2 days (56%-99.5% inhibition) but was toxic to cells on the first day of elution. Typical acute inflammatory response was observed to antimicrobial-loaded chitosan coatings similar to unloaded coatings. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data support the hypothesis that chitosan coatings have the potential to locally deliver antimicrobials to inhibit bacteria without being toxic to host cells/tissues and warrant additional studies to evaluate the ability of the coatings to prevent/resist infection and promote osseointegration.

Abstract:Polyethylene wear after a total knee arthroplasty is inevitable. The effects of the wear particles on the surrounding soft tissue causing inflammatory responses and eventual aseptic loosening are well documented, but the biomechanical changes from polyethylene wear have been less understood. This study investigated how wear from a retrieved polyethylene insert from a total knee arthroplasty changed the kinematics and contact stresses. A cruciate-retaining total knee implant (Natural-Knee, Intermedics Orthopedics, Inc., Austin, Texas) was retrieved from a donor program. The polyethylene insert was then scanned and modeled. KneeSIM (LifeMOD/KneeSIM, San Clemente, California) was used to simulate one cycle of gait of three second duration (100% of cycle). A threefold increase in contact stress as well as resulting kinematic changes were seen when the model was used to compare the retrieved versus a modeled off-the-shelf new polyethylene insert. Total knee designs should take into account the wear patterns that result from years of use and how they may affect the biomechanics of the knee long term.

Abstract:One of the common reasons for early revision or poor outcome in total knee arthroplasty is due to patellar maltracking, loosening, or pain. The analysis of how the patellofemoral mechanism operates and wears in vivo has not been a focus of many retrieval studies. This paper describes the wear pattern observed on patellar buttons from well-functioning TKA specimens that were harvested as part of a donor program. The attempt was to describe the variations in wear patterns to see if any commonalities existed that may predict a well-functioning patellofemoral mechanism after TKA.

Title:The bit in the middle and why it's important: a computational analysis of the linguistic features of body paragraphs.

Abstract:This study examines the relationship between the linguistic characteristics of body paragraphs of student essays and the total number of paragraphs in the essays. Results indicate a significant relationship between the total number of paragraphs and a variety of linguistic characteristics known to affect student essay scores. These linguistic characteristics (e.g., semantic overlap, syntactic complexity) contribute to two underlying factors (i.e., textual cohesion and difficulty) that are used as dependent variables in mixed-effect models. Results suggest that student essays with 5-8 paragraphs tend to be more linguistically consistent than student essays with 3, 4, and 9 paragraphs. Essays with totals of 5-8 paragraphs, considered by many educators to contain an optimal number of paragraphs, may include functionally and structurally similar paragraphs. These findings could aid writing researchers and educators in obtaining a clearer view of the relationship between the total number of paragraphs comprising an essay and the linguistic characteristics that affect essay evaluation. Consequently, writing interventions may become better equipped to pinpoint student difficulties and facilitate student writing skills by providing more detailed and informed feedback.

Title:TRIM56 is a virus- and interferon-inducible E3 ubiquitin ligase that restricts pestivirus infection.

Abstract:The tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family comprises more than 60 members that have diverse functions in various biological processes. Although a small number of TRIM proteins have been shown to regulate innate immunity, much remains to be learned about the functions of the majority of the TRIM proteins. Here we identify TRIM56 as a cellular protein associated with the N-terminal protease (N(pro)) of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a pestiviral interferon antagonist which degrades interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) through the proteasome. We found that TRIM56 was constitutively expressed in most tissues, and its abundance was further upregulated moderately by interferon or virus. The manipulation of TRIM56 abundance did not affect the protein turnover of N(pro) and IRF3. Rather, ectopic expression of TRIM56 substantially impaired, while knockdown of TRIM56 expression greatly enhanced, BVDV replication in cell culture. The antiviral activity of TRIM56 depended on its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity as well as the integrity of its C-terminal region but was not attributed to a general augmentation of the interferon antiviral response. Overexpression of TRIM56 did not inhibit the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus or hepatitis C virus, a virus closely related to BVDV. Together, our data demonstrate that TRIM56 is a novel antiviral host factor that restricts pestivirus infection.

Title:Corticosterone, brood size, and hatch order in free-living Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) nestlings.
Authors:['Rensel MA', 'Wilcoxen TE', 'Schoech SJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. mrensel@ucla.edu
Abstract:It is well known that variation in developmental conditions can have profound effects upon lifetime fitness. In altricial avian species, nestlings undergo a substantial portion of development in the nest after hatching, often in the presence of nest-mates. This can result in the formation of brood hierarchies based on age, size, and competitive ability. Measurement of baseline corticosterone (CORT) levels in developing birds may provide a means to assess whether individuals within a brood experience stress due to sibling competition or nutritional state. However, few studies have attempted to correlate corticosterone concentrations with brood hierarchies in free-living, developing birds. We investigated the degree to which corticosterone levels in nestling Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) were predicted by brood size, hatching order, and body mass. Nestling corticosterone levels were inversely correlated with body mass but did not differ among brood sizes. Within broods of two, second-hatched nestlings had lower CORT than first-hatched nestlings, although there was no effect of hatch order in broods of three or four nestlings. The results of this study suggest that conditions within the nest, particularly those associated with within-brood hierarchies, are manifested through differential body condition and nestling corticosterone secretion. The consequences of this variation in nestling corticosterone are unknown, but development of the adult phenotype, as well as life-long survival, may be impacted.

Title:Repeatability of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels across early life stages in the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens).
Authors:['Rensel MA', 'Schoech SJ']

Abstract:Recent studies have posited that the pattern of glucocorticoid secretion within an individual represents a stable, fixed physiological trait. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the repeatability of baseline and stress-induced corticosterone (CORT) secretion across developmental stages and years in Florida scrub-jays. We sampled individuals from multiple cohorts repeatedly from the age of 11 days post-hatch up to 4 years of age. We found a significant degree of repeatability within individuals in stress-induced corticosterone levels, i.e., the amount of hormone secreted during a standardized stress protocol (corrected integrated corticosterone). However, baseline corticosterone levels were not statistically repeatable, although there was some indication that nestling levels predicted levels at 1 year of age. The results of this study indicate that stress-induced CORT levels are consistent within individual scrub-jays, and the degree to which a young jay mounts an acute stress response appears to be somewhat "set" by the age of nutritional independence. Thus stress-induced corticosterone secretion appears to be a stable, repeatable trait within individuals and as such may be subject to natural selection.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate a 12-week weight management intervention involving computerized self-monitoring and technology-assisted feedback with and without an enhanced behavioral component. METHODS: 120 overweight (30.5+/-2.6kg/m(2)) adults (45.0+/-10.3 years) were randomized to one of three groups: computerized self-monitoring with Basic feedback (n=45), Enhanced behavioral feedback (n=45), or wait-list control (n=30). Intervention participants used a computer software program to record dietary and physical activity information. Weekly e-mail feedback was based on computer-generated reports, and participants attended monthly measurement visits. RESULTS: The Basic and Enhanced groups experienced significant weight reduction (-2.7+/-3.3kg and -2.5+/-3.1kg) in comparison to the Control group (0.3+/-2.2; p<0.05). Waist circumference and systolic blood pressure also decreased in intervention groups compared to Control (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A program using computerized self-monitoring, technology-assisted feedback, and monthly measurement visits produced significant weight loss after 12 weeks. However, the addition of an enhanced behavioral component did not improve the effectiveness of the program. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests that healthcare professionals can effectively deliver a weight management intervention using technology-assisted strategies in a format that may complement and reduce face-to-face sessions.

Abstract:Repressive adaptation has been conceptualized as one pathway to psychological resilience in children with cancer, but the physiological costs of maintaining a repressive adaptive style are currently unknown. The goal of this study was to examine physiological functioning as a function of adaptive style in children with cancer (N = 120) and healthy controls (N = 120). Children completed self-report measures of state anxiety and defensiveness prior to participating in three verbal stress tasks while monitoring blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and electrodermal response, and rated their anxiety following each task. Findings indicated no consistent differences in baseline indices and physiological reactivity as a function of adaptive style or health status (cancer vs. control). In addition, children identified as having a repressive adaptive style did not exhibit greater verbal-autonomic discrepancy than low-anxious children. In contrast to findings with adults, children with a repressive adaptive style do not appear to experience adverse effects of this coping style in terms of physiological reactivity.

Abstract:We examined caregiver awareness of the American Academy of Pediatrics' prone play recommendation, determined the primary sources of the recommendation, and examined why some infants are not provided "tummy time." Of caregivers, 25% were not aware of prone play recommendations, and one-fourth of that group was not aware of potential complications from limited tummy time. The primary sources of prone play information and potential complications were printed materials, then pediatricians. Of infants, 53% received < or = 30 min; 35% were intolerant of the prone position. This study indicates that many caregivers are not aware of tummy time and complications that can occur if it is not provided. Health care professionals, including therapists, must educate parents on the importance of prone play and provide information on how to increase infant tolerance for prone play time.

Title:A dual investigation of the effect of dietary supplementation with licorice flavonoid oil on anthropometric and biochemical markers of health and adiposity.
Authors:['Bell ZW', 'Canale RE', 'Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Licorice flavonoid oil (LFO) has been reported to minimize visceral adipose tissue gain in obese mice and to result in a decrease in body weight and body fat in humans; the effects of which may be more pronounced when administered in an overfed state. METHODS: We investigated the effects of LFO in two separate studies. Study 1 included a sample of overweight or grade I-II obese men and women (N = 22) who followed their usual dietary and physical activity programs. Study 2 included a sample of athletic men who followed their usual dietary and physical activity programs but consumed a daily supplemental meal (25% above daily energy requirements) in an attempt to induce a state of overfeeding. In both studies, subjects were randomly assigned (double-blind) to either LFO or a placebo for eight weeks, and anthropometric and multiple biochemical outcomes (e.g., markers of oxidative stress, markers of insulin sensitivity, blood lipids, etc.) were obtained before and following the intervention. RESULTS: No differences of statistical significance were noted between LFO and placebo for any measured variable in Study 1 or Study 2. When investigating the percent change from baseline for data in Study 2, although not of statistical significance, subjects in the LFO condition experienced less overall fat gain, as well as attenuation in the elevation in selected blood lipids (e.g., cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides). CONCLUSION: These combined data indicate little effect of LFO supplementation within a sample of overweight/obese men and women or athletic men, with the possible exception of attenuation in body fat gain and selected components of the blood lipid panel in response to an overfeeding condition.

Abstract:Here we study the multivariate quantitative constructive approximation of real and complex valued continuous multivariate functions on a box or RN, NinN, by the multivariate quasi-interpolation sigmoidal neural network operators. The "right" operators for our goal are fully and precisely described. This approximation is derived by establishing multidimensional Jackson type inequalities involving the multivariate modulus of continuity of the engaged function or its high order partial derivatives. Our multivariate operators are defined by using a multidimensional density function induced by the logarithmic sigmoidal function. The approximations are pointwise and uniform. The related feed-forward neural network is with one hidden layer.

Abstract:STUDY DESIGN: Using a low cell density, hypoxic, alginate-bead culture system, the effects of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and synthetic peptide B2A on cell proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis were assessed at days 0, 3, 5, and 7, using nucleus pulposus (NP)-like differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). OBJECTIVE: This is a preliminary investigation into B2A's potential adjunctive role with MSCs and BMP-2, in NP regeneration. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: B2A analogs, alone and in combination with BMP-2, have been shown to promote proliferation and ECM production in chondrocytes and MSCs. Articular chondrocytes and NP cells often respond in a similar manner to growth factor treatments, thus suggesting a potential role for B2A in treating disc degeneration by NP regeneration. METHODS: Using the NP regeneration in vitro model (low cell density, hypoxic, alginate bead culture), B2A and BMP-2 were evaluated alone and in combination, to determine effects on proliferation and ECM synthesis in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta 3 on NP-like differentiated MSCs. RESULTS: B2A administration induced mild proliferation of NP-like differentiated MSCs and diminished an initial wave of low-dose BMP-2-prompted apoptosis. Individually and in combination, B2A and BMP-2 were found to inhibit transforming growth factor-beta 3-permitted collagen accumulation; levels remained similar in their presence. Both collagen I (Col I) and collagen II (Col II) were found in almost all specimens, but increased B2A levels favored Col II unlike BMP-2, which favored Col I. BMP-2 resulted in a minor reduction in aggrecan synthesis, which was unchanged by B2A. CONCLUSION: Using this in vitro model, B2A induced proliferation, continuous aggrecan synthesis, and stabilized collagen accumulation favoring Col II. These characteristics are consistent with cells of the young, healthy NP, indicating potential use of the peptide early in an MSC-based NP-regeneration therapy; whereas, BMP-2 induced apoptosis, Col I accumulation, and aggrecan production hindrance, and was found untherapeutic.

Abstract:Antioxidants play key roles in preventing free radical damage to various molecules, cells, and tissues, but it is not well understood how variation in antioxidant levels may relate to the reproductive success or health of wild animals. We explored the relationship between circulating antioxidant concentrations and both body condition and timing of reproduction in male and female Florida Scrub-Jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens), a cooperatively breeding passerine bird. We examined whether levels of uric acid, vitamin E, and carotenoids (all potentially important antioxidants) were linked to body condition and timing of reproduction, two measures that are directly related to reproductive success. Antioxidant concentrations were not correlated with body condition, but they were related to timing of first clutch initiation, though not always in the predicted direction. Elevated circulating levels of carotenoids were associated with delayed clutch initiation in female breeders. Relatively higher vitamin E levels in control birds were associated with earlier clutch initiation, whereas male breeders that received long-term food supplementation had elevated levels of vitamin E and delayed reproduction. Several potential explanations for the link between elevated levels of antioxidants and delayed clutch initiation are discussed. Separate explanations for each sex include, but are not limited to, oxidative stress as a result of territory defense efforts in males, different dietary regimes due to supplementation, and mobilized plasma antioxidants in females that were coping with a stressor.

Title:Association between extent of simulated degeneration of C5-C6 disc and biomechanical parameters of a model of the full cervical spine: a finite element analysis study.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To delineate the association between extent of degeneration of the disc at C5-C6, simulated in a model of the full cervical spine, and biomechanical responses of the model. METHODS: A validated three-dimensional model of an intact, healthy, adult full cervical spine (C1-C7) was constructed. This model was then modified to create three models simulating mild, moderate, and severe grades of degeneration of the disc at C5-C6. For each of these four models, we used the finite element analysis method to obtain three biomechanical parameters at various tissues in the model, under seven different physiologically relevant loadings. RESULTS: For each of the biomechanical parameters, the results were expressed as relative change in its value when a specified combination of simulated degeneration model and applied loading was used, with respect to the corresponding value in the intact model. We introduced a new measure, which we designate the composite biomechanical performance index (CBPI), whose value incorporates all of the aforementioned relative changes. CONCLUSIONS: We found that CBPI increased with increase in the severity of disc degeneration simulated. The clinical relevance of CBPI should be addressed in future work.

The model is then fitted to some retinoblastoma data from the SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology End Results) project of the National Cancer Institute for the years 1973-1982. In all the cases presented, the estimated incidence functions appear to fit the observed incidence curves quite well, suggesting the usefulness of the model.

Abstract:Preclinical and clinical evidence suggest an association between alcoholism and the primary regulator of extracellular dopamine concentrations, the dopamine transporter (DAT). However, the nature of this association is unclear. We determined if 10 days of voluntary alcohol self-administration followed by withdrawal could directly alter DAT function, or if genetically mediated changes in DAT function and/or availability could influence vulnerability to alcohol abuse. Heterozygous (DAT+/-) and homozygous mutant (DAT-/-) and wild-type (DAT+/+) mice were allowed to consume 5% alcohol in a schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) task. In vivo fixed potential amperometry in anesthetized mice was used to (1) identify functional characteristics of mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons related to genotype, including dopamine autoreceptor (DAR) sensitivity, DAT efficiency, and DAT capacity, (2) determine if any of these characteristics correlated with alcohol drinking observed in DAT+/+ and DAT+/- animals, and (3) determine if SIP-alcohol self-administration altered DAR sensitivity, DAT efficiency, and DAT capacity by comparing these characteristics in wild-type (DAT+/+) mice that were SIP-alcohol naive, with those that had undergone SIP-alcohol testing. DAT-/- mice consumed significantly less alcohol during testing and this behavioral difference was related to significant differences in DAR sensitivity, DAT efficiency, and DAT capacity. These functional characteristics were correlated to varying degrees with g/kg alcohol consumption in DAT+/+ and DAT+/- mice. DAR sensitivity was consistently reduced and DAT efficiency was enhanced in SIP-alcohol-experienced DAT+/+ mice when compared with naive animals. These results indicate that DAR sensitivity is reduced by SIP-alcohol consumption and that DAT efficiency is modified by genotype and SIP-alcohol exposure. DAT capacity appeared to be strictly associated with SIP-alcohol consumption.

Abstract:Traditionally, well-defined three-dimensional structure has been thought to be essential for protein function. However, myriad biological functions are performed by highly dynamic, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). IDPs often fold upon binding their biological targets and frequently show 'binding diversity' by targeting multiple ligands. We sought to understand the physical basis of IDP binding diversity and report here that the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p21(Cip1) adaptively binds to and inhibits the various Cdk-cyclin complexes that regulate eukaryotic cell division. Using results from NMR spectroscopy and biochemical and cellular assays, we show that structural adaptability of a helical subdomain within p21, termed LH, enables two other subdomains, D1 and D2, to specifically bind conserved surface features of the cyclin and Cdk subunits, respectively, within otherwise structurally distinct Cdk-cyclin complexes. Adaptive folding upon binding is likely to mediate the diverse biological functions of the thousands of IDPs present in eukaryotes.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: To facilitate prospective medical assessment of adults surviving pediatric malignancies and advance knowledge about long-term childhood cancer survivor health, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) is establishing a lifetime cohort of survivors. METHODS: Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) study include: (1) diagnosis of childhood malignancy treated at SJCRH; (2) survival >/= 10 years from diagnosis; and (3) current age >/= 18 years. Three levels of participation are offered: (1) comprehensive evaluation on SJCRH campus; (2) limited home evaluation; or (3) completion of health surveys only. A systematic recruitment structure based upon blocks of 50 patients initially focused on leukemia and lymphoma survivors and patients eligible for pilot studies. RESULTS: As of January 1, 2010, 1,625 (42%) of 3,900 eligible >/= 10-year survivors have been contacted. Among the first 1,000 potentially eligible survivors selected for recruitment, 971 were subsequently confirmed to fulfill eligibility criteria. To date, 898/971 (92.5%) have been successfully contacted of whom 825 (91.8%) have agreed to participate. Among participants, 88.6% agreed to comprehensive medical evaluation, 0.4% limited local evaluation, and 11.0% survey only. Anticipated minimum overall participation rate for medical evaluation is 75.3% (731/971). Comparison of those contacted who agreed versus declined to participate revealed a greater proportion of males who declined participation (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Early results of the SJLIFE study support its feasibility to recruit aging childhood cancer survivors to research investigations evaluating late health outcomes by medical assessments.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of hypothalamic/pituitary radiation (HPT RT) dose on the occurrence of first pregnancy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of childhood cancer 5-year survivors (CCS) diagnosed between 1970 and 1986 before 21 years of age at one of 26 North American pediatric cancer treatment centers. SETTING: Self-administered questionnaire. PATIENT(S): A total of 3,619 female CCS who participated in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and received no or scatter (</=0.1 Gy) radiation to the ovaries and 2,081 female siblings (Sibs) of the participants. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Self-reported pregnancy events. RESULT(S): As a group, CCS were as likely to report being pregnant as Sibs (hazard ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.97-1.19). Multivariable models showed a significant decrease in the risk of pregnancy with HPT RT doses>/=22 Gy compared with those CCS receiving no HPT RT. CONCLUSION(S): These results support the hypothesis that exposures of 22-27 Gy HPT RT may be a contributing factor to infertility among female CCS.

Abstract:Platelet activation initiates an upsurge in polyunsaturated (18:2 and 20:4) lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) production. The biochemical pathway(s) responsible for LPA production during blood clotting are not yet fully understood. Here we describe the purification of a phospholipase A(1) (PLA(1)) from thrombin-activated human platelets using sequential chromatographic steps followed by fluorophosphonate (FP)-biotin affinity labeling and proteomics characterization that identified acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1), also known as lysophospholipase A-I (LYPLA-I; accession code O75608) as a novel PLA(1). Addition of this recombinant PLA(1) significantly increased the production of sn-2-esterified polyunsaturated LPCs and the corresponding LPAs in plasma. We examined the regioisomeric preference of lysophospholipase D/autotaxin (ATX), which is the subsequent step in LPA production. To prevent acyl migration, ether-linked regioisomers of oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lyso-PAF) were synthesized. ATX preferred the sn-1 to the sn-2 regioisomer of lyso-PAF. We propose the following LPA production pathway in blood: 1) Activated platelets release PLA(1); 2) PLA(1) generates a pool of sn-2 lysophospholipids; 3) These newly generated sn-2 lysophospholipids undergo acyl migration to yield sn-1 lysophospholipids, which are the preferred substrates of ATX; and 4) ATX cleaves the sn-1 lysophospholipids to generate sn-1 LPA species containing predominantly 18:2 and 20:4 fatty acids.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Betaine, beetroot juice, and supplemental nitrate have recently been reported to improve certain aspects of exercise performance, which may be mechanistically linked to increased nitric oxide. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of betaine supplementation on plasma nitrate/nitrite, a surrogate marker or nitric oxide, in exercise-trained men. METHODS: We used three different study designs (acute intake of betaine at 1.25 and 5.00 grams, chronic intake of betaine at 2.5 grams per day for 14 days, and chronic [6 grams of betaine per day for 7 days] followed by acute intake [6 grams]), all involving exercise-trained men, to investigate the effects of orally ingested betaine on plasma nitrate/nitrite. Blood samples were collected before and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after ingestion of 1.25 and 5.00 grams of betaine (Study 1); before and after 14 days of betaine supplementation at a dosage of 2.5 grams (Study 2); and before and after 7 days of betaine supplementation at a dosage of 6 grams, followed by acute ingestion of 6 grams and blood measures at 30 and 60 min post ingestion (Study 3). RESULTS: In Study 1, nitrate/nitrite was relatively unaffected and no statistically significant interaction (p = 0.99), dosage (p = 0.69), or time (p = 0.91) effects were noted. Similar findings were noted in Study 2, with no statistically significant interaction (p = 0.57), condition (p = 0.98), or pre/post intervention (p = 0.17) effects noted for nitrate/nitrite. In Study 3, no statistically significant changes were noted in nitrate/nitrite between collection times (p = 0.97). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that acute or chronic ingestion of betaine by healthy, exercise-trained men does not impact plasma nitrate/nitrite. These findings suggest that other mechanisms aside from increasing circulating nitric oxide are likely responsible for any performance enhancing effect of betaine supplementation.

Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory The University of Memphis Memphis, TN 38152, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Dietary modification via both caloric and nutrient restriction is associated with multiple health benefits, some of which are related to an improvement in antioxidant status and a decrease in the production of reactive oxygen species. The Daniel Fast is based on the Biblical book of Daniel, is commonly partaken for 21 days, and involves food intake in accordance with a stringent vegan diet. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of a 21 day Daniel Fast on biomarkers of antioxidant status and oxidative stress. METHODS: 43 subjects (13 men; 30 women; 35 +/- 1 yrs; range: 20-62 yrs) completed a 21 day Daniel Fast following the guidelines provided by investigators. Subjects reported to the lab in a 12 hour post-absorptive state both pre fast (day 1) and post fast (day 22). At each visit, blood was collected for determination of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitrate/nitrite (NOx), Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC), and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Subjects recorded dietary intake during the 7 day period immediately prior to the fast and during the final 7 days of the fast. RESULTS: A decrease was noted in MDA (0.66 +/- 0.0.03 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.02 mumol L-1; p = 0.004), while H2O2 demonstrated a trend for lowering (4.42 +/- 0.32 vs. 3.78 +/- 0.21 mumol L-1; p = 0.074). Both NOx (18.79 +/- 1.92 vs. 26.97 +/- 2.40 mumol L-1; p = 0.003) and TEAC (0.47 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.51 +/- 0.01 mmol L-1; p = 0.001) increased from pre to post fast, while ORAC was unchanged (5243 +/- 103 vs. 5249 +/- 183 mumol L-1 TE; p = 0.974). As expected, multiple differences in dietary intake were noted (p < 0.05), including a reduction in total calorie intake (2185 +/- 94 vs. 1722 +/- 85). CONCLUSION: Modification of dietary intake in accordance with the Daniel Fast is associated with an improvement in selected biomarkers of antioxidant status and oxidative stress, including metabolites of nitric oxide (i.e., NOx).

Title:Success in nursing school: black nursing students' perception of peers, family, and faculty.
Authors:['Dapremont JA']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Loewenberg School of Nursing, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. jdaprmnt@memphis.edu
Abstract:Blacks comprise 12.3% of the U.S. population and only 4.6% of registered nurses nationally. Moreover, Blacks have the highest percentage of nongraduates among nursing students compared with other U.S. racial/ethnic groups. This descriptive qualitative study examined the perceptions and experiences that contributed to success for Black graduates, ages 18 to 50, who attended nursing degree programs with predominantly White students and identified the experiences students credited for their success. Data were collected using semi-structured in-depth interviews with 18 participants. Categories and patterns were established using content analysis. Findings suggest that the Black students valued peer support, interactions with White students' study groups, family support, and faculty encouragement and support as factors that enhanced success. This article focuses on those supports students identified as essential to graduation. The findings of this study demonstrate that it takes a community to create a nurse. Specific implications for student retention are discussed.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Limited treatment options exist for smokers who are not ready to make a quit attempt. Smoking reduction may be a viable treatment approach if proven to increase the rates of long-term abstinence from smoking. METHOD: A systematic review of randomized, controlled trials that tested smoking-reduction interventions (pharmacological, behavioral, or both combined) among smokers who were not ready to make a quit attempt (immediately or in the next month) was conducted to assess the efficacy of these strategies in promoting future smoking abstinence. The primary outcome was the 7-day point-prevalence smoking abstinence at longest follow-up (>/=6months). Ten trials were included; six tested pharmacologic interventions, one evaluated a behavioral intervention, and three evaluated combined interventions. RESULTS: Pharmacologic (2732 participants; OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.79) and combined (638 participants; OR 2.14, 95% CI: 1.28 to 3.60) smoking-reduction interventions significantly increased long-term abstinence from smoking. Insufficient evidence was available on the efficacy of behavioral smoking-reduction interventions (320 participants; OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.56 to 3.93). CONCLUSIONS: Further research to evaluate the efficacy of smoking reduction should have cessation as an endpoint, focus on clarity and consistency in patient selection, and identify the mechanism through which nicotine replacement therapy assisted smoking reduction in increasing abstinence rates.

Abstract:Autotaxin (ATX, NPP2) is a member of the nucleotide pyrophosphate phosphodiesterase enzyme family. ATX catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) by lysophospholipase D activity, which leads to generation of the growth-factor-like lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). ATX is highly upregulated in metastatic and chemotherapy-resistant carcinomas and represents a potential target to mediate cancer invasion and metastasis. Herein we report the synthesis and pharmacological characterization of ATX inhibitors based on the 4-tetradecanoylaminobenzylphosphonic acid scaffold, which was previously found to lack sufficient stability in cellular systems. The new 4-substituted benzylphosphonic acid and 6-substituted naphthalen-2-ylmethylphosphonic acid analogues block ATX activity with K(i) values in the low micromolar to nanomolar range against FS3, LPC, and nucleotide substrates through a mixed-mode inhibition mechanism. None of the compounds tested inhibit the activity of related enzymes (NPP6 and NPP7). In addition, the compounds were evaluated as agonists or antagonists of seven LPA receptor (LPAR) subtypes. Analogues 22 and 30 b, the two most potent ATX inhibitors, inhibit the invasion of MM1 hepatoma cells across murine mesothelial and human vascular endothelial monolayers in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. The average terminal half-life for compound 22 is 10+/-5.4 h and it causes a long-lasting decrease in plasma LPA levels. Compounds 22 and 30 b significantly decrease lung metastasis of B16-F10 syngeneic mouse melanoma in a post-inoculation treatment paradigm. The 4-substituted benzylphosphonic acids and 6-substituted naphthalen-2-ylmethylphosphonic acids described herein represent new lead compounds that effectively inhibit the ATX-LPA-LPAR axis both in vitro and in vivo.

Title:Viscoelastic properties of injectable bone cements for orthopaedic applications: state-of-the-art review.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:Injectable bone cements (IBCs) are used for a variety of orthopaedic applications, examples being poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cements used for anchoring total joint replacements (TJRs) (high load-bearing application), PMMA bone cements used in the vertebral body augmentation procedures of vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) (medium load-bearing application), and calcium phosphate-based and calcium sulfate-based cements used as bone void fillers/bone graft substitutes (low load-bearing application). For each of these applications, the viscoelastic properties of the cement are very important. For example, (1) creep of the cement has an influence on the longevity of a cemented TJR (for example, creep allows the cement to remodel, thereby maximizing the contact area of the cement-bone interface and, hence, minimizing stress concentration at that interface); and (2) in VP and BKP, the likelihood of cement extravasation is directly related to the profile of the viscosity-versus-time elapsed from commencement of mixing of the cement. There are a few reviews of the literature on a number of viscoelastic properties of some IBCs but a comprehensive review of the literature on all viscoelastic properties of all IBCs is lacking. The objective of this contribution is to present such a review. In addition, a number of ideas for future study in the field of viscoelastic properties of IBCs are described.

Abstract:The North American Guidelines for Children's Agricultural Tasks (NAGCAT) were developed to reduce childhood agricultural injuries by assisting adults in assigning appropriate chores and providing needed supervision and training. To develop an effective intervention to increase adherence to NAGCAT among farm parents, formative research (focus groups and pilot-testing) was conducted. Protection motivation theory (PMT) was used to guide this research and inform intervention development. Focus group results suggested how PMT constructs might be addressed to increase adherence. A home visit intervention, using a standardized presentation in POWERPoint, was developed to (a) introduce NAGCAT, (b) increase motivation to use NAGCAT and enhance safe work behaviors, and (c) ultimately reduce agricultural work-related injuries among youth. Process evaluation data suggests that the intervention was well received by farm parents. Conducting theory-guided formative research identified motivational barriers and strategies for overcoming these barriers that might not have been otherwise apparent.

Title:Cochlear dead regions in typical hearing aid candidates: prevalence and implications for use of high-frequency speech cues.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC', 'Johnson J', 'Rivera I']
Affiliation:School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. robyncox@memphis.edu
Abstract:OBJECTIVES: This study had two purposes. The first was to assess the prevalence of cochlear dead regions (DRs) among listeners with moderate to severe hearing loss that is typical of a large proportion of adult hearing aid wearers. The second was to determine whether subjects who tested positive for DRs differed from those without DRs in their ability to utilize high-frequency speech cues in a laboratory test. DESIGN: One hundred and seventy adults (307 ears) were tested for DRs at frequencies from 0.5 to 4 kHz using the threshold equalizing noise (HL) test. Speech recognition ability was measured for high-frequency emphasis (HFE) stimuli and for low-pass filtered HFE (HFE-LP) stimuli using the Quick Speech In Noise test. Results obtained from the HFE and HFE-LP conditions were compared to examine changes in word recognition when more speech cues were provided above 2.5 kHz. Possible effects of audiogram differences between DR-no and DR-yes groups were examined by estimating the change in audibility for the two Quick Speech In Noise conditions using calculated differences in Speech Intelligibility Index for each condition for every subject. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of subjects (23% of ears) were found to have a DR at one or more test frequencies. Sixty-eight percent of subjects who tested positive for DR had DRs in one ear only. DRs were most prevalent at frequencies above 1.5 kHz. Comparison of word recognition scores obtained with the HFE and HFE-LP conditions revealed that, on average, both groups scored significantly better when more high-frequency cues were provided. The magnitude of the benefit was small for both groups, but the computed effect size was larger for listeners without DRs than for those with DRs. Further, subjects with contiguous DRs at 2 to 3 frequencies obtained less benefit than subjects with DRs at isolated frequencies. It was determined that the improved audibility of high-frequency cues in the HFE condition was significantly less for listeners with DRs, and this accounted for some, but not all, of the difference in effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Although about one-third of listeners with flat or sloping moderate to severe hearing losses tested positive for at least one DR, there was no evidence to support a proposal for reducing high-frequency gain in hearing aid fittings for these types of listeners. Making high frequencies more audible was helpful, on average, regardless of DR status. It is recommended that field trials be undertaken in which subjects with and without DRs wear hearing aids in daily life. This type of study would produce higher level evidence about best practice in hearing aid fitting for patients with flat or sloping moderate to severe hearing loss who test positive for DRs.

Title:Effects of an early handling-like procedure and individual housing on anxiety-like behavior in adult C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice.

Abstract:Manipulations of rearing conditions have been used to examine the effects of early experience on adult behavior with varying results. Evidence suggests that postnatal days (PND) 15-21 are a time of particular susceptibility to environmental influences on anxiety-like behavior in mice. To examine this, we subjected C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice to an early handling-like procedure. Pups were separated from dams from PND 12-20 for 30 minutes daily or received standard care. On PND 21, pups were weaned and either individually- or group-housed. On PND 60, anxiety-like behavior was examined on the elevated zero-maze. Although individually-housed animals took longer to enter an open quadrant of the maze, they spent more time in the open than group-housed animals. Additionally, we observed a trend of reduced anxiety-like behavior in C57BL/6J, but not DBA/2J mice that underwent the handling-like procedure.

Abstract:UNLABELLED: High-throughput genomic technologies enable researchers to identify genes that are co-regulated with respect to specific experimental conditions. Numerous statistical approaches have been developed to identify differentially expressed genes. Because each approach can produce distinct gene sets, it is difficult for biologists to determine which statistical approach yields biologically relevant gene sets and is appropriate for their study. To address this issue, we implemented Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to determine the functional coherence of gene sets. An LSI model was built using over 1 million Medline abstracts for over 20,000 mouse and human genes annotated in Entrez Gene. The gene-to-gene LSI-derived similarities were used to calculate a literature cohesion p-value (LPv) for a given gene set using a Fisher's exact test. We tested this method against genes in more than 6,000 functional pathways annotated in Gene Ontology (GO) and found that approximately 75% of gene sets in GO biological process category and 90% of the gene sets in GO molecular function and cellular component categories were functionally cohesive (LPv<0.05). These results indicate that the LPv methodology is both robust and accurate. Application of this method to previously published microarray datasets demonstrated that LPv can be helpful in selecting the appropriate feature extraction methods. To enable real-time calculation of LPv for mouse or human gene sets, we developed a web tool called Gene-set Cohesion Analysis Tool (GCAT). GCAT can complement other gene set enrichment approaches by determining the overall functional cohesion of data sets, taking into account both explicit and implicit gene interactions reported in the biomedical literature.

Abstract:Size-selective pores in the shells of hollow polymer nanocapsules enable combined assembly and entrapment of molecules. Small building blocks enter the capsule through the pores. The assembled molecules, which are larger than the pores, remain entrapped in the nanocapsules. Porous nanometre-thin walls permit unhindered functionalization of entrapped molecules.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Local drug delivery has substantial potential to prevent infections compared with systemic delivery. Although calcium sulfate (CaSO(4)) has been studied for local drug delivery and two types are commercially available, it is unknown whether they differentially release antibiotics. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We determined the differences between two sources of CaSO(4) and the K(2)SO(4) catalyst's presence on the degradation, daptomycin elution, and activity against Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: We formed pellets from synthetic and naturally sourced (from gypsum) CaSO(4) and loaded with 5% daptomycin and 3% or 0% K(2)SO(4). We used in vitro experiments to determine the daptomycin concentration and degradation profiles over 10 days. Turbidity assays were used to evaluate the activity of the daptomycin eluates against S. aureus. RESULTS: All pellets exhibited a bolus release with the highest daptomycin concentration on Day 1 with the sourced CaSO(4) pellets. The synthetic CaSO(4) pellets with 3% K(2)SO(4) exhibited a slower drug release compared with the synthetic CaSO(4) pellets with 0% K(2)SO(4), which degraded and eluted daptomycin too quickly to inhibit S. aureus. Turbidity assays demonstrated that all CaSO(4) pellets inhibit S. aureus for expected lengths of time. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary in vitro data suggest differences in the degradation, elution, and activity properties between sourced and synthetic CaSO(4) pellets. The addition of K(2)SO(4) appeared beneficial when using synthetic CaSO(4). Synthetic CaSO(4) may be effective when slow degradation and longer elution times are needed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Local delivery of eluted daptomycin can be tailored through material selection and K(2)SO(4) addition.

Abstract:Production of cytokines by immune cells in response to stimuli and the binding of cytokines to specific receptors on target cells is a central feature of the immune response. The IL-12 cytokine family is particularly influential in determining the fate of T cells and is characterized by the sharing of cytokine and receptor subunits. A thorough understanding of the molecular interactions within this family will be a key to the development of therapeutic inhibitors or enhancers of IL-12 family function. While the current structural and molecular data for IL-12 family members is limited, there is ample information on the structurally related IL-6 cytokine family. This review will summarize the current structural and mutagenesis data within the IL-12 family and will attempt to utilize similarities between the IL-6 and IL-12 families to understand molecular interactions between IL-12 family subunits and with receptor components.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES: To identify attributes of medication therapy management (MTM) valued by Medicare beneficiaries and to determine patient preferences and willingness to pay for MTM attributes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional contingency valuation study. SETTING: Six senior centers in Memphis, TN, from September 2007 through August 2008. PARTICIPANTS: 355 Medicare beneficiaries. INTERVENTION: A discrete choice experiment was used, in which each study participant was asked to choose from two different hypothetical MTM services defined by seven attributes (service setting, provider type, number of drug therapy problems, provider experience in overall practice, provider experience in geriatrics, time spent, and cost of MTM service) and associated levels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient preferences for different attributes of MTM services and patients' estimated marginal willingness to pay for each attribute level. RESULTS: Study participants viewed cost (relative importance 32.2%) as the most important attribute of MTM, followed by service setting (24.2%), provider experience in overall practice (19.5%), and provider experience in geriatrics (16.6%). Community pharmacies (beta = 0.146, P = 0.007) were the most preferred environment for MTM services, followed by clinics, whereas telephone consultation was the least preferred environment (beta = -0.349, P < 0.001). Study participants were willing to spend as much as $31.76 (95% CI 19.84-45.27) to trade telephone MTM for clinic-based MTM. They also were willing to pay $13.31 more (3.60-23.65) for MTM service at a community pharmacy compared with clinic-based MTM. CONCLUSION: Health plans should consider developing community pharmacy-based MTM options, at least for Medicare beneficiaries without mobility limitations.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study compared adherence and persistence rates among MDD patients with comorbid chronic pain-related diseases (CPD, including fibromyalgia, diabetes with neurological manifestations, osteoarthritis, low back pain, and headache) for three antidepressants: duloxetine, venlafaxine XR, and escitalopram. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 15,523 adult MDD patients with CPD in the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database who started on one of the study medications between 07/01/06 and 06/30/07. Patients were followed-up for 6 months. Adherence was reported using a medication possession ratio >/=0.8. Persistence was measured using persistence rates (proportions of patients who continuously refilled prescriptions during 6 months) and duration of therapy (number of days patients remained on the study medication before a prescription gap over 30 days). Multivariate logistic regression on adherence and persistence rates and linear regression on duration of therapy adjusting for patient and prescription characteristics were conducted. RESULTS: Patients on duloxetine had a higher adherence rate (46.03%) than those on venlafaxine XR (42.94%; p = 0.0033) or escitalopram (37.27%; p < 0.0001). Patients on duloxetine also had a higher persistence rate and longer duration of therapy (43.66%, 117.82 days) than did patients treated with venlafaxine XR (40.38%; p = 0.0017; 114.24 days; p = 0.009) or escitalopram (33.86%; p < 0.0001; 105.73 days; p < 0.0001). These differences were still significant after adjusting for patient and prescription characteristics (p < 0.05). Sensitivity analyses found similar patterns using an allowable gap for refill of 15 days. CONCLUSIONS: Among commercially insured MDD patients with CPD, duloxetine-treated patients had higher adherence and persistence rates than did patients treated with venlafaxine XR or escitalopram during 6 months after medication initiation. Future studies should examine the clinical and economic implications of these differences. LIMITATIONS: This study has limitations such as possible selection bias using secondary database analysis.

Abstract:PURPOSE: This study evaluates the role of older family members as providers of social resources within familial network systems affected by an inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome. DESIGN AND METHODS: Respondents who previously participated in a study that involved genetic counseling and testing for Lynch syndrome and their family network members were invited to participate in a onetime telephone interview about family communication. RESULTS: A total of 206 respondents from 33 families identified 2,051 social relationships (dyads). Nineteen percent of the respondents and 25% of the network members were older (>/=60 years). Younger respondents (</=59 years) were more likely to nominate older network members as providers of social resources than younger members: instrumental support (odds ratio [OR] = 1.68), emotional support (OR = 1.71), help in crisis situation (OR = 2.04), and dependability when needed (OR = 2.15). Compared with younger network members, older members were more likely to be listed as encouragers of colon cancer screening by both younger (OR = 3.40) and older respondents (OR = 1.90) independent of whether support exchange occurred in the relationship. IMPLICATIONS: Engaging older network members in health interventions to facilitate screening behaviors and emotional well-being of younger members within families affected by inherited conditions may be beneficial. Findings can be used to empower older individuals about their important social roles in enhancing the well-being of their family members and to inform younger individuals about their older relatives' resourcefulness to facilitate positive social interactions.

Title:Effects of ambiguous gestures and language on the time course of reference resolution.
Authors:['Louwerse MM', 'Bangerter A']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis Department of Applied Psychology, University of Neuchatel.
Abstract:Two eye-tracking experiments investigated how and when pointing gestures and location descriptions affect target identification. The experiments investigated the effect of gestures and referring expressions on the time course of fixations to the target, using videos of human gestures and human voice, and animated gestures and synthesized speech. Ambiguous, yet informative pointing gestures elicited attention and facilitated target identification, akin to verbal location descriptions. Moreover, target identification was superior when both pointing gestures and verbal location descriptions were used. These findings suggest that gesture not only operates as a context to verbal descriptions, or that verbal descriptions operate as a context to gesture, but that they complement one another in reference resolution.

Abstract:Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients make antibodies to heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein A1 (hnRNP-A1), a nucleocytoplasmic protein. We hypothesized this autoimmune reaction might contribute to neurodegeneration. Antibodies from MS patients reacted with hnRNP-A1-'M9', its nuclear translocation sequence. Transfection of anti-M9 antibodies into neurons resulted in neuronal injury and changes in transcripts related to hnRNP-A1 function. Importantly, RNA levels for the spinal paraplegia genes (SPGs) decreased. Changes in SPG RNA levels were confirmed in neurons purified from MS brains. Also, we show molecular interactions between spastin (the encoded protein of SPG4) and hnRNP-A1. These data suggest a link between autoimmunity, clinical phenotype and neurodegeneration in MS.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Sickle-cell anaemia is associated with substantial morbidity from acute complications and organ dysfunction beginning in the first year of life. Hydroxycarbamide substantially reduces episodes of pain and acute chest syndrome, admissions to hospital, and transfusions in adults with sickle-cell anaemia. We assessed the effect of hydroxycarbamide therapy on organ dysfunction and clinical complications, and examined laboratory findings and toxic effects. METHODS: This randomised trial was undertaken in 13 centres in the USA between October, 2003, and September, 2009. Eligible participants had haemoglobin SS (HbSS) or haemoglobin Sbeta(0)thalassaemia, were aged 9-18 months at randomisation, and were not selected for clinical severity. Participants received liquid hydroxycarbamide, 20 mg/kg per day, or placebo for 2 years. Randomisation assignments were generated by the medical coordinating centre by a pre-decided schedule. Identical appearing and tasting formulations were used for hydroxycarbamide and placebo. Patients, caregivers, and coordinating centre staff were masked to treatment allocation. Primary study endpoints were splenic function (qualitative uptake on (99)Tc spleen scan) and renal function (glomerular filtration rate by (99m)Tc-DTPA clearance). Additional assessments included blood counts, fetal haemoglobin concentration, chemistry profiles, spleen function biomarkers, urine osmolality, neurodevelopment, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, growth, and mutagenicity. Study visits occurred every 2-4 weeks. Analysis was by intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00006400. FINDINGS: 96 patients received hydroxycarbamide and 97 placebo, of whom 83 patients in the hydroxycarbamide group and 84 in the placebo group completed the study. Significant differences were not seen between groups for the primary endpoints (19 of 70 patients with decreased spleen function at exit in the hydroxycarbamide group vs 28 of 74 patients in the placebo group, p=0.21; and a difference in the mean increase in DTPA glomerular filtration rate in the hydroxycarbamide group versus the placebo group of 2 mL/min per 1.73 m(2), p=0.84). Hydroxycarbamide significantly decreased pain (177 events in 62 patients vs 375 events in 75 patients in the placebo group, p=0.002) and dactylitis (24 events in 14 patients vs 123 events in 42 patients in the placebo group, p<0.0001), with some evidence for decreased acute chest syndrome, hospitalisation rates, and transfusion. Hydroxyurea increased haemoglobin and fetal haemoglobin, and decreased white blood-cell count. Toxicity was limited to mild-to-moderate neutropenia. INTERPRETATION: On the basis of the safety and efficacy data from this trial, hydroxycarbamide can now be considered for all very young children with sickle-cell anaemia.

Title:Transformation invariant on-line target recognition.
Authors:['Iftekharuddin KM']
Affiliation:Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. iftekhar@memphis.edu
Abstract:Transformation invariant automatic target recognition (ATR) has been an active research area due to its widespread applications in defense, robotics, medical imaging and geographic scene analysis. The primary goal for this paper is to obtain an on-line ATR system for targets in presence of image transformations, such as rotation, translation, scale and occlusion as well as resolution changes. We investigate biologically inspired adaptive critic design (ACD) neural network (NN) models for on-line learning of such transformations. We further exploit reinforcement learning (RL) in ACD framework to obtain transformation invariant ATR. We exploit two ACD designs, such as heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) and dual heuristic dynamic programming (DHP) to obtain transformation invariant ATR. We obtain extensive statistical evaluations of proposed on-line ATR networks using both simulated image transformations and real benchmark facial image database, UMIST, with pose variations. Our simulations show promising results for learning transformations in simulated images and authenticating out-of plane rotated face images. Comparing the two on-line ATR designs, HDP outperforms DHP in learning capability and robustness and is more tolerant to noise. The computational time involved in HDP is also less than that of DHP. On the other hand, DHP achieves a 100% success rate more frequently than HDP for individual targets, and the residual critic error in DHP is generally smaller than that of HDP. Mathematical analyses of both our RL-based on-line ATR designs are also obtained to provide a sufficient condition for asymptotic convergence in a statistical average sense.

Title:Physician communication regarding smoking and adolescent tobacco use.
Authors:['Hum AM', 'Robinson LA', 'Jackson AA', 'Ali KS']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Physician advice increases quit rates 1% to 3% above unassisted quit rates among adults, an increase sufficient to be ranked as a high-priority, evidence-based preventive service. However, there is little research on the potential impact of physician advice on adolescent smoking. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between recalled physician communication and adolescents' attitudes toward smoking, knowledge about smoking, intentions to smoke, tobacco use, and quitting behaviors. METHODS: This study was a retrospective observational study of 5154 students (82.9% black, 17.1% white) from an urban, mid-South school system. Outcome variables included adolescents' self-rated attitudes toward smoking, knowledge about smoking, intentions to smoke, tobacco use, and quitting behaviors. RESULTS: Physician advice and the combination of screening and advice were associated with healthier attitudes about smoking. Physician screening and advice were also associated with a more accurate knowledge regarding tobacco-related damage. Among current smokers, recalled physician advice was also associated with reduced intentions to smoke in 5 years. Importantly, advised teens were more likely to plan to quit smoking in 6 months. Furthermore, teens who were screened by their physician reported significantly more quit attempts than those who were neither screened nor advised (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Physician's tobacco-related interactions with adolescents seemed to positively impact their attitudes, knowledge, intentions to smoke, and quitting behaviors. Brief physician interventions have the potential to be a key intervention on a public health level through the prevention, cessation, and reduction of smoking and smoking-related disease.

Title:Language encodes geographical information.
Authors:['Louwerse MM', 'Zwaan RA']
Affiliation:University of Memphis Erasmus University Rotterdam.
Abstract:Population counts and longitude and latitude coordinates were estimated for the 50 largest cities in the United States by computational linguistic techniques and by human participants. The mathematical technique Latent Semantic Analysis applied to newspaper texts produced similarity ratings between the 50 cities that allowed for a multidimensional scaling (MDS) of these cities. MDS coordinates correlated with the actual longitude and latitude of these cities, showing that cities that are located together share similar semantic contexts. This finding was replicated using a first-order co-occurrence algorithm. The computational estimates of geographical location as well as population were akin to human estimates. These findings show that language encodes geographical information that language users in turn may use in their understanding of language and the world.

Title:An empirical and computational investigation of perceiving and remembering event temporal relations.
Authors:['Lu S', 'Harter D', 'Graesser AC']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Texas A&M University-Commerce Department of Computer Science, Texas A&M University-Commerce Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis.
Abstract:Events have beginnings, ends, and often overlap in time. A major question is how perceivers come to parse a stream of multimodal information into meaningful units and how different event boundaries may vary event processing. This work investigates the roles of these three types of event boundaries in constructing event temporal relations. Predictions were made based on how people would err according to the beginning state, end state, and overlap heuristic hypotheses. Participants viewed animated events that include all the logical possibilities of event temporal relations, and then made temporal relation judgments. The results showed that people make use of the overlap between events and take into account the ends and beginnings, but they weight ends more than beginnings. Neural network simulations showed a self-organized distinction when learning temporal relations between events with overlap versus those without.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to perform and evaluate baseline abdominal ultrasound in infants with sickle cell anemia who participated in the BABY HUG multiinstitutional randomized placebo-controlled trial of hydroxyurea therapy and to examine the potential relationships among ultrasound results and clinical, nuclear medicine, and laboratory data. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After local institutional review board approval and with informed guardian consent, 116 girls and 87 boys (age range, 7.5-18 months) with sickle cell anemia underwent standardized abdominal sonography at 14 institutions. Imaging was centrally reviewed by one radiologist who assessed and measured the spleen, kidneys, gallbladder, and common bile duct. Baseline physical assessment of spleen size, serum alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin levels, (99m)Tc sulfur colloid liver-spleen scans, and (99m)Tc diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid clearance glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) were obtained. Analysis of variance and the Student test were performed to compare sonographic findings to published results in healthy children and to clinical and laboratory findings. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) spleen volume (108 +/- 47 mL) was significantly greater than published normal control values (30 +/- 14 mL; p < 0.0001). There was no correlation between spleen volume and function assessed by liver-spleen scan. The mean GFR (125 +/- 34 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was elevated compared with control GFRs (92 +/- 18 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Renal volumes (right kidney, 29 +/- 8 mL; left kidney, 31 +/- 9 mL) were significantly greater than control volumes (right kidney, 27 +/- 3 mL; left kidney, 27 +/- 3 mL; p < 0.0001) and were positively correlated with GFR (p = 0.0009). Five percent of patients had sonographic biliary abnormalities (sludge, n = 6; dilated common bile duct, n = 2; and cholelithiasis and thickened gallbladder wall, n = 1 each). There was no correlation between biliary sonographic findings and laboratory results. CONCLUSION: In infants with sickle cell anemia, sonographic spleen volume does not reflect function, but increased renal volume correlates with GFR and is consistent with hyperfiltration. Sonographic biliary abnormalities can occur early in life, while remaining clinically silent.

Abstract:PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Understanding the demographic history of natural populations in relation to the geographic features in their habitats is an important step toward deciphering the mechanisms of evolutionary processes in nature. This study investigates how the complex geographic and ecological features of the Andes play a role in demographic history, species divergence, dispersal patterns, and hybridization in wild tomato species. METHODS: We investigated spatial genetics of two closely related wild tomato species, Solanum lycopersicum and S. pimpinellifolium, by integrating amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) marker data and geographic information system (GIS)-derived geographic and climatic data. KEY RESULTS: The two species represent genetically distinct lineages largely separated by the Andes, but hybridize extensively in central to northern Ecuador, likely mediated by the transitional climatic conditions between those of the two species. Solanum lycospericum has likely experienced a severe population bottleneck during the colonization of the eastern Andes followed by a rapid population expansion. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that the evolutionary patterns of the two wild tomatoes, including demographic history, dispersal patterns, interspecific divergence, and hybridization, are intimately related to the complex geographic and ecological features of the Andes. Integrating genetic data across the genome and GIS-derived environmental data can provide insights into the patterns of complex evolutionary processes in nature.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between bone mineral density (BMD) and muscle strength in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), a population at increased risk for both decreased BMD and muscle strength from cancer and its treatment. DESIGN: Cohort data from the St Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) study. SETTING: Department of Cancer Control at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were adults enrolled in St Jude Lifetime Cohort study and treated for childhood ALL between 1962 and 1999. As part of a comprehensive evaluation, participants had dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans and muscle strength testing. The participants consisted of 261 women and 232 men who were 20.4 to 49.8 years old (median, 35.7y), and 12.7 to 46.5 years from diagnosis of childhood ALL (median, 27.2y). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BMD was determined by DEXA scan. Muscle strength of upper and lower extremities was assessed with physical performance testing. RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, we found significant (P<0.005) associations between BMD and muscle strength in lower extremities (R(2) range, 0.33-0.40) and strong, significant associations in upper extremities (left-side R(2)=0.558; right-side R(2)=0.560). CONCLUSIONS: Muscle strength was associated with BMD in the extremities of long-term survivors of childhood ALL, a finding suggesting that muscle strengthening interventions may improve bone health in them.

Title:Ecological and geographic modes of species divergence in wild tomatoes.
Authors:['Nakazato T', 'Warren DL', 'Moyle LC']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152 USA.
Abstract:Understanding the role of geography and ecology in species divergence is central to the study of evolutionary diversification. We used climatic, geographic, and biological data from nine wild Andean tomato species to describe each species' ecological niche and to evaluate the likely ecological and geographical modes of speciation in this clade. Using data from >1000 wild accessions and publicly available data derived from geographic information systems for various environmental variables, we found most species pairs were significantly differentiated for one or more environmental variables. By comparing species' predicted niches generated by species distribution modeling (SDM), we found significant niche differentiation among three of four sister-species pairs, suggesting ecological divergence is consistently associated with recent divergence. In comparison, based on age-range correlation (ARC) analysis, there was no evidence for a predominant geographical (allopatric vs. sympatric) context for speciation in this group. Overall, our results suggest an important role for environmentally mediated differentiation, rather than simply geographical isolation, in species divergence.

Abstract:It is often assumed that engaging in a one-on-one dialogue with a tutor is more effective than listening to a lecture or reading a text. Although earlier experiments have not always supported this hypothesis, this may be due in part to allowing the tutors to cover different content than the noninteractive instruction. In 7 experiments, we tested the interaction hypothesis under the constraint that (a) all students covered the same content during instruction, (b) the task domain was qualitative physics, (c) the instruction was in natural language as opposed to mathematical or other formal languages, and (d) the instruction conformed with a widely observed pattern in human tutoring: Graesser, Person, and Magliano's 5-step frame. In the experiments, we compared 2 kinds of human tutoring (spoken and computer mediated) with 2 kinds of natural-language-based computer tutoring (Why2-Atlas and Why2-AutoTutor) and 3 control conditions that involved studying texts. The results depended on whether the students' preparation matched the content of the instruction. When novices (students who had not taken college physics) studied content that was written for intermediates (students who had taken college physics), then tutorial dialogue was reliably more beneficial than less interactive instruction, with large effect sizes. When novices studied material written for novices or intermediates studied material written for intermediates, then tutorial dialogue was not reliably more effective than the text-based control conditions.

Title:Connecting the dots of the cerebro-cerebellar role in cognitive function: neuronal pathways for cerebellar modulation of dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex.

Abstract:Cerebellar involvement in autism, schizophrenia, and other cognitive disorders is typically associated with prefrontal cortical pathology. However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are largely unknown. It has previously been shown in mice that stimulation of the dentate nucleus (DN) of the cerebellum evokes dopamine (DA) release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here, we investigated the neuronal circuitry by which the cerebellum modulates mPFC DA release. Fixed potential amperometry was used to determine the contribution of two candidate pathways by which the cerebellum may modulate mPFC DA release. In urethane anesthetized mice, DA release evoked by DN stimulation (50 Hz) was recorded in mPFC following local anesthetic lidocaine (0.02 mug) or ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate (0.5 mug) infusions into the mediodorsal or ventrolateral thalamic nucleus (ThN md; ThN vl), or the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Following intra-VTA lidocaine or kynurenate infusions, DA release was decreased by approximately 50%. Following intra-ThN md and ThN vl infusions of either drug, DA release was decreased by approximately 35% and 15%, respectively. Reductions in DA release following lidocaine or kynurenate infusions were not significantly different indicating that neuronal cells in the VTA and ThN were activated primarily if not entirely by glutamatergic inputs. The present study suggests that neuropathological changes in the cerebellum commonly observed in autism, schizophrenia, and other cognitive disorders could result in a loss of functionality of cerebellar-mPFC circuitry that is manifested as aberrant dopaminergic activity in the mPFC. Additionally, these results specifically implicate glutamate as a modulator of mPFC dopaminergic activity.

Title:A chronoamperometric method to estimate ionophore loss from ion-selective electrode membranes.
Authors:['Pendley BD', 'Lindner E']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, Rhodes College, 2000 North Parkway, Memphis, Tennessee 38112.
Abstract:A novel chronoamperometric method was developed to estimate the concentration of a neutral ionophore in fixed-site, dioctyl sebacate plasticized, poly(vinyl chloride)-based, ion-selective electrode membranes. The membranes contained between 0.5 and 16 mmol/kg valinomycin. The chronoamperometric technique was used to estimate the valinomycin concentration in freshly prepared membranes and after extraction of some of the ionophore from the membranes using dioctyl sebacate. Replicate measurements indicated a relative standard deviation in the calculated valinomycin concentration of less than 10%, and these values accurately represented the true concentration of valinomycin within 10%. The method permitted an estimate of the valinomycin concentration after valinomycin was leached from a membrane. The results of preliminary experiments using heparinized dog blood suggest that blood protein adsorption does not interfere qualitatively or quantitatively with the analysis.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To characterize therapy-induced changes in normal-appearing brainstems of childhood brain tumor patients by serial diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: We analyzed 109 DTI studies from 20 brain tumor patients, aged 4 to 23 years, with normal-appearing brainstems included in the treatment fields. Those with medulloblastomas, supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (n = 10) received postoperative craniospinal irradiation (23.4-39.6 Gy) and a cumulative dose of 55.8 Gy to the primary site, followed by four cycles of high-dose chemotherapy. Patients with high-grade gliomas (n = 10) received erlotinib during and after irradiation (54-59.4 Gy). Parametric maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were computed and spatially registered to three-dimensional radiation dose data. Volumes of interest included corticospinal tracts, medial lemnisci, and the pons. Serving as an age-related benchmark for comparison, 37 DTI studies from 20 healthy volunteers, aged 6 to 25 years, were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The median DTI follow-up time was 3.5 years (range, 1.6-5.0 years). The median mean dose to the pons was 56 Gy (range, 7-59 Gy). Three patterns were seen in longitudinal FA and apparent diffusion coefficient changes: (1) a stable or normal developing time trend, (2) initial deviation from normal with subsequent recovery, and (3) progressive deviation without evidence of complete recovery. The maximal decline in FA often occurred 1.5 to 3.5 years after the start of radiation therapy. A full recovery time trend could be observed within 4 years. Patients with incomplete recovery often had a larger decline in FA within the first year. Radiation dose alone did not predict long-term recovery patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Variations existed among individual patients after therapy in longitudinal evolution of brainstem white matter injury and recovery. Early response in brainstem anisotropy may serve as an indicator of the recovery time trend over 5 years after radiation therapy.

Title:Food supplementation experiments: A tool to reveal mechanisms that mediate timing of reproduction.
Authors:['Schoech SJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Food supplementation of free-living animals has been used to address the role of availability of resources in the timing of reproduction. A meta-analysis by Schoech and Hahn suggested that responsiveness of the reproductive axis to the supplementary cue of food is lessened at higher latitudes, presumably because the brief time during which conditions are appropriate to rear offspring has led to an evolved resistance to supplementary cues with a primary reliance on photoperiod. Unfortunately, few investigators have examined the potential underlying mechanisms that mediate this differential responsiveness to supplemental food across latitudes. Considerable research, however, links nutritional state and plasma glucocorticoid levels, both of which impinge upon the reproductive axis. Long-term research on Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) in my laboratory shows that suburban birds with access to ad libitum supplemental food express early breeding and lower plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels in comparison to jays in nearby natural habitat. Furthermore, supplementation in natural habitat advances laying, with the largest effects occurring in bad years (i.e., years defined by late breeding and poor reproductive output by non-supplemented controls). Similarly, reproductive output of supplemented jays is greater and exhibits considerably less variance than do controls, suggesting fitness benefits of supplementation that are tied to advanced breeding. Generally, CORT levels in early-breeding supplemented jays are lower than are those of controls. Also, regression analysis suggests that clutch-initiation dates of non-supplemented female breeders are predicted by baseline CORT levels. Although these data are not conclusive and trends can be obscured by year-effects, they suggest a role for CORT in timing of breeding. Whether this link might help to explain the above-referenced latitudinal trends remains to be characterized.

Abstract:We developed 'clipping reveals structure' (CREST), an algorithm that uses next-generation sequencing reads with partial alignments to a reference genome to directly map structural variations at the nucleotide level of resolution. Application of CREST to whole-genome sequencing data from five pediatric T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) and a human melanoma cell line, COLO-829, identified 160 somatic structural variations. Experimental validation exceeded 80%, demonstrating that CREST had a high predictive accuracy.

Title:Emerging antibacterial biomaterial strategies for the prevention of peri-implant inflammatory diseases.
Authors:['Bumgardner JD', 'Adatrow P', 'Haggard WO', 'Norowski PA']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, TN, USA. jbmgrdnr@memphis.edu
Abstract:PURPOSE: Peri-implantitis is an inflammatory disease due to bacteria and plaque formation on implant surfaces which can lead to bone resorption and loss of osseointegration. Biomaterial strategies to prevent or eliminate initial bacterial attachment, in favor of host tissue attachment may have a positive effect on decreasing peri-implantitis, particularly for at risk patient groups. This study provides a brief overview of some of the experimental biomaterial strategies aimed at suppressing or inhibiting bacterial colonization of implant surfaces in favor or host cells and tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: These biomaterial strategies have different mechanisms of action from interfering with bacterial adhesion by modifying surface energies, immobilizing antimicrobials on implant surfaces, creating photocatalytic surfaces, as well as modifying surfaces to deliver antimicrobial agents either prophylactically or in response to bacterial challenge. This is not a comprehensive review, rather a review of studies that serve to illustrate many of the different approaches being investigated. RESULTS: While many of these strategies have demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce bacterial attachment on implant surfaces in vitro, it is unclear if these same reductions will be adequate clinically since even a few adhering bacteria may over time develop into inflammatory inducing biofilms or plaque. Also, data on the ability of the antibacterial modified biomaterials to support osseointegration and permuosal seal formation is still needed. CONCLUSION: Given the complex and multivariate causes of peri-implant disease, it is likely that combinations of these strategies (eg, antimicrobial surfaces and or delivery mechanisms coupled with methods to favor stable osseointegration and permucosal seal) will be most effective in developing implants resistant to peri-implant disease.

Title:Does combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients? A cost-utility study.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Combining various antiretroviral agents into one single dosage form has been a strategy to reduce pill burden and enhance medication adherence among human immunodeficiency virus /AIDS (HIV/AIDS) patients. OBJECTIVES: This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy. METHOD: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with >/=2 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique. RESULTS: Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with >/=2 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold. CONCLUSION: Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.

Title:Forskolin stimulates prostaglandin synthesis in rabbit heart by a mechanism that requires calcium and is independent of cyclic AMP.
Authors:['Williams JL Jr', 'Malik KU']
Affiliation:Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163.
Abstract:Infusion of forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, in concentrations (2 microM) that do not alter basal prostaglandin (PG) synthesis inhibit synthesis of PG elicited by isoproterenol in rabbit heart. This inhibitory action of forskolin appears to be dependent on cyclic AMP (cAMP). Bolus injection of forskolin (75 nmol), however, was found to stimulate PG synthesis in rabbit heart. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of the stimulatory action of forskolin on PG synthesis (prostaglandin I2 measured as 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha [6-keto-PGF1 alpha]) in isolated perfused rabbit heart. Forskolin enhanced PG production in a dose-dependent manner. 1,9-Dideoxyforskolin, a forskolin analogue devoid of adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity, also enhanced PG synthesis. The cAMP analogue chlorophenylthio-cAMP failed to stimulate output of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, although this agent produced dose-related changes in mechanical function in rabbit heart. Furthermore, the adenylate cyclase inhibitor (-)-N6-(R-phenylisopropyl)adenosine potentiated, whereas the phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostamide attenuated, forskolin-stimulated PG production. (-)-N6-(R-Phenylisopropyl)adenosine and cilostamide had no effect on the mechanical actions of chlorophenylthio-cAMP, suggesting selectivity of these agents for adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase, respectively. 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha output elicited by forskolin was abolished by reduction of calcium in the perfusion fluid as well as by the calcium channel blocker diltiazem. The intracellular calcium antagonists TMB-8 and ryanodine also abolished forskolin-stimulated PG synthesis in rabbit heart. PG synthesis stimulated by 1,9-dideoxyforskolin was also prevented by reduced extracellular calcium, diltiazem, and ryanodine. The calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine, W-7, and calmidazolium failed to significantly alter PG production in response to forskolin. These results indicate that forskolin-stimulated PG synthesis in rabbit heart is independent of cAMP and requires calcium from both extracellular and intracellular sources.

Abstract:Naive T cells respond to antigens by differentiating into effector and regulatory lineages. Whereas the roles of T cell-intrinsic pathways have been extensively studied, how T cell lineage choices are controlled by innate immune signals remains elusive. Here we report that dendritic cell (DC)-expressed phosphatase MKP-1, a negative regulator of the MAP kinases, programmed reciprocal T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cell differentiation by modulating IL-12-STAT4 and IL-6-STAT3 axes and cytokine receptor expression at the DC-T cell interface. MKP-1 was regulated by innate recognition signals and its deficiency disrupted antimicrobial responses and promoted T cell-mediated inflammation. Moreover, MKP-1 inhibited induction of regulatory T cells by downregulating TGF-beta2 production from DCs. Our findings identify a regulatory circuit linking MKP-1 signaling in DCs, production of polarizing cytokines, and integration of DC-derived signals in responding T cells, that bridges innate and adaptive immunity to coordinate protective immunity and immunopathology.

Abstract:New anticancer drugs are needed to support cancer treatment. Cancer involves the uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells, and many anticancer drugs are agents that inhibit tumor cell growth. The antitumor cell N-myristoylated-peptide is a natural product purified from Heliothis virescens insect hemolymph with essentially no cytotoxicity against human foreskin fibroblast cells. A synthesized structure of six amino acids (Myristoyl-Cys-Ala-Val-Ala-Tyr-[3 methyl]His-OMe; M.W. 902.2 Da) was screened at 10 muM for in vitro antitumor activity against 56 human tumor cell lines by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The NCI found that 34 of the 56 tumor cell lines (representing eight major tumor types) were sensitive (> 50% growth inhibition of tumor cells) to the myristoylated-peptide. The best overall antitumor activities (>60% average growth inhibition) were seen against 17 tumor cell lines for non-small cell lung cancer, leukemia and melanoma and for eight other tumor cell lines. The NCI finds that their in vitro screen is an effective selector of compounds with in vivo antitumor activity.

Abstract:Inbred Lewis and Fisher 344 rat strains differ greatly in drug self-administration; Lewis rats operantly self-administer drugs of abuse including nicotine, whereas Fisher self-administer poorly. As shown herein, operant food self-administration is similar. On the basis of their pivotal role in drug reward, we hypothesized that differences in basal gene expression in GABAergic neurons projecting from nucleus accumbens (NAcc) to ventral pallidum (VP) play a role in vulnerability to drug-taking behavior. The transcriptomes of NAcc shell-VP GABAergic neurons from these two strains were analyzed in adolescents, using a multidisciplinary approach that combined stereotaxic ionotophoretic brain microinjections, laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and microarray measurement of transcripts. Laser-capture microdissection enriched the gene transcripts detected in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons compared to the residual NAcc tissue: a ratio of neuron/residual >1 and false discovery rate (FDR) <5% yielded 6623 transcripts, whereas a ratio of >3 yielded 3514. Strain-dependent differences in gene expression within GABA neurons were identified; 322 vs. 60 transcripts showed 1.5-fold vs. 2-fold differences in expression (FDR < 5%). Classification by gene ontology showed that these 322 transcripts were widely distributed, without categorical enrichment. This is most consistent with a global change in GABA neuron function. Literature mining by Chilibot found 38 genes related to synaptic plasticity, signaling and gene transcription, all of which determine drug abuse; 33 genes have no known association with addiction or nicotine. In Lewis rats, upregulation of Mint-1, Cask, CamkII , Ncam1, Vsnl1, Hpcal1 and Car8 indicates that these transcripts likely contribute to altered signaling and synaptic function in NAcc GABA projection neurons to VP.

Title:Listeners invest in an assumed other's perspective despite cognitive cost.
Authors:['Duran ND', 'Dale R', 'Kreuz RJ']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. nduran@memphis.edu
Abstract:We explored perspective-taking behavior in a visuospatial mental rotation task that requires listeners to adopt an egocentric or "other-centric" frame of reference. In the current task, objects could be interpreted relative to the point-of-view of the listener (egocentric) or of a simulated partner (other-centric). Across three studies, we evaluated participants' willingness to consider and act on partner-specific information, showing that a partner's perceived ability to contribute to collaborative mutual understanding modulated participants' perspective-taking behavior, either by increasing other-centric (Study 2) or egocentric (Study 3) responding. Moreover, we show that a large proportion of participants resolved referential ambiguity in terms of their partner's perspective, even when it was more cognitively difficult to do so (as tracked by online movement measures), and when the presence of a social partner had to be assumed (Studies 1 and 2). In addition, participants continued to consider their partner's perspective during trials where visual perspectives were shared. Our results show that participants will thoroughly invest in either an other-centric or egocentric mode of responding, and that perspective-taking strategies are not always dictated by minimizing processing demands, but by more potent (albeit subtle) factors in the social context.

Abstract:We previously reported the discovery of 2-aryl-4-benzoyl-imidazoles (ABI-I) as potent antiproliferative agents for melanoma. To further understand the structural requirements for the potency of ABI analogs, gain insight in the structure-activity relationships (SAR), and investigate metabolic stability for these compounds, we report extensive SAR studies on the ABI-I scaffold. Compared with the previous set of ABI-I analogs, the newly synthesized ABI-II analogs have lower potency in general, but some of the new analogs have comparable potency to the most active compounds in the previous set when tested in two melanoma and four prostate cancer cell lines. These SAR studies indicated that the antiproliferative activity was very sensitive to subtle changes in the ligand. Tested compounds 3ab and 8a are equally active against highly paclitaxel resistant cancer cell lines and their parental cell lines, indicating that drugs developed based on ABI-I analogs may have therapeutic advantages over paclitaxel in treating resistant tumors. Metabolic stability studies of compound 3ab revealed that N-methyl imidazole failed to extend stability as literature reported because de-methylation was found as the major metabolic pathway in rat and mouse liver microsomes. However, this sheds light on the possibility for many modifications on imidazole ring for further lead optimization since the modification on imidazole, such as compound 3ab, did not impact the potency.

Abstract:The photosubstitution reactions of molybdenum hexacarbonyl with sigma and pi donor ligands were investigated using photoacoustic calorimetry and computational methods in a series of linear alkane solvents (pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, decane, and dodecane). The results show that reaction volumes make a significant contribution to the photoacoustic signal and must be considered during thermodynamic calculations based on photoacoustic measurements. The enthalpies of CO substitution by an alkane solvent and subsequent substitution by each Lewis base were determined. Corresponding Mo-L bond energies (kcal mol(-1)) were calculated: L = linear alkanes (13), triethylsilane (26), 1-hexyne (27), 1-hexene (27), and benzene (17). The relative energies are in agreement with computational results. The experimental reaction volume for CO substitution by alkane was positive (15 mL mol(-1)) and negative or close to zero for alkane substitution by a Lewis base (for example, -11 mL mol(-1) for triethylsilane and 3.6 mL mol(-1) for benzene). The errors in the experimental and computational reaction volumes are large and often comparable to the reaction volumes. An improved calibration of the methods as well as a better understanding of the underlying physics involved is needed. For the Lewis bases reported in this study, the second-order rate constants for the displacement of a coordinated alkane are less than diffusion control (5 x 10(6)-4 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1)) and decrease monotonically with the alkane chain length. The rate constants correlate better with steric effects than with bond energies. An interchange mechanism is consistent with the results.

Abstract:It is imperative that nursing responds to the call of creating a health literate society by taking an active role in health literacy research, education, and promotion. Nurses have a professional and ethical obligation to communicate in a clear, purposeful way that addresses the unique information needs of each patient. Evidence-based strategies that promote health literacy must be incorporated in every patient's plan of care and become part of the routine practice of nursing. The goal of all patient interactions should be to empower the patient to obtain, understand, and act on information that is needed for optimal health. This article explores the concept of health literacy and its relationship to patient education and communication. Practical strategies that the nurse can use to assess, communicate with, and evaluate comprehension in patients with low literacy skills are provided.

Title:Social interaction promotes nicotine self-administration with olfactogustatory cues in adolescent rats.

Abstract:Cigarette smoking is a social behavior. Smoking is also accompanied by distinctive gustatory and olfactory stimulation. However, none of these factors affecting nicotine intake are modeled in existing preclinical studies. We report a novel model of adolescent nicotine self-administration (SA) in rats where licking on drinking spouts was used as the operant behavior to activate the concurrent delivery of nicotine (i.v.) and an appetitive olfactogustatory (OG) cue, and social interaction was required for stable SA. The operant chamber was divided by a panel that separated the SA rat and another rat serving as the demonstrator, who had free access to the OG cue but did not receive nicotine. Orofacial contacts were permitted by the divider. Conditioned taste aversion prevented solo rats to self-administer nicotine. However, stable nicotine (15-30 mug/kg, free base) SA was established in the presence of demonstrator rats with free access to the OG cue. Omitting the olfactory component of the cue prevented the acquisition of nicotine SA. Mecamylamine, a nicotinic antagonist, reduced licking behavior. Familiar peers were more effective demonstrators in facilitating the acquisition of nicotine SA than were unfamiliar rats. No sex difference in nicotine intake was found. These data indicate that the contingent OG cue is associated with the aversive property of nicotine that prevents subsequent drug intake. Social information encoded in olfaction not only permits the establishment of stable nicotine SA but also enhances nicotine intake. These findings implicate adolescent social interactions in promoting smoking behavior by surmounting the aversive property of nicotine.

Abstract:In this methods article, we describe collection and storage of clinically acquired blood and adipose samples for transcript analysis in an ongoing study exploring obesity in renal transplant recipients. Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated from whole blood using the LeukoLOCK Total RNA Isolation System (n = 4), and comparisons between fresh and frozen samples were made. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose samples (n = 4) were obtained during kidney transplantation, flash frozen, and stored at -80 degrees C. Adipose RNA was extracted using either the STAT-60 method modified for lipids or Trizol plus RNeasy extraction. Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 arrays and Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays were used for both blood and adipose transcriptome analysis. Purity, quality, and quantity of RNA were high with comparable results using both array platforms.

Title:A study of recorded versus live voice word recognition.
Authors:['Mendel LL', 'Owen SR']
Affiliation:The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. lmendel@memphis.edu
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To determine administration times for word recognition presented via monitored live voice (MLV) and compact disc (CD) recordings. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design was used. Fifty-word NU-6 lists were presented in three conditions: (1) MLV, (2) short ISI CD recording, and (3) long ISI CD recording. STUDY SAMPLE: Listeners with normal hearing (NH) and hearing impairment (HI) participated in this study. RESULTS: Average administration time using MLV was significantly shorter than using recorded word lists for both groups of listeners. MLV presentation to the NH listeners was significantly faster than the MLV presentation to the HI listeners. There were no significant differences between groups in the administration times for any of the recorded lists (long or short ISI). Considerably more variability in administration time was observed for MLV presentation compared to recorded presentations. CONCLUSIONS: MLV presentation was about one minute faster than the shortest CD recording of the NU-6 fifty-item word lists, but it was only 49 seconds quicker when administering tests to individuals with hearing loss. Because the majority of our patients are hearing impaired, the difference of 49 seconds is not clinically significant. This difference is even less when 25-item word lists are used.

Abstract:In physiological studies of free-living species, it is essential to consider the context of the life history stage at which an individual was observed in order to link measures of physiology with ecological parameters. One such measure that is important to consider is the age of an individual. We tested whether baseline or stress-induced corticosterone levels vary with age in free-living Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) during the pre-breeding period. Corticosterone (CORT), the primary avian stress hormone, is released in response to stressful stimuli, and stimulates gluconeogenesis; however, it also serves as a chemical messenger that can influence other physiological processes, reproduction, and behavior. We monitored both baseline CORT levels longitudinally throughout a five-year period and stress-induced CORT responses over a shorter two-year period. We predicted that older jays would have lower baseline CORT levels and a dampened stress response compared to younger birds, as has been shown in other avian species. We found no significant differences in baseline CORT levels with age. We found a decrease in total corticosterone responses to a stressor with age, however, the oldest birds in the population showed greater total corticosterone responses to a stressor. These results may be a product of age-related changes in physiological processes related to the stress response or a result of selection acting on the population, resulting in only the most responsive individuals surviving to old age.

Abstract:Chloracne is commonly observed in people exposed to dioxins, yet the mechanism of toxicity is not well understood. The pathology of chloracne is characterized by hyperkeratinization of the interfollicular squamous epithelium, hyperproliferation and hyperkeratinization of hair follicle cells as well as a metaplastic response of the ductular sebum secreting sebaceous glands. In vitro studies using normal human epidermal keratinocytes to model interfollicular human epidermis demonstrate a 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-mediated acceleration of differentiation and increase in gene expression of several prodifferentiation genes, including filaggrin (FLG). Here, we demonstrated that the TCDD-activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) bound a small fragment of DNA upstream of the transcriptional start sites of the FLG gene, containing one of two candidate xenobiotic response elements (XREs). Reporter assays using the promoter region of FLG containing the two putative XREs indicated that the increase in this messenger RNA (mRNA) was due to TCDD-mediated enhanced transcription, which was lost when both XREs were mutated. As FLG is part of the human epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) found on chromosome 1, we measured mRNAs from an additional 18 EDC genes for their regulation by TCDD. Of these genes, 14 were increased by TCDD. Immunoblot assays demonstrated that the proteins of FLG as well as that of another prodifferentiation gene, small proline rich protein 2, were increased by TCDD. In utero exposure to TCDD accelerated the formation of the epidermal barrier in the developing mouse fetus by approximately 1 day. These results indicate that the epidermal permeability barrier is a functional target of the TCDD-activated AHR.

Abstract:This study investigated the replicability of a previously proposed personality typology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, and explored stability of cluster membership over a 6-month period. Participants with current PTSD (n = 156) were drawn from the Collaborative Longitudinal Personality Disorders Study (CLPS). The CLPS project tracked a large sample of individuals who met criteria for 1 of 4 target diagnoses (borderline, schizotypal, avoidant, and obsessive-compulsive) and a contrast group of individuals who met criteria for depression but no personality disorder. A cluster analysis using scales from the Schedule of Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality yielded 3 clusters: "internalizing," "externalizing," and "low pathology." Using K-means cluster analysis, the results did not replicate previous work. Using Ward's method, the hypothesized 3-cluster structure was confirmed at baseline but did not demonstrate temporal stability at 6 months.

Title:Fuzzy tree automata and syntactic pattern recognition.
Authors:['Lee ET']
Affiliation:Department of Mathematical Sciences, Memphis State University, Memphis, TN 38152.
Abstract:An approach of representing patterns by trees and processing these trees by fuzzy tree automata is described. Fuzzy tree automata are defined and investigated. The results include that the class of fuzzy root-to-frontier recognizable inverted question mark-trees is closed under intersection, union, and complementation. Thus, the class of fuzzy root-to-frontier recognizable inverted question mark-trees forms a Boolean algebra. Fuzzy tree automata are applied to processing fuzzy tree representation of patterns based on syntactic pattern recognition. The grade of acceptance is defined and investigated. Quantitative measures of ``approximate isosceles triangle,'' ``approximate elongated isosceles triangle,'' ``approximate rectangle,'' and ``approximate cross'' are defined and used in the illustrative examples of this approach. By using these quantitative measures, a house, a house with high roof, and a church are also presented as illustrative examples. In addition, three fuzzy tree automata are constructed which have the capability of processing the fuzzy tree representations of ``fuzzy houses,'' ``houses with high roofs,'' and ``fuzzy churches,'' respectively. The results may have useful applications in pattern recognition, image processing, artificial intelligence, pattern database design and processing, image science, and pictorial information systems.

Title:What do we know about mechanical strain in lung alveoli?
Authors:['Roan E', 'Waters CM']
Affiliation:Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38163-0001, USA.
Abstract:The pulmonary alveolus, terminal gas-exchange unit of the lung, is composed of alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells separated by a thin basement membrane and interstitial space. These cells participate in the maintenance of a delicate system regulated not only by biological factors but also by the mechanical environment of the lung, which undergoes dynamic deformation during breathing. Clinical and animal studies as well as cell culture studies point toward a strong influence of mechanical forces on lung cells and tissues including effects on growth and repair, surfactant release, injury, and inflammation. However, despite substantial advances in our understanding of lung mechanics over the last half century, there are still many unanswered questions regarding the micromechanics of the alveolus and how it deforms during lung inflation. Therefore, the aims of this review are to draw a multidisciplinary account of the mechanics of the alveolus on the basis of its structure, biology, and chemistry and to compare estimates of alveolar deformation from previous studies.

Abstract:The cellular heterogeneity of brain poses a particularly thorny issue in genome-wide gene expression studies. Because laser capture microdissection (LCM) enables the precise extraction of a small area of tissue, we combined LCM with neuronal track tracing to collect nucleus accumbens shell neurons that project to ventral pallidum, which are of particular interest in the study of reward and addiction. Four independent biological samples of accumbens projection neurons were obtained. Approximately 500 pg of total RNA from each sample was then amplified linearly and subjected to Affymetrix microarray and Applied Biosystems sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and detection (SOLiD) transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq). A total of 375 million 50-bp reads were obtained from RNA-seq. Approximately 57% of these reads were mapped to the rat reference genome (Baylor 3.4/rn4). Approximately 11,000 unique RefSeq genes and 100,000 unique exons were identified from each sample. Of the unmapped reads, the quality scores were 4.74 +/- 0.42 lower than the mapped reads. When RNA-seq and microarray data from the same samples were compared, Pearson correlations were between 0.764 and 0.798. The variances in data obtained for the four samples by microarray and RNA-seq were similar for medium to high abundance genes, but less among low abundance genes detected by microarray. Analysis of 34 genes by real-time polymerase chain reaction showed higher correlation with RNA-seq (0.66) than with microarray (0.46). Further analysis showed 20-30 million 50-bp reads are sufficient to provide estimates of gene expression levels comparable to those produced by microarray. In summary, this study showed that picogram quantities of total RNA obtained by LCM of approximately 700 individual neurons is sufficient to take advantage of the benefits provided by the transcriptome sequencing technology, such as low background noise, high dynamic range, and high precision.

Title:Electrochemical quantification of 2,6-diisopropylphenol (propofol).

Abstract:2,6-Diisopropylphenol (propofol) is a potent anesthetic drug with fast onset of the anesthetic effect and short recovery time for the patients. Outside of the United States, propofol is widely used in performing target controlled infusion anesthesia. With the long term vision of an electrochemical sensor for in vivo monitoring and feedback controlled dosing of propofol in blood, different alternatives for the electrochemical quantification of propofol using diverse working electrodes and experimental conditions are presented in this contribution. When the electrochemical oxidation of propofol takes place on a glassy carbon working electrode, an electrochemically active film grows on the electrode surface. The reduction current of the film is proportional to the propofol concentration and the accumulation time. Based on these findings a stripping analytical method was developed for the detection of propofol in acidic solutions between 0 and 30 muM, with a detection limit of 5.5+/-0.4 muM. By restricting the scanned potential window between 0.5 V and 1.0 V in cyclic voltammetric experiments, the formation of the electrochemically active polymer can be prevented. This allowed the development of a direct voltammetric method for assessing propofol in acidic solutions between 0 and 30 muM, with a 3.2+/-0.1 muM (n=3) detection limit. The stripping method has a better sensitivity but somewhat worse reproducibility because the electrode surface has to be renewed between each experiment. The direct method does not require the renewal of the electrode surface between measurements but has no adequate selectivity towards the common interfering compounds.

Title:The legacy of fear: is fear impacting fatal and non-fatal drowning of African American children?
Authors:['Irwin CC', 'Irwin RL', 'Ryan TD', 'Drayer J']
Affiliation:University of Memphis.
Abstract:African American children's rates for fatal and non-fatal drowning events are alarmingly elevated, with some age groups having three times the rate as compared to White peers. Adequate swimming skills are considered a protective agent toward the prevention of drowning, but marginalized youth report limited swimming ability. This research examined minority children's and parents/caregivers' fear of drowning as a possible variable associated with limited swimming ability. Results confirmed that there were significant racial differences concerning the fear of drowning, and adolescent African American females were notably more likely to fear drowning while swimming than any other group. The "fear of drowning" responses by parents/ caregivers of minority children were also significantly different from their White counterparts.

Title:Effects of 2-nitrooxy ethyl 2-amino 3-methylbutanoate gel on resistance exercise performance and blood nitrate/nitrite in resistance trained men.

Abstract:Nitric oxide dietary supplements are popular within the sport community. Our recent work involving the oral intake of 2-nitrooxy ethyl 2-amino 3-methylbutanoate demonstrated an approximately 6.7% increase in circulating nitrate/nitrite. However, no measures of exercise performance were obtained. The present study used a topical form of this molecule to determine the impact on exercise performance and blood nitrate/nitrite. Fourteen resistance trained men (24 +/- 1 years old) reported to the laboratory on 2 occasions to undergo exercise testing, which consisted of arm curl isometric force and muscular endurance (3 sets to fatigue using 80, 65, and 50% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]: total of 9 sets). The gel (2-nitrooxy ethyl 2-amino 3-methylbutanoate; mixed in tea tree oil) or placebo (tea tree oil) was applied topically by the subjects for 7 days before each test day, with 7-10 days separating the randomly ordered conditions. Blood samples, arm circumference, and perceived "muscle pump" were taken before and immediately after exercise on both test days. The heart rate and perceived exertion were measured after each set. No statistically significant differences were noted between conditions for performance variables (p > 0.05). However, when using a load of 50% of 1RM, 6.2% more repetitions were performed when using the gel as compared with when using the placebo; 19.9% more repetitions were performed by 8 subjects noted to be "responders" to gel treatment. Blood lactate and muscle pump significantly increased with exercise (p < 0.0001) but were not different between conditions (p > 0.05). Minimal change was noted in nitrate/nitrite, and the heart rate and perceived exertion were nearly identical between conditions (p > 0.05). These findings indicate that 2-nitrooxy ethyl 2-amino 3-methylbutanoate gel has a modest (6.2%), nonstatistically significant effect on exercise performance, in particular when using a load of 50% 1RM-with greater benefit noted in selected individuals. Studies inclusive of a larger sample size are needed to extend these initial findings.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study is to describe the development, implementation, and success of recruitment and adherence strategies of 303 African American preadolescent girls and their primary caregiver in the Girls health Enrichment Multi-site Studies (GEMS) program. METHODS: A socio-ecologic model was used to guide selection and implementation of recruitment and retention strategies which were continuously monitored and revised in response. Strategy mode and frequency associated with program enrollment, engagement, and retention were analyzed. RESULTS: Successful recruitment approaches included radio messages (23.1%), school fliers (20.1%), and friend referral (15%). Initially 463 potential participants responded, 320 girls were screened, and 303 enrolled. Significant increases in participant accrual were observed between Wave 4 (n=28) and Wave 5 (n=91) after using a team recruitment approach. Implementing case management strategies and providing make-up sessions also served to keep participants current and engaged in the program. In year 2, community field trips replaced the more structured sessions providing participants with experiential learning opportunities. Overall intervention attendance rates ranged from 79.7% to 90.5% among waves. Further, 75.9% and 80.2%, respectively, of participants attended 1-year and 2-year follow-ups. CONCLUSION: Multiple recruitment strategies and flexible, responsive approaches to recruitment and retention guided by the socio-ecologic model facilitated optimal implementation of an intervention for preadolescent girls. Through the application of the socio-ecologic model researchers and program leaders will be able to identify strategies to enhance the probability of successful outcomes.

Title:The developing zebrafish (Danio rerio): a vertebrate model for high-throughput screening of chemical libraries.
Authors:['Lessman CA']
Affiliation:Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. Clessman@memphis.edu
Abstract:The zebrafish, Danio rerio, a small, tropical freshwater species native to Pakistan and India, has become a National Institutes of Health-sanctioned model organism and, due to its many advantages as an experimental vertebrate, it has garnered intense interest from the world's scientific community. Some have labeled the zebrafish, the "vertebrate Drosophila," due to its genetic tractability, small size, low cost, and rapid development. The transparency of the embryo, external development, and the many hundreds of mutant and transgenic lines available add to the allure. Now it appears, the zebrafish can be used for high-throughput screening (HTS) of drug libraries in the discovery process of promising new therapeutics. In this review, various types of screening methods are briefly outlined, as are a variety of screens for different disease models, to highlight the range of zebrafish HTS possibilities. High-content screening (HCS) has been available for cell-based screens for some time and, very recently, HCS is being adapted for the zebrafish. This will allow analysis, at high resolution, of drug effects on whole vertebrates; thus, whole body effects as well as those on specific organs and tissues may be determined.

Title:Can differences in host behavior drive patterns of disease prevalence in tadpoles?
Authors:['Venesky MD', 'Kerby JL', 'Storfer A', 'Parris MJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biological Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America. mvenesky@usf.edu
Abstract:Differences in host behavior and resistance to disease can influence the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. We capitalized on the variation in aggregation behavior of Fowler's toads (Anaxyrus [ = Bufo] fowleri) and grey treefrogs (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles and tested for differences in transmission of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and host-specific fitness consequences (i.e., life history traits that imply fitness) of infection in single-species amphibian mesocosms. On average, A. fowleri mesocosms supported higher Bd prevalences and infection intensities relative to H. versicolor mesocosms. Higher Bd prevalence in A. fowleri mesocosms may result, in part, from higher intraspecific transmission due to the aggregation of tadpoles raised in Bd treatments. We also found that, independent of species, tadpoles raised in the presence of Bd were smaller and less developed than tadpoles raised in disease-free conditions. Our results indicate that aggregation behavior might increase Bd prevalence and that A. fowleri tadpoles carry heavier infections relative to H. versicolor tadpoles. However, our results demonstrate that Bd appears to negatively impact larval growth and developmental rates of A. fowleri and H. versicolor similarly, even in the absence of high Bd prevalence.

Abstract:The association between periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH) and frequent handling resulting from various neonatal intensive care procedures and routine interventions was evaluated in a prospective clinical study. Inborn premature babies with birth weight less than or equal to 1500 gm (n = 156) who did not have PV-IVH or who had grade 1 PV-IVH at less than or equal to 1 hour were randomly assigned to the reduced manipulation protocol (n = 62) or to standard care (n = 94). A bedside microcomputer-based data acquisition system was used to monitor the duration of rest or the number of interventions per day. Infants assigned to receive reduced manipulation spent a significantly higher percentage of time each day at rest than did those who received standard manipulation (p less than 0.006). However, the incidence of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH did not differ significantly (30% in the study vs 37% in the standard manipulation group). When we analyzed the effect of manipulation in relation to risk of PV-IVH, while taking into account other perinatal variables, standard manipulation was not associated with increased risk of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH. However, low birth weight, maternal smoking, general anesthesia, early grade 1 PV-IVH, low hematocrit, lowest arterial oxygen pressure within the first 6 hours of life, and large base deficit at 6 hours of age all increased the relative risk of grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH.

Title:Ligand-based autotaxin pharmacophore models reflect structure-based docking results.
Authors:['Mize CD', 'Abbott AM', 'Gacasan SB', 'Parrill AL', 'Baker DL']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The autotaxin (ATX) enzyme exhibits lysophospholipase D activity responsible for the conversion of lysophosphatidyl choline to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). ATX and LPA have been linked to the initiation of atherosclerosis, cancer invasiveness, and neuropathic pain. ATX inhibition therefore offers currently unexploited therapeutic potential, and substantial interest in the development of ATX inhibitors is evident in the recent literature. Here we report the performance-based comparison of ligand-based pharmacophores developed on the basis of different combinations of ATX inhibitors in the training sets against an extensive database of compounds tested for ATX inhibitory activity, as well as with docking results of the actives against a recently reported ATX crystal structure. In general, pharmacophore models show better ability to select active ATX inhibitors binding in a common location when the ligand-based superposition shows a good match to the superposition of actives based on docking results. Two pharmacophore models developed on the basis of competitive inhibitors in combination with the single inhibitor crystallized to date in the active site of ATX were able to identify actives at rates over 40%, a substantial improvement over the <10% representation of active site-directed actives in the test set database.

Title:Impact of caloric and dietary restriction regimens on markers of health and longevity in humans and animals: a summary of available findings.
Authors:['Trepanowski JF', 'Canale RE', 'Marshall KE', 'Kabir MM', 'Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Considerable interest has been shown in the ability of caloric restriction (CR) to improve multiple parameters of health and to extend lifespan. CR is the reduction of caloric intake - typically by 20 - 40% of ad libitum consumption - while maintaining adequate nutrient intake. Several alternatives to CR exist. CR combined with exercise (CE) consists of both decreased caloric intake and increased caloric expenditure. Alternate-day fasting (ADF) consists of two interchanging days; one day, subjects may consume food ad libitum (sometimes equaling twice the normal intake); on the other day, food is reduced or withheld altogether. Dietary restriction (DR) - restriction of one or more components of intake (typically macronutrients) with minimal to no reduction in total caloric intake - is another alternative to CR. Many religions incorporate one or more forms of food restriction. The following religious fasting periods are featured in this review: 1) Islamic Ramadan; 2) the three principal fasting periods of Greek Orthodox Christianity (Nativity, Lent, and the Assumption); and 3) the Biblical-based Daniel Fast. This review provides a summary of the current state of knowledge related to CR and DR. A specific section is provided that illustrates related work pertaining to religious forms of food restriction. Where available, studies involving both humans and animals are presented. The review includes suggestions for future research pertaining to the topics of discussion.

Title:Tonic regulation of GABAergic synaptic activity on vasopressin neurones by cannabinoids.
Authors:['Wang L', 'Armstrong WE']
Affiliation:Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology and Neuroscience Institute, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.
Abstract:Synaptic activity in magnocellular neurosecretory neurones is influenced by the retrograde (i.e. somatodendritic) release of vasopressin, oxytocin and cannabinoids (CBs). For oxytocin neurones, oxytocin exerts constitutive effects on pre-synaptic activity through its ability to release CBs post-synaptically. In the present study, we examined evoked inhibitory post-synaptic currents (eIPSCs) and spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (sIPSCs) in identified vasopressin (VP) neurones in coronal slices from virgin rats to determine: (i) the extent to which CBs may also tonically modulate VP synaptic activity; and (ii) to determine whether depolarisation-induced suppression of inhibition was present in VP neurones, and if so, whether it was mediated by VP or CBs. The CB1 antagonists AM251 (1 mum) and SR14171 (1 mum) consistently increased the frequency of sIPSCs in VP neurones without affecting their amplitude, suggesting a tonic CB presence. This effect on frequency was independent of action potential activity, and blocked by chelating intracellular calcium with 10 mm ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA). AM251 also increased the amplitude of eIPSCs and decreased the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) in VP neurones-effects that were completely blocked with even low (1 mm EGTA) internal calcium chelation. Bouts of evoked firing of VP neurones consistently suppressed sIPSCs but had no effect on eIPSCs or the PPR. This depolarisation-induced suppression of IPSCs was reduced by AM251, and was totally blocked by 10 mum of the mixed vasopressin/oxytocin antagonist, Manning compound. We then tested the effect of vasopressin on IPSCs at the same time as blocking CB1 receptors. Vasopressin (10-100 nm) inhibited sIPSC frequency but had no effect on sIPSC or eIPSC amplitudes, or on the PPR, in the presence of AM251. Taken together, these results suggest a tonic, pre-synaptic inhibitory modulation of IPSCs in VP neurones by CBs that is largely dependent on post-synaptic calcium, and an inhibitory effect of VP on IPSCs that is independent of CB release.

Authors:['Carr GF']
Affiliation:Loewenberg School of Nursing, The University of Memphis, 610 Goodman Street, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Purpose. Based on a review of the literature, this paper presents a unique and innovative model that offers an empowerment framework, which may be used to develop advocacy in African American (AA) grandmother caregivers. This proposed framework centers on education as a catalyst to the empowerment process in these grandmothers. Application of this model has potential to guide the practice of healthcare providers as they assist these caregivers in managing their own lives. Methodology. Various empowerment definitions and research were used to develop this empowerment framework. Discussion. This framework offers an empowerment education program for AA grandmothers providing care for their grandchildren on topics that they feel are necessary to appropriately care for themselves and their grandchildren. Outcomes of this empowerment education are to develop skills within these grandmothers so that they will be able to advocate for themselves, their grandchildren, and others within their communities. This education will ultimately produce skillful AA grandmothers who will develop abilities to empower themselves and other AA grandmothers who are in similar circumstances.

Title:Variability of indoor and outdoor VOC measurements: an analysis using variance components.

Affiliation:School of Public Health, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. cjia@memphis.edu
Abstract:This study examines concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured inside and outside of 162 residences in southeast Michigan, U.S.A. Nested analyses apportioned four sources of variation: city, residence, season, and measurement uncertainty. Indoor measurements were dominated by seasonal and residence effects, accounting for 50 and 31%, respectively, of the total variance. Contributions from measurement uncertainty (<20%) and city effects (<10%) were small. For outdoor measurements, season, city and measurement variation accounted for 43, 29 and 27% of variance, respectively, while residence location had negligible impact (<2%). These results show that, to obtain representative estimates of indoor concentrations, measurements in multiple seasons are required. In contrast, outdoor VOC concentrations can use multi-seasonal measurements at centralized locations. Error models showed that uncertainties at low concentrations might obscure effects of other factors. Variance component analyses can be used to interpret existing measurements, design effective exposure studies, and determine whether the instrumentation and protocols are satisfactory.

Abstract:The synthesis, characterization, and water oxidation activity of mononuclear ruthenium complexes with tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPA), tris(6-methyl-2-pyridylmethyl)amine (Me(3)TPA), and a new pentadentate ligand N,N-bis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-2,2'-bipyridine-6-methanamine (DPA-Bpy) have been described. The electrochemical properties of these mononuclear Ru complexes have been investigated by both experimental and computational methods. Using Ce(IV) as oxidant, stoichiometric oxidation of water by [Ru(TPA)(H(2)O)(2)](2+) was observed, while Ru(Me(3)TPA)(H(2)O)(2)](2+) has much less activity for water oxidation. Compared to [Ru(TPA)(H(2)O)(2)](2+) and [Ru(Me(3)TPA)(H(2)O)(2)](2+), [Ru(DPA-Bpy)(H(2)O)](2+) exhibited 20 times higher activity for water oxidation. This study demonstrates a new type of ligand scaffold to support water oxidation by mononuclear Ru complexes.

Title:Psychotherapy for the treatment of depression: a comprehensive review of controlled outcome research.
Authors:['Robinson LA', 'Berman JS', 'Neimeyer RA']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:Previous quantitative reviews of research on the efficacy of psychotherapy for depression have included only a subset of the available research or limited their focus to a single outcome measure. The present review offers a more comprehensive quantitative integration of this literature. Using studies that compared psychotherapy with either no treatment or another form of treatment, this article assesses (a) the overall effectiveness of psychotherapy for depressed clients, (b) its effectiveness relative to pharmacotherapy, and (c) the clinical significance of treatment outcomes. Findings from the review confirm that depressed clients benefit substantially from psychotherapy, and these gains appear comparable to those observed with pharmacotherapy. Initial analysis suggested some differences in the efficacy of various types of treatment; however, once the influence of investigator allegiance was removed, there remained no evidence for the relative superiority of any 1 approach. In view of these results, the focus of future research should be less on differentiating among psychotherapies for depression than on identifying the factors responsible for improvement.

To our knowledge, no data are available concerning the effects of oral geranamine intake on heart rate (HR) and blood pressure in individuals. METHODS: Ten young healthy men and women ingested 1 of 5 conditions on different days using a double-blind, randomized, crossover design. The following were ingested after a 10-hour overnight fast: 250 mg caffeine (C), 50 mg geranamine (G 50 mg), 75 mg geranamine (G 75 mg), 250 mg caffeine + 50 mg geranamine (C + G 50 mg), and 250 mg caffeine + 75 mg geranamine (C + G 75 mg). Heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and rate pressure product (RPP) were measured pre-ingestion and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-ingestion. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) were measured pre-ingestion and at 60 and 120 minutes post-ingestion. RESULTS: Heart rate was unaffected by treatment, but blood pressure and RPP were higher with geranamine, generally in a dose-dependent manner. The peak percent change from pre-ingestion in SBP (~20%), DBP (~17%), and RPP (~9%) was noted with C + G 75 mg at 60 minutes post-ingestion. Plasma NE and EPI were relatively unaffected by treatment. CONCLUSION: We report for the first time that acute ingestion of 1,3-dimethylamylamine alone and in combination with caffeine results in an increase in SBP, DBP, and RPP without an increase in HR. The largest increase is observed at 60 minutes post-ingestion of C + G 75 mg. These changes cannot be explained by circulating NE and EPI.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Assessment of patient function after TKA often focuses on implant alignment and daily activity capabilities, but the functional results and kinematics of the TKA are not easily predicted by some of these parameters during surgery. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether differences in implant alignment in the transverse plane may affect fluorokinematics and be one of the many variables that help explain the discrepancies in fluorokinematic results. METHODS: We utilized a computer model (LifeMOD/KneeSIM; LifeModeler, Inc, San Clemente, CA, USA) to show variability in polyethylene contact patterns. We imported components of a cruciate-retaining TKA into the model and subjected the systems to a simulated lunge. We modeled five different combinations of implant positioning in the transverse plane of both the femoral and tibial components in internal or external rotation and compared the resulting changes in joint rotations and displacements of these five variations to those for published fluorokinematic observations using the same modeled lunge-type maneuver for five patients. RESULTS: We observed variations in AP translation of the lateral and medial femoral condyles resembling several of those in the literature for individual patients with the same cruciate-retaining knee implant. The largest AP translational changes were seen with the tibia internally rotated 5 degrees . Using the five different implant transverse plane alignment scenarios resulted in a coefficient of determination of 0.6 for the linear regression when compared to five subjects from a published fluorokinematic study. CONCLUSIONS: Variations in implant positioning may be responsible for variations in fluorokinematics reported for individual subjects with the same implant design.

Abstract:This study explored the association of shame and guilt with PTSD among women who had experienced intimate partner violence (IPV). Sixty-three women were assessed by a research clinic serving the mental health needs of women IPV survivors. Results indicated that shame, guilt-related distress, and guilt-related cognitions showed significant associations with PTSD but global guilt did not. When shame and guilt were examined in the context of specific forms of psychological abuse, moderation analyses indicated that high levels of both emotional/verbal abuse and dominance/isolation interacted with high levels of shame in their association with PTSD. Neither guilt-related distress nor guilt-related cognitions were moderated by specific forms of psychological abuse in their association with PTSD. These data support the conceptualization of shame, guilt distress, and guilt cognitions as relevant features of PTSD. Results are discussed in light of proposed changes to diagnostic criteria for PTSD.

Abstract:The immune system is a necessary, but potentially costly, defense against infectious diseases. When nutrition is limited, immune activity may consume a significant amount of an organism's energy budget. Levels of dietary protein affect immune system function; high levels can enhance disease resistance. We exposed southern leopard frog [Lithobates sphenocephalus (=Rana sphenocephala)] tadpoles to high and low protein diets crossed with the presence or absence of the pathogenic amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Bd) and quantified: (1) tadpole resistance to Bd; (2) tadpole skin-swelling in response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) injection (a measure of the T cell-mediated response of the immune system); (3) bacterial killing ability (BKA) of tadpole blood (a measure of the complement-mediated cytotoxicity of the innate immune system); and (4) tadpole growth and development. Tadpoles raised on a low-protein diet were smaller and less developed than tadpoles on a high-protein diet. When controlled for developmental stage, tadpoles raised on a low-protein diet had reduced PHA and BKA responses relative to tadpoles on a high-protein diet, but these immune responses were independent of Bd exposure. High dietary protein significantly increased resistance to Bd. Our results support the general hypothesis that host condition can strongly affect disease resistance; in particular, fluctuations in dietary protein availability may change how diseases affect populations in the field.

Title:In vitro differentiation and biocompatibility of mesenchymal stem cells on a novel platelet releasate-containing injectable composite.

Abstract:Underlying changes in subchondral and cancellous bone precede joint degeneration in spinal discs, knees, hips, and other joints. We hypothesize that an early bone remodeling intervention therapy may alleviate or postpone the later manifestation of joint failure. Utilization of a novel biomaterial for injection deliverability to the underlying subchondral and cancellous bone during the onset of osseous changes, before severe cartilaginous damage, is proposed. In this preliminary study, we introduced novel platelet releasate-containing alginate/calcium phosphate composites for this intervention therapy and evaluated them in vitro through mesenchymal stem cell biocompatibility and induction of osteochondral differentiation. DNA quantification and gene expression profiles suggested mesenchymal stem cells were directed along an osteochondral differentiation pathway, more specifically, to the immature nonhypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype. These conclusions were based on reduced mitogenic activity, a rapid upregulation followed by suppression of Runx2 transcription factor mRNA, sustained upregulation of Sox9 transcription factor mRNA and the absence of late marker expressions for both mature articular chondrocytes and osteoblasts over the course of 14 days. Initial findings in regard to the use of these materials for bone remodeling were positive and support the execution of future studies evaluating the inflammatory and angiogenic aspects of the materials. In this study, we have considered one of the many aspects of the endochondral ossification process; neovascularization and resorption of bone with an irregular physiology need to be evaluated.

Title:Work engagement in nursing: a concept analysis.
Authors:['Bargagliotti LA']
Affiliation:University of Memphis Loewenberg School of Nursing, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. tbargagl@memphis.edu
Abstract:AIM: This article is a report of an analysis of the concept of work engagement. Background. Work engagement is the central issue for 21st century professionals and specifically for registered nurses. Conceptual clarity about work engagement gives empirical direction for future research and a theoretical underpinning for the myriad studies about nurses and their work environment. METHOD: Walker and Avant's method of concept analysis was used. Nursing, business, psychology and health sciences databases were searched using Science Direct, CINAHL, OVID, Academic One File, ABI INFORM and PsycINFO for publications that were: written in English, published between 1990 and 2010, and described or studied work engagement in any setting with any population. RESULTS: Work engagement is a positive, fulfilling state of mind about work that is characterized by vigour, dedication and absorption. Trust (organizationally, managerially and collegially) and autonomy are the antecedents of work engagement. The outcomes of nurses' work engagement are higher levels of personal initiative that are contagious, decreased hospital mortality rates and significantly higher financial profitability of organizations. CONCLUSION: When work engagement is conceptually removed from a transactional job demands-resources model, the relational antecedents of trust and autonomy have greater explanatory power for work engagement in nurses. Untangling the antecedents, attributes and outcomes of work engagement is important to future research efforts.

Abstract:This mixed-method study investigated perceptions women domestic violence survivors/victims have about why women do not seek help from formal support structures and actions domestic helping agencies can take to facilitate survivor access to services. Congruent with previous research, quantitative analysis identified 17 reasons women do not seek help from formal support structures. Expanding current knowledge, concept mapping revealed six ways family violence programs can better reach women in abusive relationships, including (1) remove barriers to services, (2) improve comfort with services, (3) "talk about it," (4) improve community awareness, (5) victim-targeted marketing, and (6) "I honestly don't know."

Title:An innovative multi-component variate that reveals hierarchy and evolution of structural damage in a solid: application to acrylic bone cement.
Authors:['Qi G', 'Fan M', 'Lewis G', 'Wayne SF']

Abstract:A major limitation of solid mechanics is the inability to take into account the influence of hierarchy and evolution of the inherent microscopic structure on evaluating the performance of materials. Irreversible damage and fracture in solids, studied commonly as cracks, flaws, and conventional material properties, are by no means descriptive of the subsequent responses of the microstructures to the applied load. In this work, we addressed this limitation through the use of a novel multi-component variate. The essence of this variate is that it allows the presentation of the random damage in the amplitude spectrum, probability space, and probabilistic entropy. Its uniqueness is that it reveals the evolution and hierarchy of random damage in multi- and trans-scales, and, in addition, it includes the correlations among the various damage features. To better understand the evolution and hierarchy of random damage, we conducted a series of experiments designed to test three variants of a poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) bone cement, distinguished by the methods used to sterilize the cement powder. While analysis of results from conventional tension tests and scanning electron microscopy failed to pinpoint differences among these cement variants, our multi-component variate allowed quantification of the multi- and trans-scale random damage events that occurred in the loading process. We tested the statistical significance of damage states to differentiate the responses at the various loading stages and compared the damage states among the groups. We also interpreted the hierarchical and evolutional damage in terms of the probabilistic entropy (s), the applied stress (sigma), and the trajectory of damage state. We found that the cement powder sterilization method has a strong influence on the evolution of damage states in the cured cement specimens when subjected to stress in controlled mechanical tests. We have shown that in PMMA bone cements, our damage state variate has the unique ability to quantify and discern the history and evolution of microstructural damage.

Abstract:We describe a new co-entrapment and release motif based on the combination of noncovalent and steric interactions in materials with well-defined nanopores. Individual components enter hollow nanocapsules through nanopores in the capsule shell. Their complex, larger than the pore size, remains entrapped. The dissociation of the complex upon external stimulus releases entrapped components. Reversible formation of complexes between diaza-18-crown-6 and metal ions was used to demonstrate the feasibility of new approach to co-entrapment and triggered release.

Title:Hormonal response to lipid and carbohydrate meals during the acute postprandial period.
Authors:['Alleman RJ Jr', 'Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, Department of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA. rbloomer@memphis.edu.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Optimizing the hormonal environment during the postprandial period in favor of increased anabolism is of interest to many active individuals. Data are conflicting regarding the acute hormonal response to high fat and high carbohydrate feedings. Moreover, to our knowledge, no studies have compared the acute hormonal response to ingestion of lipid and carbohydrate meals of different size. METHODS: We compared the hormonal response to lipid and carbohydrate meals of different caloric content during the acute postprandial period. Nine healthy men (22 +/- 2 years) consumed in a random order, cross-over design one of four meals/beverages during the morning hours in a rested and fasted state: dextrose at 75 g (300 kcals), dextrose at 150 g (600 kcals), lipid at 33 g (300 kcals), lipid at 66 g (600 kcals). Blood samples were collected Pre meal, and at 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 2 hr, and 3 hr post meal. Samples were assayed for testosterone, cortisol, and insulin using ELISA techniques. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each variable, and a 4 x 5 ANOVA was used to further analyze data. RESULTS: A meal x time effect (p = 0.0003) was noted for insulin, with values highest for the dextrose meals at the 0.5 hr and 1 hr times, and relatively unaffected by the lipid meals. No interaction (p = 0.98) or meal (p = 0.39) effect was noted for testosterone, nor was an interaction (p = 0.99) or meal (p = 0.65) effect noted for cortisol. However, a time effect was noted for both testosterone (p = 0.04) and cortisol (p < 0.0001), with values decreasing during the postprandial period. An AUC effect was noted for insulin (p = 0.001), with values higher for the dextrose meals compared to the lipid meals (p < 0.05). No AUC effect was noted for testosterone (p = 0.85) or cortisol (p = 0.84). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that 1) little difference is noted in serum testosterone or cortisol during the acute postprandial period when healthy men consume lipid and dextrose meals of different size; 2) Both testosterone and cortisol experience a drop during the acute postprandial period, which is similar to what is expected based on the normal diurnal variation--feeding with lipid or dextrose meals does not appear to alter this pattern; 3) dextrose meals of either 75 g or 150 g result in a significant increase in serum insulin, in particular at 0.5 hr and 1 hr post-ingestion; 4) lipid meals have little impact on serum insulin.

Abstract:Trepanowski, JF, Farney, TM, McCarthy, CG, Schilling, BK, Craig, SA, and Bloomer, RJ. The effects of chronic betaine supplementation on exercise performance, skeletal muscle oxygen saturation, and associated biochemical parameters in resistance trained men. J Strength Cond Res 25(12): 3461-3471, 2011-We examined the effects of chronic betaine supplementation on exercise performance and associated parameters in resistance trained men. Men were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner using a crossover design to consume betaine (2.5 g of betaine mixed in 500 ml of Gatorade(R)) or a placebo (500 ml of Gatorade(R)) for 14 days, with a 21-day washout period. Before and after each treatment period, tests of lower- and upper-body muscular power and isometric force were conducted, including a test of upper-body muscular endurance (10 sets of bench press exercise to failure). Muscle tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) during the bench press protocol was measured via near infrared spectroscopy. Blood samples were collected before and after the exercise test protocol for analysis of lactate, nitrate/nitrite (NOx), and malondialdehyde (MDA). When analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance, no significant differences were noted between conditions for exercise performance variables (p > 0.05). However, an increase in total repetitions (p = 0.01) and total volume load (p = 0.02) in the 10-set bench press protocol was noted with betaine supplementation (paired t-tests), with values increasing approximately 6.5% from preintervention to postintervention. Although not of statistical significance (p = 0.14), postexercise blood lactate increased to a lesser extent with betaine supplementation (210%) compared with placebo administration (270%). NOx was lower postintervention as compared with preintervention (p = 0.06), and MDA was relatively unchanged. The decrease in StO2 during the bench press protocol was greater with betaine vs. placebo (p = 0.01), possibly suggesting enhanced muscle oxygen consumption. These findings indicate that betaine supplementation results in a moderate increase in total repetitions and volume load in the bench press exercise, without favorably impacting other performance measures.

Abstract:This is an unusual moment in the history of psychology because of landmark advances in digital information technologies, computational linguistics, and other fields that use the computer to analyze language, discourse, and behavior. The technologies developed from this interdisciplinary fusion are helping students learn and think in ways that are sensitive to their cognitive and emotional states. Recent projects have developed computer technologies that help us understand the nature of conversational discourse and text comprehension in addition to improving learning. AutoTutor and other systems with conversational agents (i.e., talking heads) help students learn by holding conversations in natural language. One version of AutoTutor is sensitive to the emotions of students in addition to their cognitive states. Coh-Metrix analyzes texts on multiple levels of language and discourse, such as text genre, cohesion, syntax, and word characteristics. Coh-Metrix can assist students, teachers, principals, and policymakers when they make decisions on the right text to assign to the right student at the right time. Computers are not perfect conversation partners and comprehenders of text, but the current systems are undeniably useful. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2011 APA, all rights reserved).

Abstract:This study assesses the social, emotional and behavioral symptoms of 2,575 youth who were receiving behavioral health services from a private provider agency, either in an out of home placement (e.g., foster care home, a group home or a residential treatment facility) or in their own home (through the In-Home Services Program). The findings suggest the prevalence of symptoms in each of the domains (i.e., conduct problems, emotional problems, ADHD, and peer problems) were relatively high compared to the general population. Over 50% of the youth had conduct problems in the borderline or abnormal range, more than 35% had hyperactivity and peer problems subscale scores in the borderline or abnormal range, and almost 25% of the youth reported symptoms of emotional problems in the borderline or abnormal range. Youth's social, emotional and behavioral problems varied by gender, race/ethnicity and age group.

Abstract:Wavefront encoding (WFE) with different cubic phase mask designs was investigated in engineering 3D point-spread functions (PSF) to reduce their sensitivity to depth-induced spherical aberration (SA) which affects computational complexity in 3D microscopy imaging. The sensitivity of WFE-PSFs to defocus and to SA was evaluated as a function of phase mask parameters using mean-square-error metrics to facilitate the selection of mask designs for extended-depth-of-field (EDOF) microscopy and for computational optical sectioning microscopy (COSM). Further studies on pupil phase contribution and simulated WFE-microscope images evaluated the engineered PSFs and demonstrated SA insensitivity over sample depths of 30 mum. Despite its low sensitivity to SA, the successful WFE design for COSM maintains a high sensitivity to defocus as it is desired for optical sectioning.

Abstract:Bedside microcomputer-derived, minute-to-minute mean arterial pressure (MAP) values during the first 48 hours of life were studied in 100 preterm babies with birth weight less than or equal to 1500 gm. In those babies (n = 72) with no periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH) or with grade 1 PV-IVH, the MAP values increased during the study period, with minute-to-minute variation and interval undulation. The MAP values in those with birth weight greater than 1000 gm were higher than in those of lower birth weight. Infants in whom grades 2 to 4 PV-IVH developed (n = 28) had consistently lower MAP values during the study period. Minute-to-minute variability, expressed as the average of the coefficients of variation at 15-minute intervals, did not differ between birth weight groups, nor did they differ between the PV-IVH group and their matched control subjects. However, those with PV-IVH spent a greater percentage of time, with a coefficient of variation greater than or equal to 13% or less than 3%, than their matched control subjects spent (p less than 0.005). This study provides reference data for MAP changes in premature babies. The observed MAP changes in those with PV-IVH lend support to a significant role for MAP alterations in the pathogenesis of PV-IVH.

Title:The effects of dissociation on information processing for analogue trauma and neutral stimuli: a laboratory study.

Abstract:This study investigated the effects of high and low levels of dissociation on information processing for analogue trauma and neutral stimuli. Fifty-four undergraduate females who reported high and low levels of trait dissociation were presented with two films, one depicting traumatic events, the other containing neutral material. Participants completed a divided attention task (yielding a proxy measure of attention), as well as explicit memory (free-recall) and implicit memory (word-stem completion) tasks for both films. Results indicated that the high DES group showed less attention and had poorer recall for the analogue trauma stimuli, relative to the neutral stimuli and the low DES group. These findings suggest that high levels of trait dissociation are associated with reductions in attention and memory for analogue trauma stimuli, relative to neutral stimuli and relative to low trait dissociation. Implications for the role of cognitive factors in the etiology of negative post-trauma responses are discussed.

Abstract:INTRODUCTION: Tobacco use remains a major public health problem worldwide. Water-pipe smoking is spreading rapidly and threatening to undermine the successes achieved in tobacco control. METHODS: A school-based longitudinal study in the city of Irbid, Jordan, was performed from 2008 to 2010. All seventh-grade students in 19 randomly selected schools, out of a total of 60 schools in the city, were enrolled at baseline and surveyed annually. RESULTS: Of the 1781 students enrolled at baseline 1,701 (95.5%) were still in the study at the end of the second year of follow-up (869 boys, median age at baseline 13 years). Ever and current water-pipe smoking were higher than those of cigarette smoking at baseline (ever smoking: 25.9% vs. 17.6% and current smoking: 13.3% vs. 5.3% for water-pipe and cigarette smoking, respectively; p < .01 for both) but cigarette smoking caught up by the second year of follow-up (ever smoking: 46.4% vs. 44.7%; p = .32 and current smoking: 18.9% vs. 14.9%; p < .01). Water pipe-only smokers at baseline were twice as likely to become current cigarette smokers after 2 years compared with never smokers (relative risk (RR) = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.2, 3.4). A similar pattern was observed for cigarette-only smokers at baseline (RR = 2.0; 95% CI = 0.9, 4.8). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of water-pipe and cigarette smoking increased dramatically over the 2-year follow-up period with similar patterns in boys and girls, although girls had lower prevalence in all categories. Water-pipe smoking at baseline predicted the progress to cigarette smoking in the future and vice versa.

Title:Uptake, incorporation and metabolism of (3H)triolein in the isolated perfused rabbit heart.

Abstract:The purpose of these experiments was to study the uptake and metabolism of exogenous triglyceride in the isolated perfused rabbit heart. When infused into the rabbit heart, [9,10-3H(N)]triolein was retained and incorporated into a lipid fraction that had the chromatographic mobility of authentic triolein. Incorporation of labeled triolein was not likely to be the result of a lipoprotein lipase-mediated lipolysis/resynthesis cycle, since: (i) The distribution of radioactivity following administration of [3H]oleic acid was markedly different from the distribution of radioactivity following the administration of [3H]triolein; (ii) heparin was administered to the rabbits at the time of sacrifice; and (iii) the hearts were perfused with a protein-free buffer for 20 min prior to the labelling period. When isoproterenol was administered to hearts labelled with [3H]triolein, there was an increased output of total radioactivity, composed of labelled free fatty acids, diacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol. In these same hearts, there was an increased output of glycerol in response to isoproterenol. However, following the administration of bradykinin or angiotensin II, neither the radioactivity nor the glycerol content of the perfusate was changed. These data suggest that [3H]triolein is selectively incorporated into the triglyceride pool of the isolated perfused rabbit heart. Furthermore, this [3H]triolein is available to hormonally-activated lipolytic enzymes.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination is recommended for immunocompromised patients. METHODS: Children (6 months to 21 years) with cancer, HIV infection, or sickle cell disease (SCD) received 1 or 2 doses of pandemic 2009 H1N1 monovalent influenza vaccine (H1N1 MIV). Safety and tolerability, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) antibody titers were measured against 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus after each dose. Seroprotection (SP) and seroconversion (SC) rates were determined. RESULTS: 103 participants were enrolled and 99 were evaluable (39 with HIV, 37 with cancer and 23 with SCD). Mean age (+/-SD) was 7.9 (+/-5.4) years for cancer participants, 18.0 (+/-3.5) for HIV, and 13.3 (+/-4.2) for SCD. 54% were males; 65% black; and 96% had received seasonal influenza vaccine. HIV-infected participants had a median CD4 count of 625 cells/mm(3) (range, 140-1260). 46% had an undetectable HIV viral load and 41% were perinatally infected. No participant had vaccine-related serious adverse events. None developed influenza A proven illness during the 6 months after the vaccine. Local injection reactions were reported in 29% and systemic reactions in 42% after the first dose of vaccine. SC and SP were achieved after the last dose in 48% and 52%, respectively, of participants with leukemia or lymphoma, 50% and 75% of participants with solid tumors, 63% and 92% of HIV-infected participants, and 74% and 100% of participants with SCD. CONCLUSION: H1N1 MIV was safe and well tolerated. H1N1 MIV resulted in an adequate immune response in children with SCD. It was only modestly immunogenic in cancer or HIV participants.

Title:Latent Semantic Indexing of PubMed abstracts for identification of transcription factor candidates from microarray derived gene sets.
Authors:['Roy S', 'Heinrich K', 'Phan V', 'Berry MW', 'Homayouni R']

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Identification of transcription factors (TFs) responsible for modulation of differentially expressed genes is a key step in deducing gene regulatory pathways. Most current methods identify TFs by searching for presence of DNA binding motifs in the promoter regions of co-regulated genes. However, this strategy may not always be useful as presence of a motif does not necessarily imply a regulatory role. Conversely, motif presence may not be required for a TF to regulate a set of genes. Therefore, it is imperative to include functional (biochemical and molecular) associations, such as those found in the biomedical literature, into algorithms for identification of putative regulatory TFs that might be explicitly or implicitly linked to the genes under investigation. RESULTS: In this study, we present a Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) based text mining approach for identification and ranking of putative regulatory TFs from microarray derived differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Two LSI models were built using different term weighting schemes to devise pair-wise similarities between 21,027 mouse genes annotated in the Entrez Gene repository. Amongst these genes, 433 were designated TFs in the TRANSFAC database. The LSI derived TF-to-gene similarities were used to calculate TF literature enrichment p-values and rank the TFs for a given set of genes. We evaluated our approach using five different publicly available microarray datasets focusing on TFs Rel, Stat6, Ddit3, Stat5 and Nfic. In addition, for each of the datasets, we constructed gold standard TFs known to be functionally relevant to the study in question. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves showed that the log-entropy LSI model outperformed the tf-normal LSI model and a benchmark co-occurrence based method for four out of five datasets, as well as motif searching approaches, in identifying putative TFs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that our LSI based text mining approach can complement existing approaches used in systems biology research to decipher gene regulatory networks by providing putative lists of ranked TFs that might be explicitly or implicitly associated with sets of DEGs derived from microarray experiments. In addition, unlike motif searching approaches, LSI based approaches can reveal TFs that may indirectly regulate genes.

Title:Computational identification and experimental characterization of substrate binding determinants of nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 7.
Authors:['Parrill AL', 'Wanjala IW', 'Pham TC', 'Baker DL']

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 7 (NPP7) is the only member of the mammalian NPP enzyme family that has been confirmed to act as a sphingomyelinase, hydrolyzing sphingomyelin (SM) to form phosphocholine and ceramide. NPP7 additionally hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), a substrate preference shared with the NPP2/autotaxin(ATX) and NPP6 mammalian family members. This study utilizes a synergistic combination of molecular modeling validated by experimental site-directed mutagenesis to explore the molecular basis for the unique ability of NPP7 to hydrolyze SM. RESULTS: The catalytic function of NPP7 against SM, LPC, platelet activating factor (PAF) and para-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine (pNPPC) is impaired in the F275A mutant relative to wild type NPP7, but different impacts are noted for mutations at other sites. These results are consistent with a previously described role of F275 to interact with the choline headgroup, where all substrates share a common functionality. The L107F mutation showed enhanced hydrolysis of LPC, PAF and pNPPC but reduced hydrolysis of SM. Modeling suggests this difference can be explained by the gain of cation-pi interactions with the choline headgroups of all four substrates, opposed by increased steric crowding against the sphingoid tail of SM. Modeling also revealed that the long and flexible hydrophobic tails of substrates exhibit considerable dynamic flexibility in the binding pocket, reducing the entropic penalty that might otherwise be incurred upon substrate binding. CONCLUSIONS: Substrate recognition by NPP7 includes several important contributions, ranging from cation-pi interactions between F275 and the choline headgroup of all substrates, to tail-group binding pockets that accommodate the inherent flexibility of the lipid hydrophobic tails. Two contributions to the unique ability of NPP7 to hydrolyze SM were identified. First, the second hydrophobic tail of SM occupies a second hydrophobic binding pocket. Second, the leucine residue present at position 107 contrasts with a conserved phenylalanine in NPP enzymes that do not utilize SM as a substrate, consistent with the observed reduction in SM hydrolysis by the NPP7-L107F mutant.

Affiliation:Department of Physics, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Blebs are balloon-shaped membrane protrusions that form during many physiological processes. Using computer simulation of a particle-based model for self-assembled lipid bilayers coupled to an elastic meshwork, we investigated the phase behavior and kinetics of blebbing. We found that blebs form for large values of the ratio between the areas of the bilayer and the cytoskeleton. We also found that blebbing can be induced when the cytoskeleton is subject to a localized ablation or a uniform compression. The results obtained are qualitatively in agreement with the experimental evidence and the model opens up the possibility to study the kinetics of bleb formation in detail.

Abstract:PURPOSE: Many Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) participants are at increased risk for obesity. The etiology of their obesity is likely multifactorial but not well understood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the potential contribution of demographic, lifestyle, treatment, and intrapersonal factors and self-reported pharmaceutical use to obesity (body mass index >/= 30 kg/m2) among 9,284 adult (> 18 years of age) CCSS participants. Independent predictors were identified using multivariable regression models. Interrelationships were determined using structural equation modeling (SEM). RESULTS: Independent risk factors for obesity included cancer diagnosed at 5 to 9 years of age (relative risk [RR], 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.24; P = .03), abnormal Short Form-36 physical function (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.33; P < .001), hypothalamic/pituitary radiation doses of 20 to 30 Gy (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.30; P = .01), and paroxetine use (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.54; P = .01). Meeting US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for vigorous physical activity (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.97; P = .01) and a medium amount of anxiety (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99; P = .04) reduced the risk of obesity. Results of SEM (N = 8,244; comparative fit index = 0.999; Tucker Lewis index = 0.999; root mean square error of approximation = 0.014; weighted root mean square residual = 0.749) described the hierarchical impact of the direct predictors, moderators, and mediators of obesity. CONCLUSION: Treatment, lifestyle, and intrapersonal factors, as well as the use of specific antidepressants, may contribute to obesity among survivors. A multifaceted intervention, including alternative drug and other therapies for depression and anxiety, may be required to reduce risk.

Abstract:This study examined the impact of a 12-wk. sport stacking intervention on reaction time (RT), manual dexterity, and hand-eye coordination in elementary school-aged children. 80 Grade 2 students participated in a 15-min. sport stacking practice session every school day for 12 wk., and were tested on psychomotor performance improvement. Tests for choice RT, manual dexterity, and photoelectric rotary pursuit tracking were conducted pre- and post-intervention for both experimental group (n = 36) and the controls (n = 44) who did no sport stacking. Students who had the intervention showed a greater improvement in two-choice RT. No other group difference was found. Such sport stacking activities may facilitate children's central processing and perceptual-motor integration.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To evaluate whether influence from social network members is associated with motivation to change dietary and physical activity behaviors. DESIGN: Baseline assessment followed by mailing of family health history-based personalized messages (2 weeks) and follow-up assessment (3 months). SETTING: Families from an ongoing population-based cohort in Houston, Texas. SUBJECTS: 475 adults from 161 Mexican-origin families. Out of 347 households contacted, 162 (47%) participated. MEASURES: Family health history, social networks, and motivation to change behaviors. ANALYSIS: Two-level logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: Having at least one network member who encourages one to eat more fruits and vegetables (p = .010) and to engage in regular physical activity (p = .046) was associated with motivation to change the relevant behavior. About 40% of the participants did not have encouragers for these behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of new encouragers within networks and targeting natural encouragers (e.g., children, spouses) may increase the efficacy of interventions to motivate behavioral changes among Mexican-origin adults.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to determine whether sentence intelligibility improves in speakers with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) as a result of Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT). It was hypothesized that all the speakers would improve following treatment, in association with increased vocal loudness, which was the primary target of the treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of eight Speakers with PD using a single-blinded, randomized pre-post treatment design, with multiple daily assessments before and after treatment was carried out. Resultant data were corrected for regression to the mean. METHODS: Randomized digital recordings of sentences produced by speakers with idiopathic PD before and after the treatment were presented to normal-hearing listeners with equalized intensity at conversational loudness in the presence of pink noise. Percentage of words understood was calculated before and after the treatment. Changes in overall vocal intensity were also analyzed. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant group effect from pre-to-post voice treatment; however, there was also significant interaction of treatment with speakers. Six of the speakers with PD improved significantly following voice treatment, one exhibited no change, and one exhibited a decline in sentence intelligibility post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: LSVT yielded significant improvement in sentence intelligibility for most speakers in the study but was not beneficial for two of the speakers despite the fact that they increased their overall vocal loudness.

Title:High-power resistance exercise induces MAPK phosphorylation in weightlifting trained men.

Abstract:Power is critical to muscle performance, specifically in athletic populations. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK 1/2), p38, and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK)) are intracellular signal transduction mechanisms that partially regulate exercise-induced skeletal muscle alterations. These pathways are highly responsive to exercise, but their reaction to high power, multi-joint resistance exercise is yet to be examined. Nine weightlifting-trained men performed 15 sets of three repetitions of a dynamic clean pull exercise at 85% of their one repetition maximum. Vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained prior to (pre) and after the 8th (mid) and 15th set (post) of exercise. Three subjects returned to serve as non-exercising controls for a similar sequence of biopsies (CON). The ratio of phosphorylated MAPK to total MAPK increased significantly for p38 (3.0 fold, p < 0.05) and JNK (2.4 fold, p < 0.05) by the mid biopsy. ERK 1/2 phosphorylation followed a similar trend (2.3 fold) (p = 0.052). The ratio of phosphorylation to total MAPK did not differ from mid to post biopsy. None of the pathways were phosphorylated above resting in the CON condition (p > 0.05), and thus the biopsy procedure itself did not account for the entire increase in MAPK phosphorylation during EX. These data indicate MAPK pathways are activated early and remain elevated throughout the duration of high power resistance exercise. These findings help describe the mechanisms partially responsible for chronic adaptations in response to high intensity, high power resistance training in humans.

Xenobiotics, such as pesticides, and pathogenic biotic perturbations, including the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), have played major roles in amphibian decreases. We conducted laboratory culture studies to determine the effects of three pesticides {carbaryl, glyphosate, and thiophanate-methyl [TM; Topsin-M(R) (Cerexagri-Nisso LLC)]} on Bd zoospore production and zoosporangia growth. We applied Bd to pesticides mixed in an agar culture to simulate pathogen introduction to a system with pre-existing pesticides (Bd addition). Alternatively, pesticides were applied to pre-established Bd to simulate pesticide introduction after Bd establishment (pesticide addition). We then measured Bd zoosporangia and zoospore production. All pesticides significantly inhibited zoospore production; however, glyphosate and TM were more effective at doing so than carbaryl. In addition, only carbaryl and glyphosate inhibited zoosporangia production. Our data suggest that carbaryl and glyphosate are equally effective at inhibiting both zoosporangia and zoospore production; however, TM is selectively toxic to zoospores but not zoosporangia. One possible explanation for this observation could be that TM is toxic to zoospores but not the protective zoosporangia. In the case of pesticides applied to established Bd cultures, all pesticides caused significant mortality in both zoosporangia and zoospores, and no differences were found among pesticides. We conclude that examining pesticide and pathogen interactions independent of hosts provides mechanistic understanding of such interactions before and after host infection or contamination.

Abstract:Drop vertical jumps (DVJs) stimulate enhanced countermovement loading as would occur with a run-up before jumping. A variety of performance variables have been associated with DVJ performance including ground contact time (GCT), reactive strength index (RSI), eccentric utilization ratio (EUR), and elasticity index (EI). This study examined the stability reliability and precision of these variables and their associations with DVJ displacement in trained men and women. The EUR and EI measures were redundant, so only EUR findings were reported. Except for EUR, data for all variables were both reliable and precise (intraclass correlation coefficient >/= 0.70, coefficient of variation [CV%] </= 15.0) although EUR data were precise (CV% </= 15.0). Correlations with DVJ displacement were low for GCT, moderate for RSI, and negligible for EUR. Therefore, GCT and EUR likely represent unique performance characteristics not related to DVJ displacement. Furthermore, the variability in DVJ performance accounted for by RSI may primarily reflect the inclusion of displacement as the numerator in the quotient for calculating it.

Title:Signaling via the kinase p38alpha programs dendritic cells to drive TH17 differentiation and autoimmune inflammation.

Abstract:Dendritic cells (DCs) bridge innate and adaptive immunity, but how DC-derived signals regulate T cell lineage choices remains unclear. We report here that the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38alpha programmed DCs to drive the differentiation of the T(H)17 subset of helper T cells. Deletion of p38alpha in DCs protected mice from T(H)17 cell-mediated autoimmune neuroinflammation, but deletion of p38alpha in macrophages or T cells did not. We also found that p38alpha orchestrated the expression of cytokines and costimulatory molecules in DCs and further 'imprinted' signaling via the receptor for interleukin 23 (IL-23R) in responding T cells to promote T(H)17 differentiation. Moreover, p38alpha was required for tissue-infiltrating DCs to sustain T(H)17 responses. This activity of p38alpha was conserved in mouse and human DCs and was dynamically regulated by pattern recognition and fungal infection. Our results identify p38alpha signaling as a central pathway for the integration of instructive signals in DCs for T(H)17 differentiation and inflammation.

Abstract:Retinoblastoma is an aggressive childhood cancer of the developing retina that is initiated by the biallelic loss of RB1. Tumours progress very quickly following RB1 inactivation but the underlying mechanism is not known. Here we show that the retinoblastoma genome is stable, but that multiple cancer pathways can be epigenetically deregulated. To identify the mutations that cooperate with RB1 loss, we performed whole-genome sequencing of retinoblastomas. The overall mutational rate was very low; RB1 was the only known cancer gene mutated. We then evaluated the role of RB1 in genome stability and considered non-genetic mechanisms of cancer pathway deregulation. For example, the proto-oncogene SYK is upregulated in retinoblastoma and is required for tumour cell survival. Targeting SYK with a small-molecule inhibitor induced retinoblastoma tumour cell death in vitro and in vivo. Thus, retinoblastomas may develop quickly as a result of the epigenetic deregulation of key cancer pathways as a direct or indirect result of RB1 loss.

Abstract:Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ETP ALL) is an aggressive malignancy of unknown genetic basis. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 12 ETP ALL cases and assessed the frequency of the identified somatic mutations in 94 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cases. ETP ALL was characterized by activating mutations in genes regulating cytokine receptor and RAS signalling (67% of cases; NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, IL7R, JAK3, JAK1, SH2B3 and BRAF), inactivating lesions disrupting haematopoietic development (58%; GATA3, ETV6, RUNX1, IKZF1 and EP300) and histone-modifying genes (48%; EZH2, EED, SUZ12, SETD2 and EP300). We also identified new targets of recurrent mutation including DNM2, ECT2L and RELN. The mutational spectrum is similar to myeloid tumours, and moreover, the global transcriptional profile of ETP ALL was similar to that of normal and myeloid leukaemia haematopoietic stem cells. These findings suggest that addition of myeloid-directed therapies might improve the poor outcome of ETP ALL.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To compare patterns of water pipe and cigarette smoking in an eastern Mediterranean country. METHODS: In 2008, 1781 out of 1877 seventh graders enrolled in 19 randomly selected schools in Irbid, Jordan, were surveyed. RESULTS: Experimentation with and current water pipe smoking were more prevalent than cigarette smoking (boys: 38.7% vs 26.8%; 20.2% vs 9.0%, girls: 21.2% vs 9.5%; and 7.5% vs 2.3%, P<0.05 for all). Parent- and peer-smoking correlated more strongly with water pipe than with cigarette smoking. CONCLUSION: Water-pipe smoking is more prevalent than cigarette smoking at this early age.

Abstract:Geographic Atrophy (GA) of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is an advanced form of atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and is responsible for about 20% of AMD-related legal blindness in the United States. Two different imaging modalities for retinas, infrared imaging and autofluorescence imaging, serve as interesting complimentary technologies for highlighting GA. In this work we explore the use of neural network classifiers in performing segmentation of GA in registered infrared (IR) and autofluorescence (AF) images. Our segmentation achieved a performance level of 82.5% sensitivity and 92.9% specificity on a per-pixel basis using hold-one-out validation testing. The algorithm, feature extraction, data set and experimental results are discussed and shown.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Sport drinks are ubiquitous within the recreational and competitive fitness and sporting world. Most are manufactured and artificially flavored carbohydrate-electrolyte beverages. Recently, attention has been given to coconut water, a natural alternative to manufactured sport drinks, with initial evidence indicating efficacy with regard to maintaining hydration. We compared coconut water and a carbohydrate-electrolyte sport drink on measures of hydration and physical performance in exercise-trained men. METHODS: Following a 60-minute bout of dehydrating treadmill exercise, 12 exercise-trained men (26.6 +/- 5.7 yrs) received bottled water (BW), pure coconut water (VitaCoco(R): CW), coconut water from concentrate (CWC), or a carbohydrate-electrolyte sport drink (SD) [a fluid amount based on body mass loss during the dehydrating exercise] on four occasions (separated by at least 5 days) in a random order, single blind (subject and not investigators), cross-over design. Hydration status (body mass, fluid retention, plasma osmolality, urine specific gravity) and performance (treadmill time to exhaustion; assessed after rehydration) were determined during the recovery period. Subjective measures of thirst, bloatedness, refreshed, stomach upset, and tiredness were also determined using a 5-point visual analog scale. RESULTS: Subjects lost approximately 1.7 kg (~2% of body mass) during the dehydrating exercise and regained this amount in a relatively similar manner following consumption of all conditions. No differences were noted between coconut water (CW or CWC) and SD for any measures of fluid retention (p > 0.05). Regarding exercise performance, no significant difference (p > 0.05) was noted between BW (11.9 +/- 5.9 min), CW (12.3 +/- 5.8 min), CWC (11.9 +/- 6.0 min), and SD (12.8 +/- 4.9 min). In general, subjects reported feeling more bloated and experienced greater stomach upset with the CW and CWC conditions. CONCLUSION: All tested beverages are capable of promoting rehydration and supporting subsequent exercise. Little difference is noted between the four tested conditions with regard to markers of hydration or exercise performance in a sample of young, healthy men. Additional study inclusive of a more demanding dehydration protocol, as well as a time trial test as the measure of exercise performance, may more specifically determine the efficacy of these beverages on enhancing hydration and performance following dehydrating exercise.

Affiliation:School of Public Health, University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. lisa.klesges@memphis.edu
Abstract:CONTEXT: To aid translation of childhood obesity interventions evidence into practice, research studies must report results in a way that better supports pragmatic decision making. The current review evaluated the extent to which information on key external validity dimensions, participants, settings, interventions, outcomes, and maintenance of effects, was included in research studies on behavioral treatments for childhood obesity. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Peer-reviewed studies of behavioral childhood obesity treatments published between 1980 and 2008 were identified from (1) electronic searches of social science and medical databases; (2) research reviews of childhood obesity interventions; and (3) reference lists cited in these reviews. Included studies reported on a controlled obesity intervention trial, targeted overweight or obese children aged 2-18 years, included a primary or secondary anthropometric outcome, and targeted change in dietary intake or physical activity behaviors. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: 1071 publications were identified and 77 met selection criteria. Studies were coded on established review criteria for external validity elements. All studies lacked full reporting of generalizability elements. Across criteria, the average reporting was 23.9% (range=0%-100%). Infrequently reported were setting-level selection criteria and representativeness, characteristics regarding intervention staff, implementation of the intervention content, costs, and program sustainability. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced reporting of relevant and pragmatic information in behavioral investigations of childhood obesity interventions is needed to improve the ability to evaluate the applicability of results to practice implementation. Such evidence would improve translation of research to practice, provide additional explanation for variability in intervention outcomes, and provide insights into successful adaptations of interventions to local conditions.

Abstract:This article describes the results of three studies designed to understand better the journal operations, publishing practices, and impact of school psychology journals in recent years. The first study presents the results of a survey focusing on journal operations and peer-review practices that was completed by 61 journal editors of school psychology and aligned journals. The second study presents the results of review and classification of all articles appearing in one volume year for nine school psychology journals (i.e., The California School Psychologist, Canadian Journal of School Psychology, Journal of Applied School Psychology, Journal of School Psychology, Psychology in the Schools, School Psychology Forum, School Psychology International, School Psychology Quarterly, and School Psychology Review). The third study employed multilevel modeling to investigate differences in the longitudinal trends of impact factor data for five school psychology journals listed in the Web of Science (i.e., Journal of School Psychology, Psychology in the Schools, School Psychology International, School Psychology Quarterly, and School Psychology Review). The article addresses implications for authors, editors, and journal editorial teams as well as the status and impact of school psychology journals.

Affiliation:Department of Nursing, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. dr.gnay@gmail.com
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To describe breastfeeding pain reported by breastfeeding women during the first-year postpartum and providers' management of the pain as recorded in medical records. DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive. SETTING: Mid-South metropolitan obstetric and gynecologic medical practice. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 117 breastfeeding women. METHODS: Data were collected using a retrospective review of medical records of breastfeeding mothers during their infants' first year of life. RESULTS: Participants reported a breastfeeding rate of 56.4%, and of those 23% reported breastfeeding pain during the first year. Major reasons for pain were mastitis (67.5%), candida (32.4%), engorgement (18.0%), nipple tenderness (8.1%), and clogged milk ducts (4.5%). Medications were used most frequently to treat mastitis and candida. However, limited documentation of breastfeeding support beyond prescribing medications was found. Nonpharmacological measures were rarely recommended, and few referrals were documented to specialized providers such as lactation consultants or community support groups. Routine infant feeding choices, breastfeeding discussions, and breastfeeding counseling were rarely documented and multiple non-evidence-based strategies were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate breastfeeding support and management were evident, and non-evidence-based recommendations were routinely practiced. It is recommended that primary care providers adopt evidence-based practices for breastfeeding and breastfeeding pain that support women in successfully reaching their breastfeeding goals.

Title:Blood/air distribution of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a nationally representative sample.
Authors:['Jia C', 'Yu X', 'Masiak W']

Abstract:Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in human blood are an effective biomarker of environmental exposure and are closely linked to health outcomes. Unlike VOC concentrations in air, which are routinely collected, blood VOC data are not as readily available. This study aims to develop the quantitative relationship between air and blood VOCs by deriving population-based blood/air distribution coefficients (popKs) of ten common VOCs in the general U.S. population. Air and human blood samples were collected from 364 adults aged 20-59 years in 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Determinants of popKs were identified using weighted multivariate regression models. In the non-smoking population, median popKs ranged from 3.1 to 77.3, comparable to values obtained in the laboratory. PopKs decreased with increasing airborne VOC concentrations. Smoking elevated popKs by 1.5-3.5 times for aromatic compounds, but did not affect the popKs for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) or chlorinated compounds. Drinking water concentration was a modifier of MTBE's popK. Age, gender, body composition, nor ethnicity affected popKs. PopKs were predictable using linear models with air concentration as the independent variable for both adults and children. This is the first study to estimate blood/air distribution coefficients using simultaneous environmental and biological monitoring on a national population sample. This study was also the first to determine the blood/air distribution coefficient of p-dichlorobenzene, a compound frequently found in indoor environments. These results have applications in exposure assessment, pharmacokinetic analysis, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, and uncertainty analysis.

Title:TwinMARM: two-stage multiscale adaptive regression methods for twin neuroimaging data.

Abstract:Twin imaging studies have been valuable for understanding the relative contribution of the environment and genes on brain structures and their functions. Conventional analyses of twin imaging data include three sequential steps: spatially smoothing imaging data, independently fitting a structural equation model at each voxel, and finally correcting for multiple comparisons. However, conventional analyses are limited due to the same amount of smoothing throughout the whole image, the arbitrary choice of smoothing extent, and the decreased power in detecting environmental and genetic effects introduced by smoothing raw images. The goal of this paper is to develop a two-stage multiscale adaptive regression method (TwinMARM) for spatial and adaptive analysis of twin neuroimaging and behavioral data. The first stage is to establish the relationship between twin imaging data and a set of covariates of interest, such as age and gender. The second stage is to disentangle the environmental and genetic influences on brain structures and their functions. In each stage, TwinMARM employs hierarchically nested spheres with increasing radii at each location and then captures spatial dependence among imaging observations via consecutively connected spheres across all voxels. Simulation studies show that our TwinMARM significantly outperforms conventional analyses of twin imaging data. Finally, we use our method to detect statistically significant effects of genetic and environmental variations on white matter structures in a neonatal twin study.

Abstract:Abcb6 is a mammalian mitochondrial ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that regulates de novo porphyrin synthesis. In previous studies, haploinsufficient (Abcb6(+/-)) embryonic stem cells showed impaired porphyrin synthesis. Unexpectedly, Abcb6(-/-) mice derived from these stem cells appeared phenotypically normal. We hypothesized that other ATP-dependent and/or -independent mechanisms conserve porphyrins. Here, we demonstrate that Abcb6(-/-) mice lack mitochondrial ATP-driven import of coproporphyrin III. Gene expression analysis revealed that loss of Abcb6 results in up-regulation of compensatory porphyrin and iron pathways, associated with elevated protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). Phenylhydrazine-induced stress caused higher mortality in Abcb6(-/-) mice, possibly because of sustained elevation of PPIX and an inability to convert PPIX to heme despite elevated ferrochelatase levels. Therefore, Abcb6 is the sole ATP-dependent porphyrin importer, and loss of Abcb6 produces up-regulation of heme and iron pathways necessary for normal development. However, under extreme demand for porphyrins (e.g. phenylhydrazine stress), these adaptations appear inadequate, which suggests that under these conditions Abcb6 is important for optimal survival.

Title:Transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-dependent checkpoint in the survival of dendritic cells promotes immune homeostasis and function.

Abstract:Homeostatic control of dendritic cell (DC) survival is crucial for adaptive immunity, but the molecular mechanism is not well defined. Moreover, how DCs influence immune homeostasis under steady state remains unclear. Combining DC-specific and -inducible deletion systems, we report that transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is an essential regulator of DC survival and immune system homeostasis and function. Deficiency of TAK1 in CD11c(+) cells induced markedly elevated apoptosis, leading to the depletion of DC populations, especially the CD8(+) and CD103(+) DC subsets in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues, respectively. TAK1 also contributed to DC development by promoting the generation of DC precursors. Prosurvival signals from Toll-like receptors, CD40 and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (RANK) are integrated by TAK1 in DCs, which in turn mediated activation of downstream NF-kappaB and AKT-Foxo pathways and established a gene-expression program. TAK1 deficiency in DCs caused a myeloid proliferative disorder characterized by expansion of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, disrupted T-cell homeostasis, and prevented effective T-cell priming and generation of regulatory T cells. Moreover, TAK1 signaling in DCs was required to prevent myeloid proliferation even in the absence of lymphocytes, indicating a previously unappreciated regulatory mechanism of DC-mediated control of myeloid cell-dependent inflammation. Therefore, TAK1 orchestrates a prosurvival checkpoint in DCs that affects the homeostasis and function of the immune system.

Title:Reconstructing meaning in bereavement.
Authors:['Neimeyer RA']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, TN, USA. neimeyer@mac.com
Abstract:Bereavement, in the form of the loss of a significant attachment figure to death, disrupts the self-narratives of survivors, and typically launches them into an unsought quest for meaning in the loss as well as in their changed lives. A growing body of research on diverse groups - bereaved parents, young people, elders - suffering loss through both natural and violent death, documents the link between inability to find meaning in the experience and the intensity of complicated grief they suffer. This article reviews this literature, arguing that processes of sense-making and benefit-finding play a crucial role in bereavement adaptation for many of the bereaved, and accordingly that interventions that facilitate processes of meaning reconstruction can support effective psychotherapy for those struggling with intense and prolonged grief.

Abstract:A significant gap exists in our understanding of subchondral and cancellous bone changes that may regulate osteoarthritis progression. Herein, we complement our prior osteochondrogenesis work with growth factor elution and monocyte and endothelial cell activation using two biomaterial formulations. The design of these biomaterials was inspired by the roles of a fracture hematoma, more specifically, the potential of significant cross-talk among cells and cellular factors that affect bone remodeling. Biomaterials, referred to herein as F1+ and F2+, are human concentrated platelet releasate-containing alginate/beta-tricalcium phosphate composites. F1+ has a higher calcium phosphate volume percentage and lower alginate polymer weight percent hydrogel versus F2+. The majority of releasate-derived platelet-derived growth factor eluted over 24 h for F1+ and 48 h for F2+, suggesting sustained release with an increase in alginate weight percentage. Simple monocyte and endothelial cell migration studies demonstrated 650% and 900% increases with F1+ eluate over medium alone, respectively. Induction of endothelial cell invasion over supplemented medium positive control was also shown for F2+ eluate (p = 0.03) with F1+ eluate being similar to the control. Monocyte transendothelial migration was increased over 300% and 400% for F1+ and F2+ eluates compared with medium alone, respectively. In addition, F1+ and F2+ eluates induced spontaneous endothelial tube formations similar to supplemented medium, demonstrating a well-formed network of capillary-like structures. This work demonstrated our biomaterial formulations ability to induce characteristics in vitro that parallel the in vivo behavior of fracture hematomas and potential to induce bone remodeling for the early treatment of osteoarthritic joints.

Abstract:There are few effective obesity interventions directed towards younger children, particularly young minority children. This paper describes the design, intervention, recruitment methods, and baseline data of the ongoing Positive Lifestyles for Active Youngsters (Team PLAY) study. This randomized controlled trial is designed to test the efficacy of a 6-month, moderately intense, primary care feasible, family-based behavioral intervention, targeting both young children and their parent, in promoting healthy weight change. Participants are 270 overweight and obese children (ages 4 to 7 years) and their parents, who were recruited from a primarily African American urban population. Parents and children were instructed in proven cognitive behavioral techniques (e.g. goal setting, self-talk, stimulus control and reinforcement) designed to encourage healthier food choices (more whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and less concentrated fats and sugar), reduce portion sizes, decrease sweetened beverages and increase moderate to vigorous physical activity engagement. The main outcome of this study is change in BMI at two year post enrollment. Recruitment using reactive methods (mailings, TV ads, pamphlets) was found to be more successful than using only a proactive approach (referral through physicians). At baseline, most children were very obese with an average BMI z-score of 2.6. Reported intake of fruits and vegetables and minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity engagement did not meet national recommendations. If efficacious, Team PLAY would offer a model for obesity treatment directed at families with young children that could be tested and translated to both community and primary care settings.

Title:Disruption of Kif3a in osteoblasts results in defective bone formation and osteopenia.

Abstract:We investigated whether Kif3a in osteoblasts has a direct role in regulating postnatal bone formation. We conditionally deleted Kif3a in osteoblasts by crossing osteocalcin (Oc; also known as Bglap)-Cre with Kif3a(flox/null) mice. Conditional Kif3a-null mice (Kif3a(Oc-cKO)) had a 75% reduction in Kif3a transcripts in bone and osteoblasts. Conditional deletion of Kif3a resulted in the reduction of primary cilia number by 51% and length by 27% in osteoblasts. Kif3a(Oc-cKO) mice developed osteopenia by 6 weeks of age unlike Kif3a(flox/+) control mice, as evidenced by reductions in femoral bone mineral density (22%), trabecular bone volume (42%) and cortical thickness (17%). By contrast, Oc-Cre;Kif3a(flox/+) and Kif3a(flox/null) heterozygous mice exhibited no skeletal abnormalities. Loss of bone mass in Kif3a(Oc-cKO) mice was associated with impaired osteoblast function in vivo, as reflected by a 54% reduction in mineral apposition rate and decreased expression of Runx2, osterix (also known as Sp7 transcription factor 7; Sp7), osteocalcin and Dmp1 compared with controls. Immortalized osteoblasts from Kif3a(Oc-cKO) mice exhibited increased cell proliferation, impaired osteoblastic differentiation, and enhanced adipogenesis in vitro. Osteoblasts derived from Kif3a(Oc-cKO) mice also had lower basal cytosolic calcium levels and impaired intracellular calcium responses to fluid flow shear stress. Sonic hedgehog-mediated Gli2 expression and Wnt3a-mediated beta-catenin and Axin2 expression were also attenuated in Kif3a(Oc-cKO) bone and osteoblast cultures. These data indicate that selective deletion of Kif3a in osteoblasts disrupts primary cilia formation and/or function and impairs osteoblast-mediated bone formation through multiple pathways including intracellular calcium, hedgehog and Wnt signaling.

Abstract:Genetic control of gene expression and higher-order phenotypes is almost invariably dependent on environment and experimental conditions. We use two families of recombinant inbred strains of mice (LXS and BXD) to study treatment- and genotype-dependent control of hippocampal gene expression and behavioral phenotypes. We analyzed responses to all combinations of two experimental perturbations, ethanol and restraint stress, in both families, allowing for comparisons across 8 combinations of treatment and population. We introduce the concept of QTL activity patterns to characterize how associations between genomic loci and traits vary across treatments. We identified several significant behavioral QTLs and many expression QTLs (eQTLs). The behavioral QTLs are highly dependent on treatment and population. We classified eQTLs into three groups: cis-eQTLs (expression variation that maps to within 5 Mb of the cognate gene), syntenic trans-eQTLs (the gene and the QTL are on the same chromosome but not within 5 Mb), and non-syntenic trans-eQTLs (the gene and the QTL are on different chromosomes). We found that most non-syntenic trans-eQTLs were treatment-specific whereas both classes of syntenic eQTLs were more conserved across treatments. We also found there was a correlation between regions along the genome enriched for eQTLs and SNPs that were conserved across the LXS and BXD families. Genes with eQTLs that co-localized with the behavioral QTLs and displayed similar QTL activity patterns were identified as potential candidate genes associated with the phenotypes, yielding identification of novel genes as well as genes that have been previously associated with responses to ethanol.

Title:Effect of grip width on electromyographic activity during the upright row.
Authors:['McAllister MJ', 'Schilling BK', 'Hammond KG', 'Weiss LW', 'Farney TM']
Affiliation:Exercise Neuromechanics Laboratory, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:The upright row (URR) is commonly used to develop the deltoid and upper back musculature. However, little information exists concerning muscle recruitment during variations of this exercise. Sixteen weight-trained men completed 2 repetitions each in the URR with 3 grip conditions: 50, 100, and 200% of the biacromial breadth (BAB). The load was the same for all grip conditions and was equal to 85% of the 1RM determined at 100% BAB. Repeated measures analyses of variance were used to compare the maximal activity of the anterior deltoid (AD), lateral deltoid (LD), posterior deltoid (PD), upper trapezius (UT), middle trapezius (MT), and biceps brachii (BB) during the 3 grip widths for eccentric and concentric actions. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were noted in concentric muscle activity for LD (p < 0.001) and PD (p < 0.001), and in eccentric muscle activity for AD (p = 0.023), LD (p < 0.001), UT (p < 0.001), MT (p < 0.001), and BB (p = 0.003). Bonferroni post hoc analysis revealed significant pairwise differences in the concentric actions from the LD (50% vs. 200% BAB and 100% vs. 200% BAB) and PD (50% vs. 200% BAB and 100% vs. 200% BAB), and eccentric actions of the LD (all comparisons), UT (all comparisons), MT (50% vs. 200% BAB and 100% vs. 200% BAB), and BB (50% vs. 200% BAB), with large-to-very-large effect sizes (ESs). Moderate-to-large ESs were noted for several nonsignificant comparisons. The main findings of this investigation are increased deltoid and trapezius activity with increasing grip width, and correspondingly less BB activity. Therefore, those who seek to maximize involvement of the deltoid and trapezius muscles during the URR should use a wide grip.

Title:Vocabulary learning in a Yorkshire terrier: slow mapping of spoken words.
Authors:['Griebel U', 'Oller DK']
Affiliation:Institute for Intelligent Systems, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America. ulrikegriebel@gmail.com
Abstract:Rapid vocabulary learning in children has been attributed to "fast mapping", with new words often claimed to be learned through a single presentation. As reported in 2004 in Science a border collie (Rico) not only learned to identify more than 200 words, but fast mapped the new words, remembering meanings after just one presentation. Our research tests the fast mapping interpretation of the Science paper based on Rico's results, while extending the demonstration of large vocabulary recognition to a lap dog. We tested a Yorkshire terrier (Bailey) with the same procedures as Rico, illustrating that Bailey accurately retrieved randomly selected toys from a set of 117 on voice command of the owner. Second we tested her retrieval based on two additional voices, one male, one female, with different accents that had never been involved in her training, again showing she was capable of recognition by voice command. Third, we did both exclusion-based training of new items (toys she had never seen before with names she had never heard before) embedded in a set of known items, with subsequent retention tests designed as in the Rico experiment. After Bailey succeeded on exclusion and retention tests, a crucial evaluation of true mapping tested items previously successfully retrieved in exclusion and retention, but now pitted against each other in a two-choice task. Bailey failed on the true mapping task repeatedly, illustrating that the claim of fast mapping in Rico had not been proven, because no true mapping task had ever been conducted with him. It appears that the task called retention in the Rico study only demonstrated success in retrieval by a process of extended exclusion.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To examine unique contributions of depression, alcohol consumption, and alcohol-related consequences on functional health outcomes in college students. METHODS: Participants were heavy-drinking undergraduate students (N = 207) who completed self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: For men and women, depression predicted overall general health and mental health ratings. For women, depression predicted number of days of role limitations due to poor physical or mental health and number of days of not getting enough sleep or rest. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that depression may have a more pervasive association with HRQOL than alcohol misuse or alcohol-related consequences in college students.

Abstract:The physiological role of multidrug resistance protein 4 (Mrp4, Abcc4) in the testes is unknown. We found that Mrp4 is expressed primarily in mouse and human Leydig cells; however, there is no current evidence that Mrp4 regulates testosterone production. We investigated its role in Leydig cells, where testosterone production is regulated by cAMP, an intracellular messenger formed when the luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor is activated. Because Mrp4 regulates cAMP, we compared testosterone levels in Mrp4(-/-) and Mrp4(+/+) mice. Young Mrp4(-/-) mice had significantly impaired gametogenesis, reduced testicular testosterone, and disruption of Leydig cell cAMP homeostasis. Both young and adult mice had impaired testosterone production. In Mrp4(-/-) primary Leydig cells treated with LH, intracellular cAMP production was impaired and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation was strongly attenuated. Notably, expression of CREB target genes that regulate testosterone biosynthesis was reduced in Mrp4(-/-) Leydig cells in vivo. Therefore, Mrp4 is required for normal Leydig cell testosterone production. However, adult Mrp4(-/-) mice are fertile, with a normal circulating testosterone concentration. The difference is that in 3-week-old Mrp4(-/-) mice, disruption of gonadal testosterone production up-regulates hepatic Cyp2b10, a known testosterone-metabolizing enzyme. Therefore, defective testicular testosterone production de-regulates hepatic Cyp-mediated testosterone metabolism to disrupt gametogenesis. These findings have important implications for understanding the side effects of therapeutics that disrupt Mrp4 function and are reported to alter androgen production.

Title:Dye-loaded porous nanocapsules immobilized in a permeable polyvinyl alcohol matrix: a versatile optical sensor platform.

Affiliation:Sensor Institute of the University Memphis (SENSORIUM), Memphis, Tennessee 38152, United States.
Abstract:In this work we report on a versatile sensor platform based on encapsulated indicator dyes. Dyes are entrapped in hollow nanocapsules with nanometer-thin walls of controlled porosity. The porous nanocapsules retain molecules larger than the pore size but provide ultrafast access to their interior for molecules and ions smaller than the pore size. Dye-loaded nanocapsules are immobilized in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix with high solvent permeability and rapid analyte diffusion. This approach provides robust sensing films with fast response and extended lifetime. To demonstrate the performance characteristics of such films, pH-sensitive indicator dyes were entrapped in vesicle-templated nanocapsules prepared by copolymerization of tert-butyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate. As pH sensitive dyes, Nile blue A, bromophenol blue, and acid fuchsin were tested. Time-resolved absorbance measurements showed that the rate of the color change is controlled by the rate of diffusion of protons in the hydrogel. The pH-induced color change in a ~400 mum thick film is complete within 40 and 60 s. The porous nanocapsule loaded films showed excellent stability and reproducibility in long-term monitoring experiments. Compartmentalization of the indicator dyes within the nanocapsules increased their stability. The matrix caused a shift in the position of the color change of the dye compared to that in an aqueous buffer solution. The encapsulation/immobilization protocol described in this account is expected to be broadly applicable to a variety of indicator dyes in optical sensor applications.

Abstract:Large-scale networks with hundreds of thousands of variables and constraints are becoming more and more common in logistics, communications, and distribution domains. Traditionally, the utility functions defined on such networks are optimized using some variation of Linear Programming, such as Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). Despite enormous progress both in hardware (multiprocessor systems and specialized processors) and software (Gurobi) we are reaching the limits of what these tools can handle in real time. Modern logistic problems, for example, call for expanding the problem both vertically (from one day up to several days) and horizontally (combining separate solution stages into an integrated model). The complexity of such integrated models calls for alternative methods of solution, such as Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), which provide a further increase in the performance necessary for the daily operation. In this paper, we present the theoretical basis and related experiments for solving the multistage decision problems based on the results obtained for shorter periods, as building blocks for the models and the solution, via Critic-Model-Action cycles, where various types of neural networks are combined with traditional MIP models in a unified optimization system. In this system architecture, fast and simple feed-forward networks are trained to reasonably initialize more complicated recurrent networks, which serve as approximators of the value function (Critic). The combination of interrelated neural networks and optimization modules allows for multiple queries for the same system, providing flexibility and optimizing performance for large-scale real-life problems. A MATLAB implementation of our solution procedure for a realistic set of data and constraints shows promising results, compared to the iterative MIP approach.

Abstract:Keratinocyte terminal differentiation is the process that ultimately forms the epidermal barrier that is essential for mammalian survival. This process is controlled, in part, by signal transduction and gene expression mechanisms, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is known to be an important regulator of multiple epidermal functions. Using microarray analysis of a confluent cell density-induced model of keratinocyte differentiation, we identified 2,676 genes that are regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), a ligand of the EGFR. We further discovered, and separately confirmed by functional assays, that EGFR activation abrogates all of the known essential processes of keratinocyte differentiation by 1) decreasing the expression of lipid matrix biosynthetic enzymes, 2) regulating numerous genes forming the cornified envelope, and 3) suppressing the expression of tight junction proteins. In organotypic cultures of skin, EGF acted to impair epidermal barrier integrity, as shown by increased transepidermal water loss. As defective epidermal differentiation and disruption of barrier function are primary features of many human skin diseases, we used bioinformatic analyses to identify genes that are known to be associated with skin diseases. Compared with non-EGF-regulated genes, EGF-regulated genes were significantly enriched for skin disease genes. These results provide a systems-level understanding of the actions of EGFR signaling to inhibit keratinocyte differentiation, providing new insight into the role of EGFR imbalance in skin pathogenesis.

Abstract:AIM: To define the potential utility of 20-hydroxyvitamin D(3) (20(OH)D(3)) as a tumorostatic agent, we assessed its in vitro antiproliferative activity and its in vivo toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antitumor activity of 20(OH)D(3) was tested against breast and liver cancer cell lines using colony formation assays. To assess in vivo toxicity, mice were injected with 5-30 mug/kg 20(OH)D(3) intraperitoneally each day for 3 weeks. Blood and organ samples were collected for clinical pathology analyses. RESULTS: 20(OH)D(3) displays similar tumorostatic activity towards MDA-MB-453 and MCF7 breast carcinomas, and HepG2 hepatocarcinoma, in a dose-dependent manner. This compound is not hypercalcemic, does not cause detectable toxicities in liver, kidney, or blood chemistry in mice at a dose as high as 30 mug/kg. In contrast, both 25(OH)D(3) and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) caused severe hypercalcemia at a dose of 2 mug/kg. CONCLUSION: 20(OH)D(3) possesses high efficacy for inhibiting cancer cell proliferation in vitro and is non-toxic in vivo, supporting its further development as a potential anticancer therapeutic agent.

Abstract:The non-naturally occurring 20R epimer of 20-hydroxyvitamin D3 is synthesized based on chemical design and hypothesis. The 20R isomer is separated by semipreparative HPLC, and its structure is characterized. A comparison of 20R isomer to its 20S counterpart in biological evaluation demonstrates that they have different behaviors in antiproliferative and metabolic studies.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To evaluate abilities of 2-aryl-4-benzoyl-imidazoles (ABI) to overcome multidrug resistance (MDR), define their cellular target, and assess in vivo antimelanoma efficacy. METHODS: MDR cell lines that overexpressed P-glycoprotein, MDR-associated proteins, and breast cancer resistance protein were used to evaluate ABI ability to overcome MDR. Cell cycle analysis, molecular modeling, and microtubule imaging were used to define ABI cellular target. SHO mice bearing A375 human melanoma xenograft were used to evaluate ABI in vivo antitumor activity. B16-F10/C57BL mouse melanoma lung metastasis model was used to test ABI efficacy to inhibit tumor lung metastasis. RESULTS: ABIs showed similar potency to MDR cells compared to matching parent cells. ABIs were identified to target tubulin on the colchicine binding site. After 31 days of treatment, ABI-288 dosed at 25 mg/kg inhibited melanoma tumor growth by 69%; dacarbazine at 60 mg/kg inhibited growth by 52%. ABI-274 dosed at 25 mg/kg showed better lung metastasis inhibition than dacarbazine at 60 mg/kg. CONCLUSIONS: This new class of antimitotic compounds can overcome several clinically important drug resistant mechanisms in vitro and are effective in inhibiting melanoma lung metastasis in vivo, supporting their further development.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to investigate the processes involved in, and outcomes of, implementing 3 new state-level, school-oriented childhood obesity policies enacted between 2004 and 2007. METHODS: We followed policy implementation in 8 high schools in Mississippi and Tennessee. We collected data between 2006 and 2009 from interviews with policymakers, administrators, teachers, and students; observations of school-based activities; and documents. RESULTS: Significant barriers to the effective implementation of obesity-related policies emerged. These most notably include a value system that prioritizes performances in standardized tests over physical education (PE) and a varsity sport system that negatively influences opportunities for PE. These and other factors, such as resource constraints and the overloading of school administrators with new policies, mitigate against the implementation of policies designed to promote improvements in student health through PE. CONCLUSIONS: Policies designed to address health and social problems in high-school settings face significant barriers to effective implementation. To have a broad impact, obesity-related policies must be tied to mainstream educational initiatives that both incentivize, and hold accountable, the school-level actors responsible for their implementation.

Title:Actin reorganization as the molecular basis for the regulation of apoptosis in gastrointestinal epithelial cells.
Authors:['Wang Y', 'George SP', 'Srinivasan K', 'Patnaik S', 'Khurana S']
Affiliation:The Department of Physiology, The University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.
Abstract:The gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium is a rapidly renewing tissue in which apoptosis represents part of the overall homeostatic process. Regulation of apoptosis in the GI epithelium is complex with a precise relationship between cell position and apoptosis. Apoptosis occurs spontaneously and in response to radiation and cytotoxic drugs at the base of the crypts. By contrast, the villus epithelial cells are extremely resistant to apoptosis. The molecular mechanism underlying this loss of function of villus epithelial cells to undergo apoptosis shortly after their exit from the crypt is unknown. In this study we demonstrate for the first time, that deletion of two homologous actin-binding proteins, villin and gelsolin renders villus epithelial cells extremely sensitive to apoptosis. Ultrastructural analysis of the villin-gelsolin(-/-) double-knockout mice shows an abnormal accumulation of damaged mitochondria demonstrating that villin and gelsolin function on an early step in the apoptotic signaling at the level of the mitochondria. A characterization of functional and ligand-binding mutants demonstrate that regulated changes in actin dynamics determined by the actin severing activities of villin and gelsolin are required to maintain cellular homeostasis. Our study provides a molecular basis for the regulation of apoptosis in the GI epithelium and identifies cell biological mechanisms that couple changes in actin dynamics to apoptotic cell death.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: We have recently reported that short-term (21-day) dietary modification in accordance with a stringent vegan diet (i.e., a Daniel Fast) lowers blood lipids as well as biomarkers of oxidative stress. However, this work only involved measurements obtained in a fasted state. In the present study, we determined the postprandial response to a high-fat milkshake with regards to blood triglycerides (TAG), biomarkers of oxidative stress, and hemodynamic variables before and following a 21-day Daniel Fast. METHODS: Twenty-two subjects (10 men and 12 women; aged 35 +/- 3 years) completed a 21-day Daniel Fast. To induce oxidative stress, a milkshake (fat = 0.8 g.kg-1; carbohydrate = 1.0 g.kg-1; protein = 0.25 g.kg-1) was consumed by subjects on day one and day 22 in a rested and 12-hour fasted state. Before and at 2 and 4 h after consumption of the milkshake, heart rate (HR) and blood pressure were measured. Blood samples were also collected at these times and analyzed for TAG, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitrate/nitrite (NOx), and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC). RESULTS: A time effect was noted for HR (p = 0.006), with values higher at 2 hr post intake of the milkshake as compared to pre intake (p < 0.05). Diastolic blood pressure was lower post fast as compared to pre fast (p = 0.02), and a trend for lower systolic blood pressure was noted (p = 0.07). Time effects were noted for TAG (p = 0.001), MDA (p < 0.0001), H2O2 (p < 0.0001), AOPP (p < 0.0001), and TEAC (p < 0.0001); all concentrations were higher at 2 h and 4 h post intake compared to pre intake, except for TEAC, which was lower at these times (p < 0.05). A condition effect was noted for NOx (p = 0.02), which was higher post fast as compared to pre fast. No pre/post fast x time interactions were noted (p > 0.05), with the area under the curve from pre to post fast reduced only slightly for TAG (11%), MDA (11%), H2O2 (8%), and AOPP (12%), with a 37% increase noted for NOx. CONCLUSION: Partaking in a 21-day Daniel Fast does not result in a statistically significant reduction in postprandial oxidative stress. It is possible that a longer time course of adherence to the Daniel Fast eating plan may be needed to observe significant findings.

Abstract:The feasibility of using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) sensor nodes is studied in a distributed network, aiming at dynamic surveillance and tracking of ground targets. Data acquisition by low-cost (<$50 US) miniature low-power radar through a wireless mote is described. We demonstrate the detection, ranging and velocity estimation, classification and tracking capabilities of the mini-radar, and compare results to simulations and manual measurements. Furthermore, we supplement the radar output with other sensor modalities, such as acoustic and vibration sensors. This method provides innovative solutions for detecting, identifying, and tracking vehicles and dismounts over a wide area in noisy conditions. This study presents a step towards distributed intelligent decision support and demonstrates effectiveness of small cheap sensors, which can complement advanced technologies in certain real-life scenarios.

Title:Investigation of polyurea-crosslinked silica aerogels as a neuronal scaffold: a pilot study.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Polymer crosslinked aerogels are an attractive class of materials for future implant applications particularly as a biomaterial for the support of nerve growth. The low density and nano-porous structure of this material combined with large surface area, high mechanical strength, and tunable surface properties, make aerogels materials with a high potential in aiding repair of injuries of the peripheral nervous system. however, the interaction of neurons with aerogels remains to be investigated. METHODOLOGY: In this work the attachment and growth of neurons on clear polyurea crosslinked silica aerogels (PCSA) coated with: poly-L-lysine, basement membrane extract (BME), and laminin1 was investigated by means of optical and scanning electron microscopy. After comparing the attachment and growth capability of neurons on these different coatings, laminin1 and BME were chosen for nerve cell attachment and growth on PCSA surfaces. The behavior of neurons on treated petri dish surfaces was used as the control and behavior of neurons on treated PCSA discs was compared against it. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that: 1) untreated PCSA surfaces do not support attachment and growth of nerve cells, 2) a thin application of laminin1 layer onto the PCSA discs adhered well to the PCSA surface while also supporting growth and differentiation of neurons as evidenced by the number of processes extended and b3-tubulin expression, 3) three dimensional porous structure of PCSA remains intact after fixing protocols necessary for preservation of biological samples and 4) laminin1 coating proved to be the most effective method for attaching neurons to the desired regions on PCSA discs. This work provides the basis for potential use of PCSA as a biomaterial scaffold for neural regeneration.

Abstract:A medical sensor network can wirelessly monitor vital signs of humans, making it useful for long-term health care without sacrificing patient comfort and mobility. For such a network to be viable, its design must protect data privacy and authenticity given that medical data are highly sensitive. We identify the unique security challenges of such a sensor network and propose a set of resource-efficient mechanisms to address these challenges. Our solution includes (1) a novel two-tier scheme for verifying the authenticity of patient data, (2) a secure key agreement protocol to set up shared keys between sensor nodes and base stations, and (3) symmetric encryption/decryption for protecting data confidentiality and integrity. We have implemented the proposed mechanisms on a wireless mote platform, and our results confirm their feasibility.

Title:Distinct subunit pairing criteria within the heterodimeric IL-12 cytokine family.
Authors:['Jones LL', 'Chaturvedi V', 'Uyttenhove C', 'Van Snick J', 'Vignali DA']
Affiliation:Department of Immunology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.
Abstract:The heterodimeric IL-12 cytokine family is characterized by the sharing of three alpha (p19, p28, p35) and two beta (p40 and Ebi3) subunits, and includes IL-12 (p35/p40), IL-23 (p19/p40), IL-27 (p28/Ebi3) and IL-35 (p35/Ebi3). In this study, the dimerization interfaces of IL-12 family members were characterized, with emphasis on IL-35. Ebi3 and p35 subunits from human and mouse paired effectively with each other, indicating there is no species barrier to IL-35 dimerization and suggesting a conserved dimerization interface. Specific p35 residues that contribute to formation of the IL-12 interface were assessed for their contribution to the IL-35 interface, and candidate Ebi3 residues were screened for their contribution to both IL-27 and IL-35 interfaces. Several residues were identified as critical to the IL-12 or IL-27 interfaces. Conversely, no single mutation was identified that completely disrupts p35/Ebi3 pairing. Linear alanine scanning mutagenesis on both p35 and Ebi3 subunits was performed, focusing on residues that are conserved between the mouse and human proteins. Additionally, a structure-based alanine-scanning approach in which mutations were clustered based on proximitiy was performed on the p35 subunit. Both approaches suggest that IL-35 has distinct criteria for subunit pairing and is remarkabley less sensitive to structural perturbation than IL-12 and IL-27. Additionally, studies using a panel of anti-p35 and anti-Ebi3 antibodies indicate differential availability of epitopes within IL-12 family members that share these subunits, suggesting that IL-35 has distinct structural features, relative to IL-12 and IL-27. These results may be useful in future directed therapeutic targeting of IL-12 family members.

Abstract:Prognosis of breast cancer patients has been determined traditionally by lymph node status, tumor size, and histologic grade. In recent years the Oncotype DX recurrence score (RS) assay has emerged as an expensive adjunct prognostic tool. Markers of proliferation play a large role in determination of RS, and we have shown previously that immunohistochemical expression of proliferation markers Ki-67 and phosphohistone H3 (PPH3) correlates with RS. Our current goal is comparison of the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) mitotic score, defined by the Nottingham grading system, with anti-PPH3 mitotic figure labeling assessed by both visual and automated image analysis and correlation of mitotic score results with RS. Estrogen receptor-positive breast carcinomas from 137 patients with Oncotype DX testing were selected. A representative H&E-stained tumor section was evaluated. Mitoses were counted per 10 high-power fields and tumors graded using the Nottingham criteria by 1 pathologist in accordance with College of American Pathologists-recommended mitotic count cutoffs for a field diameter of 0.55 mm. An additional section was immunostained with PPH3 antibody. PPH3 mitotic scores were determined visually and by automated imaging system. Statistical analysis was performed using univariate tests and Spearman coefficient. There was a statistically significant positive correlation among the 3 methods of mitotic score assessment. Specifically, correlation of tumor grades obtained using visual and automated methods of assessment of mitotic activity with PPH3 stain was the strongest and most statistically significant (weighted kappa value 0.84, P<0.001; Spearman coefficient 0.89, P<0.001). There was a statistically significant positive correlation between H&E mitosis score and RS (P<0.001, Spearman coefficient 0.30) and between visual PPH3 mitotic score and RS (P<0.001, Spearman coefficient 0.28). In conclusion, mitotic score by any of the 3 methods studied may be useful in assessing tumor grade, proliferation, and prognosis.

Title:Regulation of TH17 cell differentiation by innate immune signals.
Authors:['Huang G', 'Wang Y', 'Chi H']
Affiliation:Department of Immunology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.
Abstract:Upon antigen stimulation, naive T helper cells differentiate into distinct lineages to attain specialized properties and effector functions. T(H)17 cells, a recently identified lineage of CD4(+) effector T cells, play a key role in the immune defense against fungi and extracellular bacteria, but also contribute to the pathogenesis of many autoimmune conditions. The differentiation of T(H)17 cells is orchestrated by an intricate network of signaling pathways and transcriptional regulators in T cells. While the involvement of T cell-intrinsic pathways has been described extensively, we are just beginning to appreciate how T(H)17 cell development is shaped by extrinsic pathways, especially the innate immune signals. Dendritic cells (DCs), the most important cell type to bridge innate and adaptive immunity, drive T(H)17 cell differentiation by providing antigenic, costimulatory and cytokine signals. This is mediated by the recognition of innate and inflammatory signals by DCs via pattern recognition receptors, cytokine receptors and other immunomodulatory receptors that in turn activate the intracellular signaling network. In particular, p38alpha MAP kinase has emerged as a critical pathway to program DC-dependent T(H)17 cell differentiation by integrating multiple instructive signals in DCs. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the mechanisms by which DC-derived innate immune signals drive T(H)17 cell differentiation.

Abstract:UNLABELLED: Exercise has been noted in some, but not all, studies to elicit an oxidative stress. The discrepancy in findings may be related to differences in exercise intensity across protocols, as well as to differences in training status of participants. PURPOSE: We compared blood oxidative stress biomarkers in exercise-trained men after three different bouts of exercise of varying intensity and duration, as well as a nonexercise condition. METHODS: On different days, men (n = 12, 21-35 yr) performed aerobic cycle exercise (60 min at 70% HR reserve) and cycle sprints (five 60-s sprints at 100% maximum wattage obtained during graded exercise testing and ten 15-s sprints at 200% maximum wattage obtained during graded exercise testing). Blood was collected before and 0, 30, and 60 min after exercise and analyzed for malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), advanced oxidation protein products, and nitrate/nitrite (NO(x)). As indicators of antioxidant status, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were measured. RESULTS: No differences were noted in malondialdehyde, H(2)O(2), advanced oxidation protein product, or NO(x) between conditions or across time (P > 0.05). Antioxidant capacity was generally highest at 30 and 60 min after exercise and lowest at 0 min after exercise. CONCLUSIONS: In trained men, and considering the limitations of the current design (e.g., inclusion of selected oxidative stress and antioxidant biomarkers measured in blood only), strenuous bouts of exercise do not result in a significant increase in blood oxidative stress during the 1-h postexercise period. These findings may be related to attenuation in reactive oxygen species production as an adaptation to chronic exercise training and/or a protective effect of the antioxidant system in response to acute strenuous exercise.

Title:Controlled thermoresponsive hydrogels by stereocomplexed PLA-PEG-PLA prepared via hybrid micelles of pre-mixed copolymers with different PEG lengths.
Authors:['Abebe DG', 'Fujiwara T']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, United States.
Abstract:The stereocomplexed hydrogels derived from the micelle mixture of two enantiomeric triblock copolymers, PLLA-PEG-PLLA and PDLA-PEG-PDLA, reported in 2001 exhibited sol-to-gel transition at approximately body temperature upon heating. However, the showed poor storage modulus (ca. 1000 Pa) determined their insufficiency as injectable implant biomaterials for many applications. In this study, the mechanical property of these hydrogels was significantly improved by the modifications of molecular weights and micelle structure. Co-micelles composed of block copolymers with two sizes of PEG block length were shown to possess unique and dissimilar properties from the micelles composed of single-sized block copolymers. The stereomixture of PLA-PEG-PLA comicelles showed a controllable sol-to-gel transition at a wide temperature range of 4 and 80 degrees C. The sol-gel phase diagram displays a linear relationship of temperature versus copolymer composition; hence, a transition at body temperature can be readily achieved by adjusting the mixed copolymer ratio. The resulting thermoresponsive hydrogels exhibit a storage modulus notably higher (ca. 6000 Pa) than that of previously reported hydrogels. As a physical network solely governed by self-reorganization of micelles, followed by stereocomplexation, this unique system offers practical, safe, and simple implantable biomaterials.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Smoking and nicotine dependence (ND) are prevalent among substance abusers but little is known about characteristics of ND in this population. This information would help identify those most in need of smoking cessation programs. This study evaluated the associations of socio-demographic, tobacco- and substance use-related, and health/mental health factors to ND in adults receiving publicly funded substance abuse treatment in Tennessee. METHODS: All Tennessee residents who received federal block grant-funded substance abuse treatment during July-December, 2004 were invited to participate in a 6 month post-intake telephone follow-up interview. Socio-demographic characteristics, perceived health and mental health, tobacco use history and patterns, and ND, assessed by the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND), were obtained at follow-up. Alcohol and illicit drug use and smoking status prior to treatment were assessed at intake. This paper analyzes data for 855 clients who were current cigarette smokers at both intake and follow-up. RESULTS: Sixty three percent of smokers were ND (FTND score >/= 4). Correlates of ND included older age, poorer self-rated overall health, earlier age of onset of cigarette smoking and substance abuse, fewer smoking quit attempts in past year, single substance use (alcohol or illicit drug, vs. multiple substances) at intake, use of opiates/narcotics and sedatives, and past month self-reported depression. CONCLUSION: ND was highly prevalent and correlated with specific types and patterns of substance abuse and depression. These results suggest that intensive smoking cessation interventions, involving behavioral support, pharmacotherapy, and mood management, are needed to effectively assist this population.

Abstract:To define the interaction of novel secosteroids produced by the action of cytochrome P450scc with vitamin D receptor (VDR), we used a human melanoma line overexpressing VDR fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and tested the ligand induced translocation of VDR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Hydroxyderivatives of vitamin D(3) with a full length (D(3)) side chain and hydroxy-secosteroids with a shortened side chain (pD) stimulated VDR translocation and inhibited proliferation, however, with different potencies. In general the D(3) were more potent than pD analogues. Molecular modeling of the binding of the secosteroids to the VDR genomic binding pocket (G-pocket) correlated well with the experimental data for VDR translocation. In contrast, docking scores for the non-genomic binding site of the VDR were poor. In conclusion, both the length of the side chain and the number and position of hydroxyl groups affect the activation of VDR by novel secosteroids.

Title:The histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation pathway is regulated by target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling and functions directly in ribosomal RNA biogenesis.

Affiliation:Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Center for Adult Cancer Research, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN 38163, USA.
Abstract:Epigenetic changes in chromatin through histone post-translational modifications are essential for altering gene transcription in response to environmental cues. How histone modifications are regulated by environmental stimuli remains poorly understood yet this process is critical for delineating how epigenetic pathways are influenced by the cellular environment. We have used the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway, which transmits environmental nutrient signals to control cell growth, as a model to delineate mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. A chemical genomics screen using the TOR inhibitor rapamycin against a histone H3/H4 mutant library identified histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation (H3K56ac) as a chromatin modification regulated by TOR signaling. We demonstrate this acetylation pathway functions in TOR-dependent cell growth in part by contributing directly to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis. Specifically, H3K56ac creates a chromatin environment permissive to RNA polymerase I transcription and nascent rRNA processing by regulating binding of the high mobility group protein Hmo1 and the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) processome complex. Overall, these studies identify a novel chromatin regulatory role for TOR signaling and support a specific function for H3K56ac in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene transcription and nascent rRNA processing essential for cell growth.

Title:Implications of high-frequency cochlear dead regions for fitting hearing aids to adults with mild to moderately severe hearing loss.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Johnson JA', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. robyncox@memphis.edu
Abstract:OBJECTIVES: A cochlear dead region (DR) occurs at a given frequency when there is a loss of normal functioning of inner hair cells tuned to that frequency. It has been suggested that existence of high-frequency DRs has implications for hearing aid fitting, and that the optimal amount of high-frequency gain is reduced for these patients. However, the data supporting this suggestion has been obtained using listeners with severe or profound hearing loss. It is uncertain whether these results would apply for listeners with the mild to moderately severe hearing loss that is more typical of hearing aid users. This investigation used laboratory and field measurements to examine the effects of reduced high-frequency gain in typical hearing aid users with high-frequency DRs compared with matched users without DRs. DESIGN: The study was a double-blinded, nonrandomized intervention design with 18 matched pairs of adult subjects. In each pair, one subject had high-frequency DRs (usually at one or two test frequencies) and the other subject had no DR. Each subject was fitted unilaterally with a hearing aid having two active programs. One program used a National Acoustics Laboratories (NAL) prescription target for average speech (NAL condition). The other program was identical to NAL except for reduced gain in the high frequencies (low-pass [LP] condition). Outcomes included aided speech recognition in quiet and noise measured in the laboratory, ratings of speech understanding in daily life, and final preference for the NAL or LP program. RESULTS: In laboratory testing, speech recognition in quiet was significantly better when using the NAL program. This result was seen for subjects with DRs and without DRs. When listening in noise, speech recognition was significantly better when using the NAL program for subjects without DRs. For subjects with DRs, results were equivalent for the NAL and LP programs. In daily life, the NAL program received significantly higher ratings for speech understanding, and this result was seen for subjects with and without DRs. When asked about their preference for using the NAL or LP program in daily life, subjects did not always choose the program they had rated as giving better speech understanding, but their preference was not associated with having DRs. About one-third of subjects preferred the LP program. The reason most frequently given for preferring the LP program was that the NAL was too loud. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, adult hearing aid wearers with mild to moderately severe hearing loss benefitted from high-frequency gain whether or not they had DRs. In laboratory testing, but not in daily life, subjects with DRs tended to obtain less benefit than those without DRs. However, provision of NAL high-frequency gain never resulted in poorer performance in either group. These results suggest that identification of high-frequency DRs at one or two frequencies does not call for any a priori modification of the target hearing aid prescription for listeners with mild to moderately severe hearing loss.

Title:Nucleus pulposus replacement and regeneration/repair technologies: present status and future prospects.

Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. glewis@memphis.edu
Abstract:Degenerative disc disease is implicated in the pathogenesis of many painful conditions of the back, chief among which is low back pain. Acute and/or chronic low back pain (A/CLBP) afflicts a large number of people, thus making it a major healthcare issue with concomitant cost ramifications. When conservative treatments for A/CLBP, such as bed rest, anti-inflammatory medications, and physical therapy, prove to be ineffectual, surgical options are recommended. The most popular of these is discectomy followed by fusion. Although there are many reports of good to excellent outcomes with this method, there are concerns, such as long-term adverse biomechanical consequences to adjacent functional spinal unit(s). A surgical option that has been attracting much attention recently is replacement or regeneration/repair of the nucleus pulposus, an approach that holds the prospect of not compromising either mobility or function and causing no adjacent-level injury. There is a sizeable body of literature highlighting this option, comprising in vitro biomechanical studies, finite element analyses, animal-model studies, and limited clinical evaluations. This work is a review of this body of literature and is organized into four parts, with the focus being on replacement technologies, regeneration/repair technologies, and detailed expositions on 14 areas for future study. This review ends with a summary of the salient points made.

Abstract:Inadequate knowledge of family health history (FHH) continues to be a major obstacle limiting its usefulness in public health and clinical practice; strategies to facilitate FHH dissemination are needed. Data (N = 1,334) were obtained through waiting-room surveys completed by a diverse sample of patients attending three community health centers. Perceptions about the importance of genetic information (beta = 0.13, p < 0.001; beta = 0.11, p < 0.001) and higher genetic self-efficacy (beta = 0.14, p < 0.001; beta = 0.23, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with higher levels of perceived familiarity with and importance of FHH, respectively. Furthermore, beliefs about genetic causation of illnesses (beta = 0.12, p < 0.001) and a wider reach of health communication within one's family (beta = 0.15, p < 0.001) were associated with higher levels of perceived familiarity with one's FHH. Participants in the oldest group (>50 years) reported higher familiarity than those in the youngest (18-25 years). Those with higher familiarity were significantly less likely to answer "don't know" when reporting diabetes and heart disease diagnoses among immediate (OR = 0.35 and OR = 0.29, respectively) and extended (OR = 0.50 and OR = 0.46, respectively) family members. Having a wider health communication reach within a family may be beneficial in increasing familiarity with FHH; however, the reported levels of communication reach were limited among most participants. Women, older-generation family members, and those who believe in the importance of genetics in health or feel confident about using genetic information may be particularly important as targets of public health interventions to facilitate FHH dissemination within families.

Title:Cis-2-decenoic acid inhibits S. aureus growth and biofilm in vitro: a pilot study.
Authors:['Jennings JA', 'Courtney HS', 'Haggard WO']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA, jjnnings@memphis.edu.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Cis-2 decenoic acid (C2DA) disperses biofilm in many strains of microorganisms. However, whether C2DA inhibits bacterial growth or has potential to boost the actions of antibiotics is unknown. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked whether (1) C2DA inhibited MRSA growth and biofilm, (2) antibiotics increased inhibitory effects, (3) inhibitory concentrations of C2DA were cytotoxic to human cells, and (4) effective concentrations could be delivered from a chitosan sponge drug delivery device. METHODS: Broth containing seven concentrations of C2DA and six concentrations of either daptomycin, vancomycin, or linezolid was inoculated with a clinical isolate of MRSA and added to a total of 504 coated microtiter plate wells in triplicate (n = 3) for turbidity bacterial growth and crystal violet biofilm mass quantification. We used fibroblast cell viability assays of six C2DA concentrations (n = 4) to evaluate preliminary biocompatibility. We measured the elution of C2DA from a chitosan sponge drug delivery device with two representative loading concentrations (n = 3). RESULTS: C2DA at concentrations of 500 mug/mL and above inhibited growth, while 125 mug/mL C2DA inhibited biofilm. Combination with antibiotics increased these effects. At concentrations up to 500 mug/mL, there were no cytotoxic effects on fibroblasts. Chitosan sponges loaded with 100 mg of C2DA eluted concentrations at or above biofilm-inhibitory concentrations for 5 days. CONCLUSIONS: C2DA inhibited biofilm formation by MRSA at biocompatible concentrations, with increasing biofilm reduction with added antibiotics. Elution of C2DA from a chitosan sponge can be modified through adjusting loading concentration. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: By inhibiting biofilm formation on implant surfaces, C2DA may reduce the number of infections in musculoskeletal trauma.

Abstract:A clinical need continues for consistent bone remodeling within problematic sites such as those of fracture nonunion, avascular necrosis, or irregular bone formations. In attempt to address such needs, a biomaterial system is proposed to induce early inflammatory responses after implantation and to provide later osteoconductive scaffolding for bone regeneration. Biomaterial-induced inflammation would parallel the early stage of hematoma-induced fracture repair and allow scaffold-promoted remodeling of osseous tissue to a healthy state. Initiation of the wound healing cascade by two human concentrated platelet releasate-containing alginate/beta-tricalcium phosphate biocomposites has been studied in vitro using the TIB-71 RAW264.7 mouse monocyte cell line. Inflammatory responses inherent to the base material were found and could be modulated through incorporation of platelet releasate. Differences in hydrogel wt% (2 vs. 8 %) and/or calcium phosphate granule vol.% (20 vs. 10 %) allowed for tuning the response associated with platelet releasate-associated growth factor elution. Tunability from completely suppressing the inflammatory response to augmenting the response was observed through varied elution profiles of both releasate-derived bioagents and impurities inherent to alginate. A 2.5-fold upregulation of inducible-nitric oxide synthase gene expression followed by a tenfold increase in nitrite media levels was induced by inclusion of releasate within the 8 wt%/10 vol.% formulation and was comparable to an endotoxin positive control. Whereas, near complete elimination of inflammation was seen when releasate was included within the 2 wt%/20 vol.% formulation. These in vitro results suggested tunable interactions between the multiple platelet releasate-derived bioagents and the biocomposites for enhancing hematoma-like fracture repair. Additionally, minimally invasive delivery for in situ curing of the implant system via injection was demonstrated in rat tail vertebrae using microcomputed tomography.

Title:The role of caregiver burden in understanding African American custodial grandmothers.
Authors:['Carr GF', 'Hayslip B Jr', 'Gray J']
Affiliation:Loewenberg School of Nursing, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:African American grandmothers who parent their grandchildren often experience burden and altered health related to these responsibilities. However, little is known about how such burden reliably predicts physical and mental health, needs for information about services, needs for service and service use. Recruited from churches and community centers, 93 African American grandmothers who provided care for their grandchildren participated in this study. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to ascertain relationships between variables. Findings suggested that burden predicted needs for information about services, needs for service, service use, and physical health, but not mental health. In order to better understand grandmother caregivers' well-being and orientation to services, the present study suggests that the role of burden be centralized as a predictor of many parameters pertinent to grandparents raising their grandchildren.

Abstract:As a continuation of our efforts to discover and develop small molecules as anticancer agents, we identified GRI-394837 as an initial hit from similarity search on RGD and its analogs. Based on GRI-394837, we designed and synthesized a focused set of novel chromenes (4a-e) in a single step using microwave method. All five compounds showed activity in the nanomolar range (IC(50): 7.4-640 nM) in two melanoma, three prostate and four glioma cancer cell lines. The chromene 4e is active against all the cell lines and particularly against the A172 human glioma cell line (IC(50): 7.4 nM). Interestingly, in vitro tubulin polymerization assay shows 4e to be a weak tubulin polymerization inhibitor but it shows very strong cytotoxicity in cellular assays, therefore there must be additional unknown mechanism(s) for the anticancer activity. Additionally, the strong antiproliferative activity was verified by one of the selected chromene (4a) by the NCI 60 cell line screen. These results strongly suggest that the novel chromenes could be further developed as a potential therapeutic agent for a variety of aggressive cancers.

Title:Risk screening for ADHD in a college population: is there a relationship with academic performance?
Authors:['Burlison JD', 'Dwyer WO']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA. jdburlsn@memphis.edu
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: The present study examines the relationship between self-reported levels of ADHD and academic outcomes, as well as aptitude. METHOD: A total of 523 college students took the Adult Self-Report Scale-Version 1.1 (ASRS-V1.1), and their scores were compared with course performance and ACT (American College Test) composite scores. RESULTS: The measure identified 70 students (13.4%) as being in the "highly likely" category for an ADHD diagnosis. Course exam and ACT scores for the 70 "highly likely" students were statistically identical to the remaining 453 students in the sample and the 77 students identified as "highly unlikely" as well. Only 4 of the "highly likely" 70 students were registered with the university's Office of Student Disability Services as having been diagnosed with ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: The ASRS-V1.1 failed to discriminate academic performance and aptitude differences between ADHD "highly likely" and "highly unlikely" individuals. The use of self-report screeners of ADHD is questioned in contexts relating ADHD to academic performance.

Affiliation:Dept. of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Implants of Epon, inserted in Dermacentor variabilis (Say) through incisions in the cuticle, were encapsulated by hemocytes. We followed this process at intervals of 1,3,6, 12 and 24 h, and every 24 h thereafter up to 120 h. Degranulation of Type 1 granulocytes and coagulation of hemolymph were first seen at 1 h after implantation and were the earliest evidence of encapsulation. By 3 h after implantation, the degranulation and disintegration of granulocytes had formed a matrix at the Epon surface. From 6 h until encapsulation was completed, plasmatocytes and granulocytes continued to respond to degranulation and formed multiple cell layers around the Epon implant. The capsule was complete at 72 h after implantation. Completion was marked by decreasing degranulation, migration of hemocytes from the outermost layers of the capsule, and by the appearance of loosely attached hemocytes on the outer surface of the capsule. The most common junctional complex observed was gap junctions.

Abstract:The bile salt export pump (BSEP) is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that serves as the primary system for removing bile salts from the liver. In humans, deficiency of BSEP, which is encoded by the ABCB11 gene, causes severe progressive cholestatic liver disease from early infancy. In previous studies of Abcb11 deficiency in mice generated on a mixed genetic background, the animals did not recapitulate the human disease. We reasoned that ABCB11 deficiency may cause unique changes in hepatic metabolism that are predictive of liver injury. To test this possibility, we first determined that Abcb11 knock-out (KO) C57BL/6J mice recapitulate human deficiency. Before the onset of cholestasis, Abcb11 KO mice have altered hepatic lipid metabolism coupled with reduced expression of genes important in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. This was associated with increased serum free-fatty acids, reduced total white adipose, and marked impairment of long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation. Importantly, metabolomic analysis confirmed that Abcb11 KO mice have impaired mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation with the elevated fatty acid metabolites phenylpropionylglycine and phenylacetylglycine. These metabolic changes precede cholestasis but may be of relevance to cholestatic disease progression because altered fatty acid metabolism can enhance reactive oxygen species that might exacerbate cholestatic liver damage.

Abstract:Metabolic and neurological responses to 4 bouts of lower-body or upper-body resistance exercise preceded by cycle ergometry or rest were assessed. Nine resistance-trained men (26.7 +/- 6.6 years) underwent bouts of (a) cycle ergometry then bench press, (b) bench press only, (c) cycle ergometry then back squat, and (d) back squat only. Cycle ergometry was performed at 75% maximum heart rate for 45 minutes. Bench press and back squat protocols required 6 sets to volitional fatigue at 80% 1RM with 2 minutes rest between sets. Significantly more repetitions were performed during set 1 for back squat without preceding aerobic exercise (12.6 +/- 4.5 vs. 10.0 +/- 3.5, p = 0.000) and cumulatively at set 3 (27.1 +/- 10.6 vs. 23.1 +/- 9.2, p = 0.014), and no differences were noted for bench press repetitions. Inclusion of cycle ergometry results in impaired back squat, but not bench press, performance likely because of a combination of local metabolic stress and various neuromuscular effects.

Abstract:Behavioral treatments (predominantly biofeedback, relaxation, and cognitive-behavioral) have been utilized in headache management for many decades. Although effective, they have not been as widely implemented as desired, chiefly due to their time-intensive nature, special therapist qualifications, and patient costs. This paper focuses on ways to make these treatments more affordable and more readily accessible to patients. Various alternative delivery models have been explored. This paper reviews progress to date on three such approaches for treating recurrent headaches in adults--prudent limited office contact, Internet delivery, and mass media approaches. Clinical outcomes, advantages, and disadvantages of these approaches are reviewed in brief.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: The efficiencies of the stop codons TAA, TAG, and TGA in protein synthesis termination are not the same. These variations could allow many genes to be regulated. There are many similar nucleotide trimers found on the second and third reading-frames of a gene. They are called premature stop codons (PSC). Like stop codons, the PSC in bacterial genomes are also highly bias in terms of their quantities and qualities on the genes. Phylogenetically related species often share a similar PSC profile. We want to know whether the selective forces that influence the stop codons and the PSC usage biases in a genome are related. We also wish to know how strong these trimers in a genome are related to the natural history of the bacterium. Knowing these relations may provide better knowledge in the phylogeny of bacteria RESULTS: A 16SrRNA-alignment tree of 19 well-studied alpha-, beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria Type species is used as standard reference for bacterial phylogeny. The genomes of sixty-one bacteria, belonging to the alpha-, beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria subphyla, are used for this study. The stop codons and PSC are collectively termed "Translation Stop Signals" (TSS). A gene is represented by nine scalars corresponding to the numbers of counts of TAA, TAG, and TGA on each of the three reading-frames of that gene. "Translation Stop Signals Ratio" (TSSR) is the ratio between the TSS counts. Four types of TSSR are investigated. The TSSR-1, TSSR-2 and TSSR-3 are each a 3-scalar series corresponding respectively to the average ratio of TAA: TAG: TGA on the first, second, and third reading-frames of all genes in a genome. The Genomic-TSSR is a 9-scalar series representing the ratio of distribution of all TSS on the three reading-frames of all genes in a genome. Results show that bacteria grouped by their similarities based on TSSR-1, TSSR-2, or TSSR-3 values could only partially resolve the phylogeny of the species. However, grouping bacteria based on thier Genomic-TSSR values resulted in clusters of bacteria identical to those bacterial clusters of the reference tree. Unlike the 16SrRNA method, the Genomic-TSSR tree is also able to separate closely related species/strains at high resolution. Species and strains separated by the Genomic-TSSR grouping method are often in good agreement with those classified by other taxonomic methods. Correspondence analysis of individual genes shows that most genes in a bacterial genome share a similar TSSR value. However, within a chromosome, the Genic-TSSR values of genes near the replication origin region (Ori) are more similar to each other than those genes near the terminus region (Ter). CONCLUSION: The translation stop signals on the three reading-frames of the genes on a bacterial genome are interrelated, possibly due to frequent off-frame recombination facilitated by translational-associated recombination (TSR). However, TSR may not occur randomly in a bacterial chromosome. Genes near the Ori region are often highly expressed and a bacterium always maintains multiple copies of Ori. Frequent collisions between DNA- polymerase and RNA-polymerase would create many DNA strand-breaks on the genes; whereas DNA strand-break induced homologues-recombination is more likely to take place between genes with similar sequence. Thus, localized recombination could explain why the TSSR of genes near the Ori region are more similar to each other. The quantity and quality of these TSS in a genome strongly reflect the natural history of a bacterium. We propose that the Genomic- TSSR can be used as a subjective biomarker to represent the phyletic status of a bacterium.

Abstract:INTRODUCTION: Pathologic examination of mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) after resection of non-small-cell lung cancer is critical in the determination of prognosis and postoperative management. Although systematic nodal dissection is recommended, the quality of pathologic lymph-node staging often falls short of recommendations in practice. We tested the feasibility of improving pathologic lymph-node staging of resectable non-small-cell lung cancer by using a prelabeled specimen-collection kit. METHODS: Case-control study with comparison of 51 resections, using a special lymph-node collection kit, with 51 controls matched for surgeon, extent of resection, pathologist, and T category. Appropriate statistical methods were used for all comparisons. RESULTS: The median number of MLNs examined increased from one in the control group, to six in the case group (p < 0.001). The percentage of resections attaining the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-recommended quality of MLN examination, and the proportion that would have been eligible for recent landmark postresection adjuvant therapy trials increased significantly (p < 0.001). The duration of surgery and postoperative complication rates were similar between cases and controls. Eighteen percent of kit cases had positive MLN, compared with 8% of controls. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a specialized specimen-collection kit for MLN examination was feasible, markedly improved MLN staging, and showed a trend toward increased detection of patients with MLN metastasis, with only a modest increase in duration of surgery, and no increase in perioperative morbidity, mortality, or hospital length of stay.

Title:A computational investigation on the connection between dynamics properties of ribosomal proteins and ribosome assembly.

Abstract:Assembly of the ribosome from its protein and RNA constituents has been studied extensively over the past 50 years, and experimental evidence suggests that prokaryotic ribosomal proteins undergo conformational changes during assembly. However, to date, no studies have attempted to elucidate these conformational changes. The present work utilizes computational methods to analyze protein dynamics and to investigate the linkage between dynamics and binding of these proteins during the assembly of the ribosome. Ribosomal proteins are known to be positively charged and we find the percentage of positive residues in r-proteins to be about twice that of the average protein: Lys+Arg is 18.7% for E. coli and 21.2% for T. thermophilus. Also, positive residues constitute a large proportion of RNA contacting residues: 39% for E. coli and 46% for T. thermophilus. This affirms the known importance of charge-charge interactions in the assembly of the ribosome. We studied the dynamics of three primary proteins from E. coli and T. thermophilus 30S subunits that bind early in the assembly (S15, S17, and S20) with atomic molecular dynamic simulations, followed by a study of all r-proteins using elastic network models. Molecular dynamics simulations show that solvent-exposed proteins (S15 and S17) tend to adopt more stable solution conformations than an RNA-embedded protein (S20). We also find protein residues that contact the 16S rRNA are generally more mobile in comparison with the other residues. This is because there is a larger proportion of contacting residues located in flexible loop regions. By the use of elastic network models, which are computationally more efficient, we show that this trend holds for most of the 30S r-proteins.

Abstract:As life expectancy increases for adolescents ever diagnosed with AIDS due to treatment advances, the optimum timing of advance care planning is unclear. Left unprepared for end-of-life (EOL) decisions, families may encounter miscommunication and disagreements, resulting in families being charged with neglect, court battles and even legislative intervention. Advanced care planning (ACP) is a valuable tool rarely used with adolescents. The Longitudinal Pediatric Palliative Care: Quality of Life & Spiritual Struggle study is a two-arm, randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of a disease specific FAmily CEntered (FACE) advanced care planning intervention model among adolescents diagnosed with AIDS, aimed at relieving psychological, spiritual, and physical suffering, while maximizing quality of life through facilitated conversations about ACP. Participants will include 130 eligible dyads (adolescent and family decision-maker) from four urban cities in the United States, randomized to either the FACE intervention or a Healthy Living Control. Three 60-minute sessions will be conducted at weekly intervals. The dyads will be assessed at baseline as well as 3-, 6-, 12-, and 18-month post-intervention. The primary outcome measures will be in congruence with EOL treatment preferences, decisional conflict, and quality of communication. The mediating and moderating effects of threat appraisal, HAART adherence, and spiritual struggle on the relationships among FACE and quality of life and hospitalization/dialysis use will also be assessed. This study will be the first longitudinal study of an AIDS-specific model of ACP with adolescents. If successful, this intervention could quickly translate into clinical practice.

Abstract:PURPOSE: The aims of this study are to compare self-reported sleep quality in adult survivors of childhood brain tumors and a population-based comparison group, to identify treatment-related factors associated with sleep disturbances, and to identify the impact of post-treatment obesity and depression on sleep scores in adult survivors of childhood brain tumors. METHODS: Randomly selected adult survivors of childhood brain tumors (n = 78) and age-, sex-, and zip code-matched population-group members (n = 78) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Brief Symptom Inventory. Sleep quality and the effect of demographic, treatment, and post-treatment characteristics were evaluated with linear and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Brain tumor survivors were 2.7 (95% CI, 1.1, 6.5) times more likely than the comparison group to take greater than 30 min to fall asleep. Females in both groups reported worse sleep quality and impaired daytime functioning. Among survivors, post-treatment obesity was associated with daytime dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These results agree with previous studies associating sleep, sex, and obesity and identified longer sleep latency as being a problem among childhood brain tumor survivors. Further study identifying factors contributing to sleep latency, and its impact on quality of life among adult survivors of childhood brain tumors is needed.

Abstract:Circadian clocks in mammals are based on a negative feedback loop in which transcriptional repression by the cryptochromes, CRY1 and CRY2, lies at the heart of the mechanism. Despite similarities in sequence, domain structure, and biochemical activity, they play distinct roles in clock function. However, detailed biochemical studies have not been straightforward and Cry function has not been examined in real clock cells using kinetic measurements. In this study, we demonstrate, through cell-based genetic complementation and real-time molecular recording, that Cry1 alone is able to maintain cell-autonomous circadian rhythms, whereas Cry2 cannot. Using this novel functional assay, we identify a cryptochrome differentiating alpha-helical domain within the photolyase homology region (PHR) of CRY1, designated as CRY1-PHR(313-426), that is required for clock function and distinguishes CRY1 from CRY2. Contrary to speculation, the divergent carboxyl-terminal tail domain (CTD) is dispensable, but serves to modulate rhythm amplitude and period length. Finally, we identify the biochemical basis of their distinct function; CRY1 is a much more potent transcriptional repressor than CRY2, and the strength of repression by various forms of CRY proteins significantly correlates with rhythm amplitude. Taken together, our results demonstrate that CRY1-PHR(313-426), not the divergent CTD, is critical for clock function. These findings provide novel insights into the evolution of the diverse functions of the photolyase/cryptochrome family of flavoproteins and offer new opportunities for mechanistic studies of CRY function.

Abstract:Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is a surgical technique used to direct the formation of bone in the graft space by protecting it with a barrier membrane used to exclude soft tissues during healing. Chitosan has been advocated for GTR applications because of its biocompatibility, degradability, wound healing, and osteogenic properties. In this study, electrospun chitosan membranes, crosslinked with 5 mM or 10 mM geinipin, a natural crosslinker extracted from the gardenia plant, were evaluated for suture pullout strength, crystallinity, and cytocompatibility with normal human dermal fibroblast and TIB 71 RAW 264.7 monocyte cells. Ultimate suture pullout strength was significantly lower (51-67%) than that of commercially available collagen membranes. Crystallinity of the electrospun chitosan mats decreased upon crosslinking by 14-17% (p = 0.013). The molecular weight of the chitosan polymer was decreased by 75% during the electrospinning process. Uncrosslinked and genipin-crosslinked chitosan mats were cytocompatible and supported fibroblast cell proliferation for 9 days. Uncrosslinked and genipin-crosslinked membranes did not activate monocytes to produce nitric oxide (NO) in vitro in the absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Finally, chitosan membranes inhibited LPS-induced NO production of RAW 264.7 cells by 59-67% as compared to tissue culture plastic and collagen membrane. Improvements are needed in the tear strength of electrospun chitosan membranes for clinical application.

Abstract:An Oxyma derivative, (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl 2-cyano-2-(hydroxyimino)acetate (2), displayed remarkable physicochemical properties as a peptide-coupling additive for peptide-forming reactions in water. Short peptides to oligopeptides could be synthesized by using 2, EDCI, and NaHCO(3) in water without measurable racemization. Significantly, a simple basic and acidic aqueous workup procedure can remove all reagents utilized in the reactions to afford only coupling products in consistently excellent yields.

Abstract:PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Wild relatives of crop species have long been viewed as an important genetic resource for crop improvement, but basic information about the population biology of these species is often lacking. This study investigated the population structure, demographic history, and evolutionary patterns of a green-fruited relative of the cultivated tomato, Solanum peruvianum. METHODS: We investigated spatial genetics of S. peruvianum and screened for loci potentially under natural selection by integrating amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotypes, phenotypic data, geography, and geographic information system (GIS)-derived climate data of 19 natural populations. KEY RESULTS: Solanum peruvianum had a moderate degree of population differentiation, likely reflecting partial geographic isolation between species. Populations had a distribution pattern consistent with north-to-south "stepping-stone" dispersal with significant isolation by distance (IBD), similar to other tomato species. Several AFLP loci showed evidence of selection and associated with climate variables. However, phenotypic traits generally did not correlate with climate variables. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic features of the coastal Andes is likely an important factor that determines the migration pattern and population structure of S. peruvianum, but climatic factors do not appear to be critical for its phenotypic evolution, perhaps due to a high degree of phenotypic plasticity. Spatial genetics of wild relatives of crop species is a powerful approach to understand their evolutionary patterns and to accelerate the discovery of their potential for crop improvements.

Abstract:Medulloblastoma is a malignant childhood brain tumour comprising four discrete subgroups. Here, to identify mutations that drive medulloblastoma, we sequenced the entire genomes of 37 tumours and matched normal blood. One-hundred and thirty-six genes harbouring somatic mutations in this discovery set were sequenced in an additional 56 medulloblastomas. Recurrent mutations were detected in 41 genes not yet implicated in medulloblastoma; several target distinct components of the epigenetic machinery in different disease subgroups, such as regulators of H3K27 and H3K4 trimethylation in subgroups 3 and 4 (for example, KDM6A and ZMYM3), and CTNNB1-associated chromatin re-modellers in WNT-subgroup tumours (for example, SMARCA4 and CREBBP). Modelling of mutations in mouse lower rhombic lip progenitors that generate WNT-subgroup tumours identified genes that maintain this cell lineage (DDX3X), as well as mutated genes that initiate (CDH1) or cooperate (PIK3CA) in tumorigenesis. These data provide important new insights into the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma subgroups and highlight targets for therapeutic development.

Title:The impact of conversational acknowledgers on perceptions of psychotherapists.
Authors:['Battles MB', 'Berman JS']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Memphis, USA.
Abstract:During conversations, individuals often signal that they are paying attention by the use of verbal and nonverbal cues. This study examined these conversational acknowledgers in psychotherapy and evaluated the effects of therapists varying levels of two specific actions-short utterances and nodding-on perceptions of the therapist. A series of brief psychotherapy videos with therapists displaying different levels of the two types of acknowledgers were presented to 320 participants recruited both online and from a university campus. Analysis indicated that when therapists used high levels of both verbal acknowledgers and nodding or when they refrained from using both types of acknowledgers, therapist empathy and therapeutic alliance were perceived as greater than when therapists engaged in one type of acknowledger but not the other.

Abstract:CONTEXT: For youths with life-limiting conditions, little is known regarding families' understanding of their adolescent's wishes for end-of-life (EOL) care. OBJECTIVES: To examine congruence in HIV positive adolescents and their families' thoughts about death and dying. METHODS: The Lyon Advance Care Planning Survey-Adolescent and Surrogate versions were administered within a randomized controlled trial. Participants (n=48) were medically stable adolescents aged 14-21 years with HIV/AIDS and their families. Congruence was measured by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for continuous variables and by kappa for ordinal or dichotomous responses. RESULTS: Adolescent participants were as follows: mean age 16.6 years (range 14-21); 37.5% males; 92% African American; 38% CD4 count <200; and viral load mean=32,079 copies/mL (range <400-91,863 copies/mL). Adolescent/family dyads agreed that it is important to complete an advance directive to let loved ones know their wishes (21/24 dyads), yet no dyads agreed an advance directive had been completed. Dyads endorsed incongruent thoughts about the adolescent being afraid of dying in pain (64%; congruent afraid=8 dyads, kappa=-0.0769) and being off life support machines (congruent important=9 dyads, ICC=-0.133, 95% confidence interval = -0.540, 0.302, P=0.721). Families' knowledge of teens' preferences for the timing of EOL conversations (early vs. late in course of illness) was poor (kappa=-0.1186). Adolescents (90%) wanted to talk about EOL issues before they entered the dying phase. CONCLUSION: Although important areas of congruence emerged, equally important areas, such as the timing of these conversations and adolescents' EOL needs and wishes, are not known by their families. Families need help initiating conversations to assure that their adolescents' EOL wishes are known to them.

Abstract:This study compared the gait of 10 subjects with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction to a group of 12 height- and weight-matched control subjects. The analysis was based on knee flexion, adduction, and internal rotation angles and moments. The objective was to use principal component analysis (PCA) to identify knees of the ACL reconstructed subjects that fell outside normal ranges as determined by control subjects. Gait data were collected on all subjects in a motion analysis laboratory. Principal component (PC) models were developed for each gait measure based on the control subjects' data and used to assess gait waveforms of ACL reconstructed subjects. PCA allows analysis of entire gait waveforms for comparisons. In a sample of 10 ACL reconstructed subjects (7 years after surgery, on average), six of the ACL reconstructed knees had not returned to normal following surgery and eight of the contralateral knees functioned differently from controls. A majority of the differences were noted to occur in the abduction-adduction knee moment with corresponding infrequency in the differences seen in abduction-adduction rotation. PCA enabled us to identify subjects with abnormal gait waveforms as outliers relative to the normal control group.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Impaired sleep quality is commonplace within industrialized societies, as evidenced by the increasing number of prescription sleep aids available. Certain herbal preparations have been suggested to provide a natural benefit to sleep; however, limited controlled data are available documenting this benefit. In the present study we tested the effect of an experimental dietary supplement, containing the active ingredients Chlorophytum borivilianum and Velvet bean, on sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). METHODS: Eighteen healthy and active men and women, with evidence of impaired sleep quality, consumed the supplement daily for 28 days. The PSQI was administered before and after the intervention period. As indicators of safety, resting heart rate and blood pressure were measured, and a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and lipid panel were determined. RESULTS: Sleep quality was influenced by the supplement, as evidenced by an improvement in every category of the PSQI questionnaire (P < 0.05), with most category scores improving approximately 50% from pre to post intervention. No adverse outcomes were noted with use of the supplement, as indicated by no change in resting heart rate, blood pressure, or any bloodborne parameter. CONCLUSIONS: An investigational dietary supplement containing the active ingredients Chlorophytum borivilianum and Velvet bean improves sleep quality in men and women. Additional placebo controlled trials are needed to corroborate these findings in individuals with self-reported sleeping difficulty.

Abstract:Novel ABI-III compounds were designed and synthesized based on our previously reported ABI-I and ABI-II analogues. ABI-III compounds are highly potent against a panel of melanoma and prostate cancer cell lines, with the best compound having an average IC(50) value of 3.8 nM. They are not substrate of Pgp and thus may effectively overcome Pgp-mediated multidrug resistance. ABI-III analogues maintain their mechanisms of action by inhibition of tubulin polymerization.

Abstract:Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) play important roles in gene regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Thus far, no sRNA has been assigned a definitive role in virulence in the major human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae. Based on the potential coding capacity of intergenic regions, we hypothesized that the pneumococcus produces many sRNAs and that they would play an important role in pathogenesis. We describe the application of whole-genome transcriptional sequencing to systematically identify the sRNAs of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Using this approach, we have identified 89 putative sRNAs, 56 of which are newly identified. Furthermore, using targeted genetic approaches and Tn-seq transposon screening, we demonstrate that many of the identified sRNAs have important global and niche-specific roles in virulence. These data constitute the most comprehensive analysis of pneumococcal sRNAs and provide the first evidence of the extensive roles of sRNAs in pneumococcal pathogenesis.

Title:Deployment risk factors and postdeployment health profiles associated with traumatic brain injury in heavy drinking veterans.
Authors:['Williams JL', 'McDevitt-Murphy ME', 'Murphy JG', 'Crouse EM']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, 202 Psychology Building, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Along with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is considered one of the "signature wounds" of combat operations in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom [OIF]) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom [OEF]), but the role of mTBI in the clinical profiles of Veterans with other comorbid forms of post-deployment psychopathology is poorly understood. The current study explored the deployment risk and postdeployment health profiles of heavy drinking OIF and OEF Veterans as a function of mTBI. Sixty-nine heavy-drinking OIF/OEF Veterans were recruited through a Veterans' Affairs Medical Center and completed questionnaires and structured interviews assessing war-zone experiences, postdeployment drinking patterns, and PTSD symptoms. Veterans with positive mTBI screens and confirmed mTBI diagnoses endorsed higher rates of combat experiences, including direct and indirect killing, and met criteria for PTSD at a higher rate than Veterans without a history of mTBI. Both PTSD and combat experiences independently predicted screening positive for mTBI, whereas only combat experiences predicted receiving a confirmed mTBI diagnosis. mTBI was not associated with any dimension of alcohol use. These results support a growing body of literature linking mTBI with PTSD.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Behavioral economic demand curves measure individual differences in motivation for alcohol and have been associated with problematic patterns of alcohol use, but little is known about the variables that may contribute to elevated demand. Negative visceral states have been theorized to increase demand for alcohol and to contribute to excessive drinking patterns, but little empirical research has evaluated this possibility. The present study tested the hypothesis that symptoms of depression and PTSD would be uniquely associated with elevated alcohol demand even after taking into account differences in typical drinking levels. METHOD: An Alcohol Purchase Task (APT) was used to generate a demand curve measure of alcohol reinforcement in a sample of 133 college students (50.4% male, 64.4% Caucasian, 29.5% African-American) who reported at least one heavy drinking episode (5/4 or more drinks in one occasion for a man/woman) in the past month. Participants also completed standard measures of alcohol consumption and symptoms of depression and PTSD. RESULTS: Regression analyses indicated that symptoms of depression were associated with higher demand intensity (alcohol consumption when price=0; DeltaR(2)=.05, p=.002) and lower elasticity (DeltaR(2)=.04, p=.03), and that PTSD symptoms were associated with all five demand curve metrics (DeltaR(2)=.04-.07, ps<.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support for behavioral economic models of addiction that highlight the role of aversive visceral states in increasing the reward value of alcohol and provide an additional theoretical model to explain the association between negative affect and problematic drinking patterns.

Abstract:The period homolog genes Per1, Per2 and Per3 are important components of the circadian clock system. In addition to their role in maintaining circadian rhythm, these genes have been linked to mood disorders, stress response and vulnerability to addiction and alcoholism. In this study, we combined high-resolution sequence analysis and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of gene expression and behavioral traits to identify Per3 as a compelling candidate for the interaction between circadian rhythm, alcohol and stress response. In the BXD family of mouse strains, sequence variants in Per3 have marked effects on steady-state mRNA and protein levels. As a result, the transcript maps as a cis-acting expression QTL (eQTL). We found that an insertion/deletion (indel) variant in a putative stress response element in the promoter region of Per3 causes local control of transcript abundance. This indel results in differences in protein binding affinities between the two alleles through the Nrf2 transcriptional activator. Variation in Per3 is also associated with downstream differences in the expression of genes involved in circadian rhythm, alcohol, stress response and schizophrenia. We found that the Per3 locus is linked to stress/anxiety traits, and that the basal expression of Per3 is also correlated with several anxiety and addiction-related phenotypes. Treatment with alcohol results in increased expression of Per3 in the hippocampus, and this effect interacts with acute restraint stress. Our data provide strong evidence that variation in the Per3 transcript is causally associated with and also responsive to stress and alcohol.

Title:From threat to opportunity: a Head Start program's response to state-funded pre-K.
Authors:['Wrobel S']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, USA.
Abstract:Early childhood education and childcare have traditionally been dominated by nonprofit and other grant-funded agencies. However, public education agencies are increasingly involved with early childhood education through state funded pre-K program initiatives. As public pre-school programming has steadily expanded, programs such as Head Start have to compete for enrollment. As funds for these programs are tied directly to enrollment, the sustainability of these programs is uncertain. Not all such agencies view state funded pre-K as a threat however. Some have seized this as an opportunity to improve service delivery through interagency collaboration. This case study examines the partnership between an urban school district and its local Head Start program. Responding, in part, to the potential threat from state-funded Pre-K, Head Start partnered with the school district to provide enhanced services to Head Start eligible children in the district's early childhood education programs. Through an examination of secondary data and staff surveys, the collaboration is first evaluated in terms of the use of best practices. The success of the collaboration is measured through teacher and administrator perceptions. From these results, specific recommendations for early education and childcare providers are offered.

Title:Membrane damage to Escherichia coli and bactericidal kinetics by the alternative complement pathway of channel catfish.
Authors:['Jenkins JA', 'Ourth DD']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:1. Increased permeability of cytoplasmic membranes in Escherichia coli was a consequence of alternative complement pathway (ACP) activity of serum of channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus. Evidence was provided by beta-galactosidase activity extracellularly when E. coli was incubated with catfish serum. 2. Lesions were detected on outer membranes of E. coli following exposure to catfish serum. 3. Catfish ACP induced a temporal sequence of pre-killing and killing phases. 4. Loss of cell viability, killing rate and cytoplasmic enzyme release increased with increasing serum concentrations. 5. By incubating E. coli with sera treated to remove complement, both release of cytoplasmic enzyme and bactericidal activity were eliminated. 6. Lethal activity associated with channel catfish ACP against Gram-negative bacteria was functionally comparable to that seen in mammalian and reptilian systems.

Abstract:Protein ubiquitination is an essential post-translational modification regulating neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, and its dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Here we report a systematic analysis of ubiquitinated proteome (ubiquitome) in rat brain using a newly developed monoclonal antibody that recognizes the diglycine tag on lysine residues in trypsinized peptides (K-GG peptides). Initial antibody specificity analysis showed that the antibody can distinguish K-GG peptides from linear GG peptides or pseudo K-GG peptides derived from iodoacetamide. To evaluate the false discovery rate of K-GG peptide matches during database search, we introduced a null experiment using bacterial lysate that contains no such peptides. The brain ubiquitome was then analyzed by this antibody enrichment with or without strong cation exchange (SCX) prefractionation. During SCX chromatography, although the vast majority of K-GG peptides were detected in the fractions containing at least three positive charged peptides, specific K-GG peptides with two positive charges (e.g., protein N-terminal acetylated and C-terminal non-K/R peptides) were also identified in early fractions. The reliability of C-terminal K-GG peptides was also extensively investigated. Finally, we collected a data set of 1786 K-GG sites on 2064 peptides in 921 proteins and estimated their abundance by spectral counting. The study reveals a wide range of ubiquitination events on key components in presynaptic region (e.g., Bassoon, NSF, SNAP25, synapsin, synaptotagmin, and syntaxin) and postsynaptic density (e.g., PSD-95, GKAP, CaMKII, as well as receptors for NMDA, AMPA, GABA, serotonin, and acetylcholine). We also determined ubiquitination sites on amyloid precursor protein and alpha synuclein that are thought to be causative agents in Alzhermer's and Parkinson's disorders, respectively. As K-GG peptides can also be produced from Nedd8 or ISG15 modified proteins, we quantified these proteins in the brain and found that their levels are less than 2% of ubiquitin. Together, this study demonstrates that a large number of neuronal proteins are modified by ubiquitination and provides a feasible method for profiling the ubiquitome in the brain.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is an association between body mass index (BMI) and body esteem in young overweight and obese urban children, and to test peer relationship difficulties and perceived physical health as mediators of this relationship. METHODS: Child self-reported body esteem, and parent-reported child peer relationship difficulties (being bullied by peers and peer rejection) and physical health perceptions were obtained from 218 overweight and obese children aged 5-7 years (81% racial/ethnic minority, M BMI = 25.3) and their primary caregivers. RESULTS: Higher BMI was associated with lower body esteem for both girls and boys. This relation was mediated by poor physical health for boys but not for girls. Peer relationship difficulties did not mediate the observed association between BMI and body esteem in either group; however, girls with higher BMI experienced more bullying and being bullied by peers was associated with lower body esteem in girls. CONCLUSIONS: Intervening with perceptions of physical health may buffer overweight and obese boys from developing low body esteem in early childhood.

Abstract:AIMS: Effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation has not been evaluated in low income countries, such as Syria, where it is expensive and not widely available. We evaluated whether nicotine patch boosts smoking cessation rates when used in conjunction with behavioral support in primary care clinics in Aleppo, Syria. DESIGN: Two arm, parallel group, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blinded multi-site trial. SETTING: Four primary care clinics in Aleppo, Syria. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and sixty-nine adult primary care patients received behavioral cessation counseling from a trained primary care physician and were randomized to receive six weeks of treatment with nicotine versus placebo patch. MEASUREMENTS: Primary end-points were prolonged abstinence (no smoking after a 2-week grace period) at end of treatment, and 6 and 12 months post-quit day, assessed by self-report and exhaled carbon monoxide levels of <10 p.p.m. FINDINGS: Treatment adherence was excellent and nicotine patch produced expected reductions in urges to smoke and withdrawal symptoms, but no treatment effect was observed. The proportion of patients in the nicotine and placebo groups with prolonged abstinence was 21.6% and 20.0%, respectively, at end of treatment, 13.4% and 14.1% at 6 months, and 12.7% and 11.9% at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Nicotine patches may not be effective in helping smokers in low-income countries to stop when given as an adjunct to behavioural support.

Title:Effects of food availability on proceptivity: a test of the reproduction at all costs and metabolic fuels hypotheses.

Abstract:Proceptive behaviours are used by animals to indicate interest in opposite-sex conspecifics. These behaviours can be affected by an individual's nutritional status. Two mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed to account for the effects of food availability on reproduction. These are the metabolic fuels hypothesis and the reproduction at all costs hypothesis. It is not known if food availability affects proceptive behaviours such as scent marking, over-marking, and self-grooming. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that food-deprived and nonfood-deprived meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, differ in the number of scent marks they deposit, the proportion of over-marks they deposit, and the amount of time they spend self-grooming when they encounter the scent marks of opposite-sex conspecifics. We tested this hypothesis by exposing meadow voles that either had continuous access to food or were food-deprived for either 6 hours or 24 hours to the scent marks of an opposite-sex conspecific. Due to differences in the natural history of male and female meadow voles, we predicted that female voles' behaviour will best be explained by the metabolic fuels hypothesis whereas males' behaviour will best be explained by the reproduction at all costs hypothesis. We found that both male and female voles deprived of food for either 6 hours or 24 hours spent less time self-grooming compared to nonfood-deprived voles. However, food availability did not affect the scent marking and over-marking behaviour of male and female voles. Differences in the effects of food availability on these proceptive behaviours are discussed within the context of the natural history of meadow voles.

Abstract:Toward understanding the mechanisms of vascular wall remodeling, here we have studied the role of NFATc1 in MCP-1-induced human aortic smooth muscle cell (HASMC) growth and migration and injury-induced rat aortic wall remodeling. We have identified PKN1 as a novel downstream target of NFATc1-cyclin D1/CDK6 activity in mediating vascular wall remodeling following injury. MCP-1, a potent chemoattractant protein, besides enhancing HASMC motility, also induced its growth, and these effects require NFATc1-dependent cyclin D1 expression and CDK4/6 activity. In addition, MCP-1 induced PKN1 activation in a sustained and NFATc1-cyclin D1/CDK6-dependent manner. Furthermore, PKN1 activation is required for MCP-1-induced HASMC growth and migration. Balloon injury induced PKN1 activation in NFAT-dependent manner and pharmacological or dominant negative mutant-mediated blockade of PKN1 function or siRNA-mediated down-regulation of its levels substantially suppressed balloon injury-induced smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation resulting in reduced neointima formation. These novel findings suggest that PKN1 plays a critical role in vascular wall remodeling, and therefore, it could be a promising new target for the next generation of drugs for vascular diseases, particularly restenosis following angioplasty, stent implantation, or vein grafting.

Abstract:Children treated for posterior fossa tumors experience reduced cognitive processing speed and, after imaging, show damage to white matter (WM) tracts in the brain. This study explores relationships between white matter microstructure, assessed by fractional anisotropy (FA), and speed of cognitive processing using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). At 36 months after treatment with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, 40 patients completed an MRI examination and neuropsychological evaluation. Patients were matched with healthy control subjects based on age, sex, and race. Individual FA values were extracted from examinations for all voxels identified as having significant association between processing speed and FA using TBSS. The regions were labeled anatomically, and fiber tracts were grouped into larger fiber bundle categories based on their anatomical and functional associations. Analyses were performed between mean skeletal FA values in each of the fiber bundles and each of the cognitive processing scores controlling for age. Children 3 years after treatment for posterior fossa brain tumors demonstrate significantly lower processing speed associated with decreased FA, compared with their healthy peers. Commissural fibers in the corpus callosum were negatively affected by disease and therapy with detrimental consequence on patients' cognitive processing. Diffusion tensor imaging of the white matter tracts in the brain is relevant to determining potential mechanisms underlying clinically meaningful change in cognitive performance. Neuroprotective strategies are needed to preserve critical functions.

Title:Toward feedback-controlled anesthesia: voltammetric measurement of propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) in serum-like electrolyte solutions.
Authors:['Kivlehan F', 'Garay F', 'Guo J', 'Chaum E', 'Lindner E']

Abstract:Propofol is a widely used, potent intravenous anesthetic for ambulatory anesthesia and long-term sedation. The target steady state concentration of propofol in blood is 0.25-10 mug/mL (1-60 muM). Although propofol can be oxidized electrochemically, monitoring its concentration in biological matrixes is very challenging due to (i) low therapeutic concentration, (ii) high concentrations of easily oxidizable interfering compounds in the sample, and (iii) fouling of the working electrode. In this work we report the performance characteristics of an organic film coated glassy carbon (GC) electrode for continuous monitoring of propofol. The organic film (a plasticized PVC membrane) improved the detection limit and the selectivity of the voltammetric sensor due to the large difference in hydrophobicity between the analyte (propofol) and interfering compounds of the sample, e.g., ascorbic acid (AA) or p-acetamidophenol (APAP). Furthermore, the membrane coating prevented electrode fouling and served as a protective barrier against electrode passivation by proteins. Studies revealed that sensitivity and selectivity of the voltammetric method is greatly influenced by the composition of the PVC membrane. The detection limit of the membrane-coated sensor for propofol in PBS is reported as 0.03 +/- 0.01 muM. In serum-like electrolyte solutions containing physiologically relevant levels of albumin (5%) and 3 mM AA and 1 mM APAP as interfering agents, the detection limit was 0.5 +/- 0.4 muM. Both values are below the target concentrations used clinically during anesthesia or sedation.

Title:Oxidative cost of reproduction is sex specific and correlated with reproductive effort in a cooperatively breeding bird, the Florida scrub jay.

Abstract:Reproduction is energetically demanding, and how much an individual is able to invest in reproduction is often a function of its health state. An understanding of the relationship between oxidative balance and reproductive decisions, especially in free-living species, is still very limited. We evaluated the relationship between oxidative health and reproductive effort in a free-living population of the cooperatively breeding Florida scrub jay Aphelocoma coerulescens. Specifically, we assessed whether prebreeding oxidative damage levels predicted reproductive effort and subsequently whether postbreeding oxidative damage levels reflected reproductive effort. Prebreeding oxidative damage levels were negatively correlated with reproductive effort in males. In males, postbreeding levels of oxidative damage were significantly greater than prebreeding levels. Given that females exhibited no such patterns, our results suggest that in this species, males bear the brunt of the oxidative costs associated with reproduction.

Abstract:Amphibians are often exposed to a wide variety of perturbations. Two of these, pesticides and pathogens, are linked to declines in both amphibian health and population viability. Many studies have examined the separate effects of such perturbations; however, few have examined the effects of simultaneous exposure of both to amphibians. In this study, we exposed larval southern leopard frog tadpoles (Lithobates sphenocephalus) to the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and the fungicide thiophanate-methyl (TM) at 0.6 mg/L under laboratory conditions. The experiment was continued until all larvae completed metamorphosis or died. Overall, TM facilitated increases in tadpole mass and length. Additionally, individuals exposed to both TM and Bd were heavier and larger, compared to all other treatments. TM also cleared Bd in infected larvae. We conclude that TM affects larval anurans to facilitate growth and development while clearing Bd infection. Our findings highlight the need for more research into multiple perturbations, specifically pesticides and disease, to further promote amphibian heath.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) carries significant mortality and morbidity. Predicting which patients will become infected could lead to measures to reduce the incidence of VAP. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The goal was to begin constructing a model for VAP prediction in critically-injured trauma patients, and to identify differentially expressed genes in patients who go on to develop VAP compared to similar patients who do not. Gene expression profiles of lipopolysaccharide stimulated blood cells in critically injured trauma patients that went on to develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (n=10) was compared to those that never developed the infection (n=10). Eight hundred and ten genes were differentially expressed between the two groups (ANOVA, P<0.05) and further analyzed by hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis. Functional analysis using Gene Ontology and KEGG classifications revealed enrichment in multiple categories including regulation of protein translation, regulation of protease activity, and response to bacterial infection. A logistic regression model was developed that accurately predicted critically-injured trauma patients that went on to develop VAP (VAP+) and those that did not (VAP-). Five genes (PIK3R3, ATP2A1, PI3, ADAM8, and HCN4) were common to all top 20 significant genes that were identified from all independent training sets in the cross validation. Hierarchical clustering using these five genes accurately categorized 95% of patients and PCA visualization demonstrated two discernable groups (VAP+ and VAP-). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A logistic regression model using cross-validation accurately predicted patients that developed ventilator-associated pneumonia and should now be tested on a larger cohort of trauma patients.

Abstract:We have prepared a silica sol-gel using triethoxy (4-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl) silane (TETFMPS) as a precursor in ethanol solution under acidic condition. The prepared sol-gel was applied to the surface treatment of aluminum for corrosion prevention. Infrared and Raman spectra of the silane coupling agent, sol-gel and sol-gel films on metal have been collected. Infrared spectroscopy has been used to study the thermal effect on the chemical composition of xerogel. Results suggested that TETFMPS molecule has a C(s) point group symmetry with the plane of reflection orthogonal to the phenyl ring and the organic part of the sol-gel film remains essentially unchanged at or below 450 degrees C but decomposes at or above 550 degrees C. After the decomposition of the organic branch, the remaining film is composed of silica. Vibrational assignments were suggested by using the collected spectroscopic data in different states along with the group vibrational frequencies and other related references.

Title:An automated framework for hypotheses generation using literature.

Abstract:UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: In bio-medicine, exploratory studies and hypothesis generation often begin with researching existing literature to identify a set of factors and their association with diseases, phenotypes, or biological processes. Many scientists are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of literature on a disease when they plan to generate a new hypothesis or study a biological phenomenon. The situation is even worse for junior investigators who often find it difficult to formulate new hypotheses or, more importantly, corroborate if their hypothesis is consistent with existing literature. It is a daunting task to be abreast with so much being published and also remember all combinations of direct and indirect associations. Fortunately there is a growing trend of using literature mining and knowledge discovery tools in biomedical research. However, there is still a large gap between the huge amount of effort and resources invested in disease research and the little effort in harvesting the published knowledge. The proposed hypothesis generation framework (HGF) finds "crisp semantic associations" among entities of interest - that is a step towards bridging such gaps. METHODOLOGY: The proposed HGF shares similar end goals like the SWAN but are more holistic in nature and was designed and implemented using scalable and efficient computational models of disease-disease interaction. The integration of mapping ontologies with latent semantic analysis is critical in capturing domain specific direct and indirect "crisp" associations, and making assertions about entities (such as disease X is associated with a set of factors Z). RESULTS: Pilot studies were performed using two diseases. A comparative analysis of the computed "associations" and "assertions" with curated expert knowledge was performed to validate the results. It was observed that the HGF is able to capture "crisp" direct and indirect associations, and provide knowledge discovery on demand. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework is fast, efficient, and robust in generating new hypotheses to identify factors associated with a disease. A full integrated Web service application is being developed for wide dissemination of the HGF. A large-scale study by the domain experts and associated researchers is underway to validate the associations and assertions computed by the HGF.

Abstract:Adult cigarette smokers usually become dependent on cigarettes during adolescence. Despite recent advances in addiction genetics, little data delineates the genetic factors that account for the vulnerability of humans to smoke tobacco. We studied the operant nicotine self-administration (SA) behavior of six inbred strains of adolescent male rats (Fisher 344, Brown Norway, Dark Agouti, Spontaneous Hypertensive Rat, Wistar Kyoto and Lewis) and six selected F1 hybrids. All rats were trained to press a lever to obtain food starting on postnatal day (PN) 32, and then nicotine (0.03 mg/kg/infusion, i.v.) reinforcement was made available on PN41-42 (10 consecutive daily 2 h sessions). Of the 12 isogenic strains, Fisher rats self-administered the fewest nicotine infusions (1.45 +/- 0.36/d) during the last 3 d, while Lewis rats took the most nicotine (13.0 +/- 1.4/d). These strains sorted into high, intermediate and low self-administration groups in 2, 2, and 8 strains, respectively. The influence of heredity on nicotine SA (0.64) is similar to that reported for humans. Therefore, this panel of isogenic rat strains effectively models the overall impact of genetics on the vulnerability to acquire nicotine-reinforced behavior during adolescence. Separate groups of rats responded for food starting on PN41. The correlation between nicotine and food reward was not significant. Hence, the genetic control of the motivation to obtain nicotine is distinctly different from food reward, indicating the specificity of the underlying genetic mechanisms. Lastly, the behavior of F1 hybrids was not predicted from the additive behavior of the parental strains, indicating the impact of significant gene-gene interactions on the susceptibility to nicotine reward. Taken together, the behavioral characteristics of this model indicate its strong potential to identify specific genes mediating the human vulnerability to smoke cigarettes.

Abstract:Oxyma and an oxyma derivative, (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl 2-cyano-2-(hydroxyimino)acetate (5b), displayed a remarkable effect on selective esterifications of primary alcohols. A wide range of carboxylic acids could be esterified with primary alcohols by using EDCI, NaHCO(3), and Oxyma or Oxyma derivative 5b in 5% H(2)O-CH(3)CN. Oxyma derivative 5b is particularly useful, since it could be removed after the reaction via a simple basic or an acidic aqueous workup procedure.

Affiliation:Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Biochemistry, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.
Abstract:Members of the tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins are being recognized as important regulators of host innate immunity. However, specific TRIMs that contribute to TLR3-mediated antiviral defense have not been identified. We show here that TRIM56 is a positive regulator of TLR3 signaling. Overexpression of TRIM56 substantially potentiated extracellular dsRNA-induced expression of interferon (IFN)-beta and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), while knockdown of TRIM56 greatly impaired activation of IRF3, induction of IFN-beta and ISGs, and establishment of an antiviral state by TLR3 ligand and severely compromised TLR3-mediated chemokine induction following infection by hepatitis C virus. The ability to promote TLR3 signaling was independent of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM56. Rather, it correlated with a physical interaction between TRIM56 and TRIF. Deletion of the C-terminal portion of TRIM56 abrogated the TRIM56-TRIF interaction as well as the augmentation of TLR3-mediated IFN response. Together, our data demonstrate TRIM56 is an essential component of the TLR3 antiviral signaling pathway and reveal a novel role for TRIM56 in innate antiviral immunity.

Abstract:Silver nanoparticles-polymer nanocomposites, Ag-(1 - x)PVP-(x)PEG, were synthesized by wet chemical method in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). A mixture of two stabilizing agent PVP and PEG is found to play a crucial role in controlling the morphology of nanocrystalline silver particles in the composite. This is inferred based on the shape and size study of nanocrystalline silver using the X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Uv-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, and surface enhance Raman studies. These results suggest asymmetrical growth of silver nanocrystalline particles in the presence of both PVP and PEG. Comparison of the thermal properties of the Ag-polymer nanocomposites with pure polymers, PVP and PEG, showed that the thermal stability of the nanocomposite deteriorates by as much as 75 degrees C in the presence of low PEG concentration (x < or = 0.6) and improves by around 45 degrees C at higher PEG concentration (x > 0.6). The study highlight the fact that the morphology of nanocrystalline silver can be altered just by varying the polymer weight ratios rather than any processing parameters, thus offering a novel, simple, and controlled synthesis engineering route to the formation of nanocrystalline silver in polymer matrix.

Abstract:Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) plays an important role in bioenergetic processes and has antioxidant activity. Fifteen exercise-trained individuals (10 men and 5 women; 30-65 years) received reduced CoQ10 (Kaneka QH ubiquinol; 300 mg per day) or a placebo for four weeks in a random order, double blind, cross-over design (3 week washout). After each four-week period, a graded exercise treadmill test and a repeated cycle sprint test were performed (separated by 48 hours). Blood samples were collected before and immediately following both exercise tests and analyzed for lactate, malondialdehyde, and hydrogen peroxide. Resting blood samples were analyzed for CoQ10 (ubiquinone and ubiquinol) profile before and after each treatment period. Treatment with CoQ10 resulted in a significant increase in total blood CoQ10 (138%; P = 0.02) and reduced blood CoQ10 (168%; P = 0.02), but did not improve exercise performance (with the exception of selected individuals) or impact oxidative stress. The relationship between the percentage change in total blood CoQ10 and the cycle sprint total work (R(2) = 0.6009) was noted to be moderate to strong. We conclude that treatment with CoQ10 in healthy, exercise-trained subjects increases total and reduced blood CoQ10, but this increase does not translate into improved exercise performance or decreased oxidative stress.

Abstract:UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: The Daniel Fast is a vegan diet that prohibits the consumption of animal products, refined foods, white flour, preservatives, additives, sweeteners, flavorings, caffeine, and alcohol. Following this dietary plan for 21 days has been demonstrated to improve blood pressure, LDL-C, and certain markers of oxidative stress, but it has also been shown to lower HDL-C. Krill oil supplementation has been shown to increase HDL-C. METHODS: We investigated the effects of following a Daniel Fast dietary plan with either krill oil supplementation (2 g/day) or placebo supplementation (coconut oil; 2 g/day) for 21 days. The subjects in this study (12 men and 27 women) were heterogeneous with respect to body mass index (BMI) (normal weight, overweight, and obese), blood lipids (normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic), blood glucose (normal fasting glucose, impaired fasting glucose, and type 2 diabetic), and blood pressure (normotensive and hypertensive). RESULTS: Krill oil supplementation had no effect on any outcome measure (all p > 0.05), and so the data from the krill oil group and the placebo group were collapsed and analyzed to examine the effects of following a 21-day Daniel Fast. Significant reductions were observed in LDL-C (100.6 +/- 4.3 mg/dL vs. 80.0 +/- 3.7 mg/dL), the LDL:HDL ratio (2.0 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.1), fasting blood glucose (101.4 +/- 7.5 mg/dL vs. 91.7 +/- 3.4 mg/dL), fasting blood insulin (7.92 +/- 0.80 muU/mL vs. 5.76 +/- 0.59 muU/mL), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (2.06 +/- 0.30 vs. 1.40 +/- 0.21), systolic BP (110.7 +/- 2.2 mm Hg vs. 105.5 +/- 1.7 mm Hg), and body weight (74.1 +/- 2.4 kg vs. 71.5 +/- 2.3 kg) (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Following a Daniel Fast dietary plan improves a variety of cardiometabolic parameters in a wide range of individuals in as little as 21 days, and these improvements are unaffected by krill oil supplementation.

Title:Effects of adolescent nicotine exposure and withdrawal on intravenous cocaine self-administration during adulthood in male C57BL/6J mice.

Abstract:Studies of adolescent drug use show (1) a pattern in which the use of tobacco precedes the use of other drugs and (2) a positive relationship between adolescent tobacco use and later drug use. These observations have led to the hypothesis that a causal relationship exists between early exposure to nicotine and the later use of hard drugs such as cocaine. Using male C57BL/6J mice, we tested the hypothesis that nicotine exposure in adolescence leads to increased intravenous self-administration (IVSA) of cocaine in adulthood. Using miniature osmotic pumps, we exposed mice and their littermate controls to nicotine (24 mg/kg/day) or vehicle, respectively, over the entire course of adolescence [postnatal days (P) 28-56]. Nicotine exposure was terminated on P56 and mice were not exposed to nicotine again during the experiment. On P73, mice were allowed to acquire cocaine IVSA (1.0 mg/kg/infusion) and a dose-response curve was generated (0.18, 0.32, 0.56, 1.0, 1.8 mg/kg/infusion). Lever pressing during extinction conditions was also evaluated. All mice rapidly learned to lever press for the combination of cocaine infusions and non-drug stimuli. Analysis of the dose-response curve revealed that adolescent nicotine-exposed mice self-administered significantly more (P < 0.05) cocaine than controls at all but the highest dose. No significant differences were observed between adolescent nicotine-exposed and control mice during the acquisition or extinction stages. These results indicate that adolescent nicotine exposure can increase cocaine IVSA in mice, which suggests the possibility of a causal link between adolescent tobacco use and later cocaine use in humans.

Title:Behavior matching in multimodal communication is synchronized.
Authors:['Louwerse MM', 'Dale R', 'Bard EG', 'Jeuniaux P']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA. maxlouwerse@gmail.com
Abstract:A variety of theoretical frameworks predict the resemblance of behaviors between two people engaged in communication, in the form of coordination, mimicry, or alignment. However, little is known about the time course of the behavior matching, even though there is evidence that dyads synchronize oscillatory motions (e.g., postural sway). This study examined the temporal structure of nonoscillatory actions-language, facial, and gestural behaviors-produced during a route communication task. The focus was the temporal relationship between matching behaviors in the interlocutors (e.g., facial behavior in one interlocutor vs. the same facial behavior in the other interlocutor). Cross-recurrence analysis revealed that within each category tested (language, facial, gestural), interlocutors synchronized matching behaviors, at temporal lags short enough to provide imitation of one interlocutor by the other, from one conversational turn to the next. Both social and cognitive variables predicted the degree of temporal organization. These findings suggest that the temporal structure of matching behaviors provides low-level and low-cost resources for human interaction.

Title:The role of personal attributes in the genesis and progression of lung disease and cigarette smoking.
Authors:['Brook A', 'Zhang C']
Affiliation:Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. doctorbrook@gmail.com
Abstract:OBJECTIVES: We examined early maladaptive personal attributes (e.g., depression), later lung disease, and later maladaptive personal attributes over a significant part of a woman's life. METHODS: We gathered longitudinal data on a prospective cohort of community-dwelling women (n = 498) followed from young adulthood to late midlife. Results. We used structural equation modeling to assess the interrelations of maladaptive personal attributes, cigarette smoking, lung disease, and financial strain. The results supported a mediational model through which early maladaptive personal attributes were associated with smoking (b = 0.17, P < .001), which in turn predicted later lung disease (b = 0.33, P < .001), and lung disease was related to later family financial difficulties (b = 0.09, P < .05), which in turn were associated with later maladaptive personal attributes (b = 0.35, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results address a number of important public health and clinical issues. An understanding of the interrelations of smoking, underlying mental health conditions, financial stress, and later mental health conditions on the part of physicians and other health care providers can be critical in managing patients with lung disease.

Abstract:Local versus systemic antibiotic delivery may be an effective strategy for treating musculoskeletal infections, especially when antibiotic-resistant bacteria are present. Lyophilized uncrosslinked, genipin crosslinked, and genipin crosslinked with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) chitosan sponges were analyzed for their in vitro degradation rate, chemical crosslinking, antibiotic uptake, elution, biologic activity, and cytotoxicity. These evaluations were pursued to determine if crosslinking with genipin could be used to create a tailorable point of care loaded sponge for local infection control. Crosslinking the chitosan sponges decreased degradation in phosphate-buffered saline from 4.48 +/- 2.28 wt % remaining of the uncrosslinked sponges to 78.82 +/- 1.15 and 73.87 +/- 1.27 wt % remaining at week 1 for the genipin and PNIPAM/genipin crosslinked sponges, respectively. The PNIPAM/genipin crosslinked sponges exhibited the most sustained release of biologically active antibiotics, with an average antibiotic release 63% higher than uncrosslinked and 37% higher than genipin crosslinked sponges, after 96 h. No significant cytotoxic effects from sponges or eluates were exhibited with NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. These preliminary results indicate that genipin crosslinked chitosan sponges, with or without PNIPAM, have potential as local delivery systems for adjunctive therapy for infection control, especially when longer degradation periods and higher antibiotic elutions are desired.

Title:Structure and catalytic function of sphingosine kinases: analysis by site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme kinetics.
Authors:['Baker DL', 'Pham TC', 'Sparks MA']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. dlbaker@memphis.edu
Abstract:Sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (SK1 and SK2) generate the bioactive lipid mediator sphingosine 1-phosphate and as such play a significant role in cell fate and in human health and disease. Despite significant interest in and examination of the role played by SK enzymes in disease, comparatively little is currently known about the three-dimensional structure and catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes. To date, limited numbers of studies have used site directed mutagenesis and activity determinations to examine the roles of individual SK residues in substrate, calmodulin, and membrane binding, as well as activation via phosphorylation. Assays are currently available that allow for both single and bisubstrate kinetic analysis of mutant proteins that show normal, lowered and enhanced activity as compared to wild type controls. Additional studies will be required to build on this foundation to completely understand SK mediated substrate binding and phosphoryl group transfer. A deeper understanding of the SK catalytic mechanism, as well as SK interactions with potential small molecule inhibitors will be invaluable to the future design and identification of SK activity modulators as research tools and potential therapeutics. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Advances in Lysophospholipid Research.

Title:Influence of methylsulfonylmethane on markers of exercise recovery and performance in healthy men: a pilot study.
Authors:['Kalman DS', 'Feldman S', 'Scheinberg AR', 'Krieger DR', 'Bloomer RJ']

Abstract:UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) has been reported to provide anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in both animal and man. Strenuous resistance exercise has the potential to induce both inflammation and oxidative stress. Using a pilot (proof of concept) study design, we determined the influence of MSM on markers of exercise recovery and performance in healthy men. METHODS: Eight, healthy men (27.1 +/- 6.9 yrs old) who were considered to be moderately exercise-trained (exercising <150 minutes per week) were randomly assigned to ingest MSM at either 1.5 grams per day or 3.0 grams per day for 30 days (28 days before and 2 days following exercise). Before and after the 28 day intervention period, subjects performed 18 sets of knee extension exercise in an attempt to induce muscle damage (and to be used partly as a measure of exercise performance). Sets 1-15 were performed at a predetermined weight for 10 repetitions each, while sets 16-18 were performed to muscular failure. Muscle soreness (using a 5-point Likert scale), fatigue (using the fatigue-inertia subset of the Profile of Mood States), blood antioxidant status (glutathione and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity [TEAC]), and blood homocysteine were measured before and after exercise, pre and post intervention. Exercise performance (total work performed during sets 16-18 of knee extension testing) was also measured pre and post intervention. RESULTS: Muscle soreness increased following exercise and a trend was noted for a reduction in muscle soreness with 3.0 grams versus 1.5 grams of MSM (p = 0.080), with a 1.0 point difference between dosages. Fatigue was slightly reduced with MSM (p = 0.073 with 3.0 grams; p = 0.087 for both dosages combined). TEAC increased significantly following exercise with 3.0 grams of MSM (p = 0.035), while homocysteine decreased following exercise for both dosages combined (p = 0.007). No significant effects were noted for glutathione or total work performed during knee extension testing (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: MSM, especially when provided at 3.0 grams per day, may favorably influence selected markers of exercise recovery. More work is needed to extend these findings, in particular using a larger sample of subjects and the inclusion of additional markers of exercise recovery and performance.

Title:Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity overcomes NK cell resistance in MLL-rearranged leukemia expressing inhibitory KIR ligands but not activating ligands.
Authors:['Chan WK', 'Kung Sutherland M', 'Li Y', 'Zalevsky J', 'Schell S', 'Leung W']
Affiliation:Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-3678, USA.
Abstract:PURPOSE: Leukemias with MLL gene rearrangement are associated with a poor prognosis. Natural killer (NK) cell therapy is a potential treatment, but leukemia cells may be resistant. Here, we sought to determine the susceptibility of MLL-rearranged leukemia cells to NK cell lysis and to develop a novel immunotherapeutic approach to optimize NK cell therapy, including the use of an antibody against leukemia-associated antigen and the elimination of killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-mediated inhibition. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines (RS4;11, SEM, and MV4-11) and primary leukemia blasts were assessed for surface phenotype and susceptibility to NK cell lysis with or without antibodies against CD19 (XmAb5574), CD33 (lintuzumab), or KIR ligands. RESULTS: All three cell lines were resistant to NK cell lysis, had some inhibitory KIR ligands and protease inhibitor-9, and expressed low levels of NKG2D activating ligands and adhesion molecules. After treatment with XmAb5574 or lintuzumab, MLL-rearranged leukemia cells were efficiently killed by NK cells. The addition of pan-major histocompatibility complex class I antibody, which blocked inhibitory KIR-HLA interaction, further augmented degranulation in all three KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2/3, and KIR3DL1 subsets of NK cells based on the rule of missing-self recognition. A mouse model showed a decreased rate of leukemia progression in vivo as monitored by bioluminescence imaging and longer survival after antibody treatment. CONCLUSION: Our data support the use of a triple immunotherapy approach, including an antibody directed against tumor-associated antigen, KIR-mismatched NK cell transplantation, and inhibitory KIR blockade, for the treatment of NK cell-resistant MLL-rearranged leukemias.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE To determine whether racial and ethnic minorities were less likely to meet the Medicare Part D eligibility criteria for medication therapy management (MTM) services compared with whites among the adult non-Medicare population, because some non-Medicare health plans have followed the Medicare example. DESIGN Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING United States, 2007-08. PATIENTS 16,691 white, 5,923 black, and 9,242 Hispanic adults (&gt;17 years) among the non-Medicare population. INTERVENTION Analysis of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. MTM eligibility criteria used by Part D plans in 2008 and 2010-11 were examined. Main and sensitivity analyses were conducted to represent the entire range of the eligibility thresholds used by Part D plans. Analyses also were conducted among individuals with heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Proportions and odds of patients meeting Part D MTM eligibility criteria. RESULTS According to the main analysis examining 2008 eligibility criteria, whites had a higher proportion of eligible individuals than did blacks (3.73% vs. 2.57%) and Hispanics (1.53%, P &lt; 0.05 for both comparisons). According to survey-weighted logistic regression adjusting for patient characteristics, blacks and Hispanics had odds ratios for MTM eligibility of 0.60 (95% CI 0.46-0.79) and 0.54 (0.40-0.72), respectively, compared with whites. Sensitivity analyses, analyses examining 2010-11 eligibility criteria, and analyses among individuals with heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension produced similar findings. CONCLUSION Racial and ethnic minorities have lower odds for meeting Part D MTM eligibility criteria than whites among the adult non-Medicare population. MTM eligibility criteria need to be modified to address these disparities.

Abstract:The next generational leap in computer navigation will hopefully aid surgeons in personalizing surgical techniques to patients' individual anatomical variables to optimize outcomes. To effectively use the information obtained in the operating room, a multitude of kinematic variables must be conveyed to the orthopedic surgeon in a usable and coherent manner. This study used an intraoperative navigation system to record passive knee kinematics after a total knee arthroplastyperformed. The clinical measures were taken via research software with the ability to record kinematic data in 10-second intervals. The data from 10 consecutive clinical cases were averaged, and the translation (anterior/posterior) and rotation (internal/external) were recorded and compared from 0 degrees to 100 degrees of flexion to allow for comparison with the previously recorded computer model. Model and clinical curves compared favorably, with less than 1 degrees rotational and 1.5-mm differences, on average. The comparison of information and analyses were reviewed to indicate how they might be interpreted in the operating room for future use during surgery to allow a more personalized approach to improving functional outcomes after total knee arthroplasty.

Title:Representing spatial structure through maps and language: Lord of the Rings encodes the spatial structure of middle Earth.
Authors:['Louwerse MM', 'Benesh N']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA. maxlouwerse@gmail.com
Abstract:Spatial mental representations can be derived from linguistic and non-linguistic sources of information. This study tested whether these representations could be formed from statistical linguistic frequencies of city names, and to what extent participants differed in their performance when they estimated spatial locations from language or maps. In a computational linguistic study, we demonstrated that co-occurrences of cities in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit predicted the authentic longitude and latitude of those cities in Middle Earth. In a human study, we showed that human spatial estimates of the location of cities were very similar regardless of whether participants read Tolkien's texts or memorized a map of Middle Earth. However, text-based location estimates obtained from statistical linguistic frequencies better predicted the human text-based estimates than the human map-based estimates. These findings suggest that language encodes spatial structure of cities, and that human cognitive map representations can come from implicit statistical linguistic patterns, from explicit non-linguistic perceptual information, or from both.

Title:Monitoring cell-autonomous circadian clock rhythms of gene expression using luciferase bioluminescence reporters.
Authors:['Ramanathan C', 'Khan SK', 'Kathale ND', 'Xu H', 'Liu AC']
Affiliation:Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Memphis, USA.
Abstract:In mammals, many aspects of behavior and physiology such as sleep-wake cycles and liver metabolism are regulated by endogenous circadian clocks (reviewed). The circadian time-keeping system is a hierarchical multi-oscillator network, with the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizing and coordinating extra-SCN and peripheral clocks elsewhere. Individual cells are the functional units for generation and maintenance of circadian rhythms, and these oscillators of different tissue types in the organism share a remarkably similar biochemical negative feedback mechanism. However, due to interactions at the neuronal network level in the SCN and through rhythmic, systemic cues at the organismal level, circadian rhythms at the organismal level are not necessarily cell-autonomous. Compared to traditional studies of locomotor activity in vivo and SCN explants ex vivo, cell-based in vitro assays allow for discovery of cell-autonomous circadian defects. Strategically, cell-based models are more experimentally tractable for phenotypic characterization and rapid discovery of basic clock mechanisms. Because circadian rhythms are dynamic, longitudinal measurements with high temporal resolution are needed to assess clock function. In recent years, real-time bioluminescence recording using firefly luciferase as a reporter has become a common technique for studying circadian rhythms in mammals, as it allows for examination of the persistence and dynamics of molecular rhythms. To monitor cell-autonomous circadian rhythms of gene expression, luciferase reporters can be introduced into cells via transient transfection or stable transduction. Here we describe a stable transduction protocol using lentivirus-mediated gene delivery. The lentiviral vector system is superior to traditional methods such as transient transfection and germline transmission because of its efficiency and versatility: it permits efficient delivery and stable integration into the host genome of both dividing and non-dividing cells. Once a reporter cell line is established, the dynamics of clock function can be examined through bioluminescence recording. We first describe the generation of P(Per2)-dLuc reporter lines, and then present data from this and other circadian reporters. In these assays, 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and U2OS human osteosarcoma cells are used as cellular models. We also discuss various ways of using these clock models in circadian studies. Methods described here can be applied to a great variety of cell types to study the cellular and molecular basis of circadian clocks, and may prove useful in tackling problems in other biological systems.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Non-Hispanic Blacks (Blacks) and Hispanics have a lower likelihood of being eligible for medication therapy management (MTM) services than do non-Hispanic Whites (Whites) based on Medicare MTM eligibility criteria. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether MTM eligibility criteria would perform differently over time, this study examined the trend of MTM disparities from 1996-1997 to 2007-2008. METHODS: The study populations were Medicare beneficiaries from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Proportions and the odds of MTM eligibility were compared between Whites and ethnic minorities. The trend of disparities was examined by including in logistic regression models interaction terms between dummy variables for the minority groups and 2007-2008. MTM eligibility thresholds for 2008 and 2010-2011 were analyzed. Main and sensitivity analyses were conducted to represent the entire range of the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: This study found no statistical significant racial or ethnic disparities associated with the MTM eligibility criteria for 2008 among the Medicare population during 1996-1997. However, racial disparities associated with 2010-2011 MTM eligibility criteria were significant according to multivariate analyses among the Medicare population during 1996-1997. During 2007-2008, both racial and ethnic disparities associated with both 2008 MTM eligibility criteria and 2010-2011 eligibility criteria were generally significant. Disparity patterns did not exhibit a statistically significant change from 1996-1997 to 2007-2008. CONCLUSIONS: Racial and ethnic disparities in meeting MTM eligibility criteria may not decrease over time unless MTM eligibility criteria are changed.

Title:Fine structure of the fat body and nephrocytes in the life-stages of Dermacentor variabilis.

Abstract:The fine structure of the fat body and associated nephrocytes of the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis (Say), was described in unfed larvae, unfed nymphs, and in unfed and fed adults of both sexes. The fat body consisted of one type of cell, the trophocyte. Morphological changes that occurred in the trophocytes of both sexes were dependent on feeding. The ultrastructure of feeding male trophocytes was distinct from trophocytes of feeding females. In the feeding female, the trophocyte developed an ultrastructure characteristic of cells that produce secretory proteins. A type of scalariform cell junction was found associated with rough endoplasmic reticulum of the trophocytes. Nephrocytes were closely associated with trophocytes but were not part of the fat body. Nephrocyte ultrastructure was unaltered throughout the life-stages we examined, except at the end of oviposition. Organelles in the nephrocytes were not randomly distributed, but were found in distinct regions of the cytoplasm. Slit diaphragms at the surface of the nephrocytes were extracellular specializations that had a periodic ultrastructure.

Title:Evaluation of an in-situ output probe-microphone method for hearing aid fitting verification.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:Several hearing aid prescription procedures specify frequency gain functions in terms of the desired levels of amplified speech. The most direct method for verifying hearing aid fittings based on these procedures requires a measurement of amplified speech in the ear canal. This paper describes the evaluation of a probe microphone measurement procedure designed to measure amplified speech to verify hearing aid fittings using the MSUv3 prescription procedure. With minor modifications, the same protocol could be used with other prescriptive procedures. Hearing aids were fitted to a group of subjects with sensorineural hearing impairment. Data derived from the fittings were analyzed to assess several issues relating to the procedure itself and to prescriptive fittings in general. The main results were: (1) with over the ear hearing aids, most prescriptions can be matched with an RMS error of 5 dB or less through the frequency range from 500 to 2500 Hz; (2) even though actual fittings usually do not perfectly correspond with their prescriptions, differences among frequency gain prescriptions are preserved in hearing aid fittings if the RMS error of the fitting is 5 dB or less; (3) if sound field stimuli presented to the hearing aid are precisely controlled, an in situ output verification method produces valid results; (4) when hearing aids are fitted with gain similar to that prescribed by the MSUv3 procedure, the maximum comfortable speech input level is typically about 72 dB; (5) the SSPL90 prescription generated by the MSUv3 procedure overestimates desired SSPL90 by 7 dB on average.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Dust accumulation on surfaces of critical instruments has been a major concern during lunar and Mars missions. Operation of instruments such as solar panels, chromatic calibration targets, as well as Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) suits has been severely compromised in the past as a result of dust accumulation and adhesion. Wind storms with wind speeds of up to 70 mph have not been effective in removing significant amounts of the deposited dust. This is indeed an indication of the strength of the adhesion force(s) involved between the dust particles and the surface(s) that they have adhered to. Complications associated with dust accumulation are more severe for non-conducting surfaces and have been the focus of this work. METHODOLOGY: Argon plasma treatment was investigated as a mechanism for lowering dust accumulation on non-conducting polymeric surfaces. Polymers chosen for this study include a popular variety of silicones routinely used for space and terrestrial applications namely RTV 655, RTV 615, and Sylgard 184. Surface properties including wettability, surface potential, and surface charge density were compared before and after plasma treatment and under different storage conditions. Effect of ultraviolet radiation on RTV 655 was also investigated and compared with the effect of Ar plasma treatment. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Gravimetric measurements proved Ar plasma treatment to be an effective method for eliminating dust adhesion to all three polymers after short periods of exposure. No physical damage was detected on any of the polymer surfaces after Ar plasma treatment. The surface potential of all three polymers remained zero up to three months post plasma exposure. Ultraviolet radiation however was not effective in reducing surface and caused damage and significant discoloration to RTV 655. Therefore, Ar plasma treatment can be an effective and non-destructive method for treating insulating polymeric surfaces in order to eliminate dust adhesion and accumulation.

Abstract:Increased understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cognitive remediation is needed to facilitate development of intervention strategies for childhood cancer survivors experiencing cognitive late effects. Accordingly, a pilot functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted with 14 cancer survivors (12.02 +/- 0.09 years old), who participated in a cognitive remediation clinical trial, and 28 healthy children (12.7 +/- 0.6 years old). The ventral visual areas, cerebellum, supplementary motor area, and left inferior frontal cortex were significantly activated in the healthy participants during a continuous performance task. In survivors, brain activation in these regions was diminished at baseline, and increased upon completion of remediation and at a 6-month follow-up. The fMRI activation index for each region of interest was inversely associated with the Conners' Clinical Competence Index (p<.01). The pilot study suggests that fMRI is useful in evaluating neural responses to cognitive remediation.

Abstract:Spirituality is an essential aspect of a patient's health that can and should be integrated into routine health care. Despite recommendations of accrediting organizations such as the Association of American Medical Colleges, the National Association of Social Workers, and the Association of Professional Chaplains, there is little well defined curriculum focusing on interprofessional spiritual assessment. This article explores one program's use of an interprofessional approach in teaching spiritual assessment to students from medicine, social work, and chaplaincy. Learning objectives were adapted from the Association of American Medical Colleges Medical School Objectives Project. Workshop evaluations show that students can learn key concepts of spirituality and the basics of spiritual assessment while developing an understanding and respect for the role of chaplains, social workers, and physicians.

Abstract:Due to limitations of bone autografts and allografts, synthetic bone grafts using osteoconductive biomaterials have been designed. In this study, collagen-chitosan-calcium phosphate microparticle-based scaffolds fused with glycolic acid were compared to their counterparts without collagen in terms of degradation, cytocompatibility, porosity, and Young's modulus. It was found that 26-30% collagen was incorporated and that hydroxyapatite was present. Moreover, there were no differences between control and collagen scaffolds in degradation, cytocompatibility, porosity, and Young's modulus. In general, scaffolds exhibited 23% porosity, 0.6-1.2 MPa Young's modulus, 23% degradation over 4 weeks, and supported a four to seven fold increase in osteoblast cell number over 7 days in culture. Collagen can be incorporated into these bone graft substitute scaffolds, which show an improved degradation profile.

Abstract:BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To analyze the utilization and hospital charges associated with robotic (RS) versus laparoscopic (LS) versus open surgery (OS) in endometrial cancer patients. METHODS: Hospital discharge data were extracted from Florida Agency for Health Care Administration between October 2008 and December 2009. RESULTS: Of 2,247 patients (median age: 64 years), 29% had RS, 10% had LS, and 61% had OS. The mean length of hospital stay was 1.6, 1.8, and 3.9 days for RS, LS, and OS, respectively (P < 0.001). The median hospital charge was $51,569, $37,202, and $36,492, for RS, LS, and OS (P < 0.001), with operating room charges ($22,600, $13,684, and $11,272) accounting for the major difference. Robotic surgery utilization increased by 11% (23-34%) over time. CONCLUSIONS: In this statewide analysis of endometrial cancer patients, the utilization of robotic surgery increased and is associated with higher hospital charges compared to laparoscopic and open procedures.

Abstract:Chloracne is commonly observed in humans exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD); yet, the mechanism of toxicity is not well understood. Using normal human epidermal keratinocytes, we investigated the mechanism of TCDD-mediated enhancement of epidermal differentiation by integrating functional genomic, metabolomic, and biochemical analyses. TCDD increased the expression of 40% of the genes of the epidermal differentiation complex found on chromosome 1q21 and 75% of the genes required for de novo ceramide biosynthesis. Lipid analysis demonstrated that eight of the nine classes of ceramides were increased by TCDD, altering the ratio of ceramides to free fatty acids. TCDD decreased the expression of the glucose transporter, SLC2A1, and most of the glycolytic transcripts, followed by decreases in glycolytic intermediates, including pyruvate. NADH and Krebs cycle intermediates were decreased, whereas NAD(+) was increased. Mitochondrial glutathione (GSH) reductase activity and the GSH/glutathione disulfide ratio were decreased by TCDD, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by decreased inner mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, and increased production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) antagonists blocked the response of many transcripts to TCDD, and the endpoints of decreased ATP production and differentiation, suggesting regulation by the AHR. Cotreatment of cells with chemical antioxidants or the enzyme catalase blocked the TCDD-mediated acceleration of keratinocyte cornified envelope formation, an endpoint of terminal differentiation. Thus, TCDD-mediated ROS production is a critical step in the mechanism of this chemical to accelerate keratinocyte differentiation.

Title:Effect of initial ion positions on the interactions of monovalent and divalent ions with a DNA duplex as revealed with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.
Authors:['Robbins TJ', 'Wang Y']
Affiliation:a Department of Chemistry , University of Memphis , Memphis , TN , 38152 , USA .
Abstract:Monovalent (Na(+)) and divalent (Mg(2+)) ion distributions around the Dickerson-Drew dodecamer were studied by atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with AMBER molecular modeling software. Different initial placements of ions were tried and the resulting effects on the ion distributions around DNA were investigated. For monovalent ions, results were found to be nearly independent of initial cation coordinates. However, Mg(2+) ions demonstrated a strong initial coordinate dependent behavior. While some divalent ions initially placed near the DNA formed essentially permanent direct coordination complexes with electronegative DNA atoms, Mg(2+) ions initially placed further away from the duplex formed a full, nonexchanging, octahedral first solvation shell. These fully solvated cations were still capable of binding with DNA with events lasting up to 20 ns, and in comparison were bound much longer than Na(+) ions. Force field parameters were also investigated with modest and little differences arising from ion (ions94 and ions08) and nucleic acid description (ff99, ff99bsc0, and ff10), respectively. Based on known Mg(2+) ion solvation structure, we conclude that in most cases Mg(2+) ions retain their first solvation shell, making only solvent-mediated contacts with DNA duplex. The proper way to simulate Mg(2+) ions around DNA duplex, therefore, should begin with ions placed in the bulk water.

Abstract:To define the mutation spectrum in non-Down syndrome acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (non-DS-AMKL), we performed transcriptome sequencing on diagnostic blasts from 14 pediatric patients and validated our findings in a recurrency/validation cohort consisting of 34 pediatric and 28 adult AMKL samples. Our analysis identified a cryptic chromosome 16 inversion (inv(16)(p13.3q24.3)) in 27% of pediatric cases, which encodes a CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion protein. Expression of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 in Drosophila and murine hematopoietic cells induced bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling and resulted in a marked increase in the self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic progenitors. These data suggest that expression of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 directly contributes to leukemogenesis.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Pathologic nodal stage is the key prognostic factor in resectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mediastinal lymph node (MLN) metastasis connotes a poor prognosis. Yet, some NSCLC resections exclude MLN examination. METHODS: We analyzed U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data from 1998 to 2002 to quantify the long-term survival impact of failure to examine MLN in resected NSCLC. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to compare the unadjusted survival difference between patients with, and without, MLN examination, and Cox proportional hazards and competing risk models to serially adjust for the impact of risk factors on survival differences. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of patients with pathologic N0 or N1 NSCLC had no MLN examined. Overall 5-year survival rates were 52% for those with, versus 47% for those without, MLN examination; lung cancer-specific survival rates were 63% versus 58% respectively (p < 0.001); nonlung cancer mortality was identical between cohorts. Adjusting for potential confounders, MLN examination was associated with a 7% reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.93; confidence interval, 0.88-0.97; p = 0.002), and 11% reduction in lung cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.84-0.95; p < 0.001) rates. The excess risk in 1 year's cohort of U.S. lung resections was 3150 lives over 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Failure to examine MLN was a common practice in MLN-negative NSCLC resections, which significantly impaired long-term survival. Efforts to understand the etiology of this quality gap, and measures to eliminate it, are warranted.

Abstract:In previous studies we showed that tick saliva modulates the migratory activity of cells involved in the wound healing response. Since cell migration is a prerequisite for tumor invasion and metastasis, we examined the effects of tick saliva on the migratory and invasive activity of Saos-2 osteosarcoma and MDA-MB-231 (MB-231) breast cancer cells and the potential signaling pathways that may be affected. Saliva inhibited basal and agonist-induced Saos-2 and MB-231 migration and invasion through a matrigel-coated filter. In the Saos-2 cells, saliva suppressed epidermal growth factor (EGF)-activation of Akt/Protein Kinase B, however, only basal extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity was affected in MB-231 cells. EGF receptor (EGFR) overexpression masked the effect of saliva on MB-231 cells, but its ability to inhibit MB-231 migration was enhanced by the EGFR inhibitor PD 168393 and MEK inhibitor U0126. Our data indicate that the mechanisms ticks have evolved to regulate the wound healing response have generalized effects on the migratory and invasive activities of metastatic cancer cells.

Title:An empirical Bayes approach for analysis of diverse periodic trends in time-course gene expression data.

Abstract:MOTIVATION: There is a substantial body of works in the biology literature that seeks to characterize the cyclic behavior of genes during cell division. Gene expression microarrays made it possible to measure the expression profiles of thousands of genes simultaneously in time-course experiments to assess changes in the expression levels of genes over time. In this context, the commonly used procedures for testing include the permutation test by de Lichtenberg et al. and the Fisher's G-test, both of which are designed to evaluate periodicity against noise. However, it is possible that a gene of interest may have expression that is neither cyclic nor just noise. Thus, there is a need for a new test for periodicity that can identify cyclic patterns against not only noise but also other non-cyclic patterns such as linear, quadratic or higher order polynomial patterns. RESULTS: To address this weakness, we have introduced an empirical Bayes approach to test for periodicity and compare its performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity with that of the permutation test and Fisher's G-test through extensive simulations and by application to a set of time-course experiments on the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell-cycle gene expression. We use 'conserved' and 'cycling' genes by Lu et al. to assess the sensitivity and CESR genes by Chenet al. to assess the specificity of our new empirical Bayes method. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The SAS Macro for our empirical Bayes test for periodicity is included in the supplementary materials along with a sample run of the MACRO program.

Abstract:Biophysical characteristics of tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium (Na(+)) currents were studied in vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) supraoptic neurons acutely isolated from rat hypothalamus. Na(+) current density (pA/pF) was significantly greater in VP neurons than in OT neurons. No significant difference between VP and OT neurons was detected regarding the voltage dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation, or rate of recovery from inactivation of Na(+) currents. In both VP and OT neurons, the macroscopic inactivation of the Na(+) currents was best fitted with a double-exponential expression suggesting two rates of inactivation. Also in both types, the time course of recovery from inactivation proceeded with fast and slow time constants averaging around 8 and 350 ms, respectively, suggesting the presence of multiple pathways of recovery from inactivation. The slower time constant of recovery of inactivation may be involved in the decrease in action potential (AP) amplitude that occurs after the first spike during burst firing in both neuronal types. The larger amplitude of Na(+) currents in VP vs. OT neurons may explain the previous observations that VP neurons exhibit a lower AP threshold and greater AP amplitude than OT neurons, and may serve to differently tune the firing properties and responses to neuromodulators of the respective neuronal types.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES: To examine the perceptual structure of voice attributes in adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD) before and after botulinum toxin treatment and identify acoustic correlates of underlying perceptual factors. Reliability of perceptual judgments is considered in detail. STUDY DESIGN: Pre- and posttreatment trial with comparison to healthy controls, using single-blind randomized listener judgments of voice qualities, as well as retrospective comparison with acoustic measurements. METHODS: Oral readings were recorded from 42 ADSD speakers before and after treatment as well as from their age- and sex-matched controls. Experienced judges listened to speech samples and rated attributes of overall voice quality, breathiness, roughness, and brokenness, using computer-implemented visual analog scaling. Data were adjusted for regression to the mean and submitted to principal components factor analysis. Acoustic waveforms, extracted from the reading samples, were analyzed and measurements correlated with perceptual factor scores. RESULTS: Four reliable perceptual variables of ADSD voice were effectively reduced to two underlying factors that corresponded to hyperadduction, most strongly associated with roughness, and hypoadduction, most strongly associated with breathiness. After treatment, the hyperadduction factor improved, whereas the hypoadduction factor worsened. Statistically significant (P<0.01) correlations were observed between perceived roughness and four acoustic measures, whereas breathiness correlated with aperiodicity and cepstral peak prominence (CPPs). CONCLUSIONS: This study supported a two-factor model of ADSD, suggesting perceptual characterization by both hyperadduction and hypoadduction before and after treatment. Responses of the factors to treatment were consistent with previous research. Correlations among perceptual and acoustic variables suggested that multiple acoustic features contributed to the overall impression of roughness. Although CPPs appears to be a partial correlate of perceived breathiness, a physical basis of this percept remained less clear.

Abstract:The current U.S. Navy Physical Readiness Test (PRT) measures aerobic fitness and muscular endurance via a 1 1/2 mile run and curl-up/push-up tests, respectively. Nine new modalities were recommended to either replace or supplement the current PRT. Personnel and civilians (N = 179) were recruited from a local Navy base and participated in all modalities (duplicate if possible) over 4 weeks following familiarization sessions. Subjects performed single-leg plank, single-leg wall squat, cadence push-ups, leg/hip dynamometer, standing long jump, and pro-agility test. Cardiovascular modalities were also performed via the 300-yard shuttle, 2-km row, and 5-km bike. Performance in the modalities was correlated to the subjects' existing PRT scores as well as within the new modalities. Although most modalities could not be concretely recommended, the plank and wall squat were eliminated from consideration because of poor reliability scores. The strongest correlation existed between the standing long jump and pro-agility test for the entire sample. Correlation scores were also analyzed by gender. The cardiovascular modalities did not have strong enough scores to elicit a recommendation to replace the 1 1/2 mile run, but future considerations for similar testing would be to collect scores for the existing modalities in addition to the proposed modalities.

Abstract:Little is known about molecular recognition of acetylated N termini, despite prevalence of this modification among eukaryotic cytosolic proteins. We report that the family of human DCN-like (DCNL) co-E3s, which promote ligation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to cullin targets, recognizes acetylated N termini of the E2 enzymes UBC12 and UBE2F. Systematic biochemical and biophysical analyses reveal 40- and 10-fold variations in affinities among different DCNL-cullin and DCNL-E2 complexes, contributing to varying efficiencies of different NEDD8 ligation cascades. Structures of DCNL2 and DCNL3 complexes with N-terminally acetylated peptides from UBC12 and UBE2F illuminate a common mechanism by which DCNL proteins recognize N-terminally acetylated E2s and how selectivity for interactions dependent on N-acetyl-methionine are established through side chains recognizing distal residues. Distinct preferences of UBC12 and UBE2F peptides for inhibiting different DCNLs, including the oncogenic DCNL1 protein, suggest it may be possible to develop small molecules blocking specific N-acetyl-methionine-dependent protein interactions.

Title:Uneven magnitude of disparities in cancer risks from air toxics.
Authors:['James W', 'Jia C', 'Kedia S']
Affiliation:Department of Sociology, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA. wljames1@memphis.edu
Abstract:This study examines race- and income-based disparities in cancer risks from air toxics in Cancer Alley, LA, USA. Risk estimates were obtained from the 2005 National Air Toxics Assessment and socioeconomic and race data from the 2005 American Community Survey, both at the census tract level. Disparities were assessed using spatially weighted ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and quantile regression (QR) for five major air toxics, each with cancer risk greater than 10(-6). Spatial OLS results showed that disparities in cancer risks were significant: People in low-income tracts bore a cumulative risk 12% more than those in high-income tracts (p < 0.05), and those in black-dominant areas 16% more than in white-dominant areas (p < 0.01). Formaldehyde and benzene were the two largest contributors to the disparities. Contributions from emission sources to disparities varied by compound. Spatial QR analyses showed that magnitude of disparity became larger at the high end of exposure range, indicating worsened disparity in the poorest and most highly concentrated black areas. Cancer risk of air toxics not only disproportionately affects socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial minority communities, but there is a gradient effect within these groups with poorer and higher minority concentrated segments being more affected than their counterparts. Risk reduction strategies should target emission sources, risk driver chemicals, and especially the disadvantaged neighborhoods.

Title:Analysis and Confirmation of 1,3-DMAA and 1,4-DMAA in Geranium Plants Using High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry at ng/g Concentrations.
Authors:['Fleming HL', 'Ranaivo PL', 'Simone PS']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:1,3-Dimethylamylamine (1,3-DMAA) is a stimulant commercially sold in a variety of dietary supplements as a chemical species derived from geranium plants (Pelargonium graveolens). Whether 1,3-DMAA naturally occurs in geranium plants or other dietary ingredients, it has important regulatory and commercial ramifications. However, the analysis of 1,3-DMAA in geranium plants is not trivial due to low concentrations and a complex environmental matrix, requiring high selectivity and sensitivity. An extraction method combined with high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry is used to determine 1,3-DMAA and 1,4-dimethylamylamine (1,4-DMAA) concentrations in geranium plants with both external calibration and standard addition method. Samples from the Changzhou, Kunming, and Guiyang regions of China during both winter and summer were analyzed for 1,3-DMAA and 1,4-DMAA. The diastereomer ratios of the 1,3-DMAA stereoisomers of a racemic standard and the extracted plant were also quantified.

Title:Pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors regulate signaling pathways involved in proliferative and pro-inflammatory mechanisms in H9c2 cells.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: We have shown previously that pan-HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs) m-carboxycinnamic acid bis-hydroxamide (CBHA) and trichostatin A (TSA) attenuated cardiac hypertrophy in BALB/c mice by inducing hyper-acetylation of cardiac chromatin that was accompanied by suppression of pro-inflammatory gene networks. However, it was not feasible to determine the precise contribution of the myocytes- and non-myocytes to HDACI-induced gene expression in the intact heart. Therefore, the current study was undertaken with a primary goal of elucidating temporal changes in the transcriptomes of cardiac myocytes exposed to CBHA and TSA. RESULTS: We incubated H9c2 cardiac myocytes in growth medium containing either of the two HDACIs for 6h and 24h and analyzed changes in gene expression using Illumina microarrays. H9c2 cells exposed to TSA for 6h and 24h led to differential expression of 468 and 231 genes, respectively. In contrast, cardiac myocytes incubated with CBHA for 6h and 24h elicited differential expression of 768 and 999 genes, respectively. We analyzed CBHA- and TSA-induced differentially expressed genes by Ingenuity Pathway (IPA), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Core_TF programs and discovered that CBHA and TSA impinged on several common gene networks. Thus, both HDACIs induced a repertoire of signaling kinases (PTEN-PI3K-AKT and MAPK) and transcription factors (Myc, p53, NFkB and HNF4A) representing canonical TGFbeta, TNF-alpha, IFNgamma and IL-6 specific networks. An overrepresentation of E2F, AP2, EGR1 and SP1 specific motifs was also found in the promoters of the differentially expressed genes. Apparently, TSA elicited predominantly TGFbeta- and TNF-alpha-intensive gene networks regardless of the duration of treatment. In contrast, CBHA elicited TNF-alpha and IFNgamma specific networks at 6 h, followed by elicitation of IL-6 and IFNgamma-centered gene networks at 24h. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that both CBHA and TSA induced similar, but not identical, time-dependent, gene networks in H9c2 cardiac myocytes. Initially, both HDACIs impinged on numerous genes associated with adipokine signaling, intracellular metabolism and energetics, and cell cycle. A continued exposure to either CBHA or TSA led to the emergence of a number of apoptosis- and inflammation-specific gene networks that were apparently suppressed by both HDACIs. Based on these data we posit that the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative actions of HDACIs are myocyte-intrinsic. These findings advance our understanding of the mechanisms of actions of HDACIs on cardiac myocytes and reveal potential signaling pathways that may be targeted therapeutically.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Aerogels are a versatile group of nanostructured/nanoporous materials with physical and chemical properties that can be adjusted to suit the application of interest. In terms of biomedical applications, aerogels are particularly suitable for implants such as membranes, tissue growth scaffolds, and nerve regeneration and guidance inserts. The mesoporous nature of aerogels can also be used for diffusion based release of drugs that are loaded during the drying stage of the material. From the variety of aerogels polyurea crosslinked silica aerogels have the most potential for future biomedical applications and are explored here. METHODOLOGY: This study assessed the short and long term biocompatibility of polyurea crosslinked silica aerogel implants in a Sprague-Dawley rat model. Implants were inserted at two different locations a) subcutaneously (SC), at the dorsum and b) intramuscularly (IM), between the gluteus maximus and biceps femoris of the left hind extremity. Nearby muscle and other internal organs were evaluated histologically for inflammation, tissue damage, fibrosis and movement (travel) of implant. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: In general polyurea crosslinked silica aerogel (PCSA) was well tolerated as a subcutaneous and an intramuscular implant in the Sprague-Dawley rat with a maximum incubation time of twenty months. In some cases a thin fibrous capsule surrounded the aerogel implant and was interpreted as a normal response to foreign material. No noticeable toxicity was found in the tissues surrounding the implants nor in distant organs. Comparison was made with control rats without any implants inserted, and animals with suture material present. No obvious or noticeable changes were sustained by the implants at either location. Careful necropsy and tissue histology showed age-related changes only. An effective sterilization technique for PCSA implants as well as staining and sectioning protocol has been established. These studies further support the notion that silica-based aerogels could be useful as biomaterials.

Title:The impact of elevated posttraumatic stress on the efficacy of brief alcohol interventions for heavy drinking college students.

Abstract:Brief alcohol interventions (BAIs) have been widely adopted for use with college students and are associated with significant reductions in drinking and problems. However, many students do not respond to these approaches and little is known about risk factors for poor response. The current study investigated one possible risk factor by examining the impact of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms on BAI efficacy. This study presents pooled data from two randomized clinical trials that examined the efficacy of counselor-administered BAIs compared with computerized interventions. Participants were 207 college students (53.1% women, 68.1% White/Caucasian, 16.9% with elevated post-traumatic stress) who reported past-month heavy episodic drinking. Follow-up assessments were completed six months post-intervention. Analyses testing differences in frequency of past-month heavy episodic drinking revealed a significant post-traumatic stress by time interaction (F(1,165)=8.27, p=.005) such that individuals screening positive for PTS showed larger reductions in heavy episodic drinking at follow-up. A significant three-way interaction between time, PTS, and intervention condition (F(2,167)=5.76, p=.004) was found for alcohol related consequences. Specifically, among individuals screening positive for PTS, only those that received the counselor-administered BAI showed a significant reduction in consequences at follow-up. These results suggest that overall college students with PTS may respond well to BAIs and that counselor-delivered BAIs may be more efficacious than computer-delivered interventions for reducing alcohol problems for these high-risk students.

Abstract:The U.S. Spanish-speaking population has rapidly increased in recent decades and there is a need for psychometrically supported assessment measures for researchers and clinicians who work with this population. A Spanish version of a self-report measure of gamblers' cognitive distortions [Gamblers' Beliefs Questionnaire (GBQ); Steenbergh, Meyers, Whelan, & May, 2002] was translated and psychometrically evaluated in a sample of 219 Spanish-speaking Hispanics residing in the southeast United States. The GBQ-S showed high internal consistency (alpha = .95). Factor analytic data supported a factor structure similar to the initial psychometric evaluation of the English version. Probable pathological gamblers reported significantly more cognitive distortions on the GBQ-S than nongamblers and nonpathological gamblers.

Title:Literature aided determination of data quality and statistical significance threshold for gene expression studies.
Authors:['Xu L', 'Cheng C', 'George EO', 'Homayouni R']
Affiliation:Bioinformatics Program, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Gene expression data are noisy due to technical and biological variability. Consequently, analysis of gene expression data is complex. Different statistical methods produce distinct sets of genes. In addition, selection of expression p-value (EPv) threshold is somewhat arbitrary. In this study, we aimed to develop novel literature based approaches to integrate functional information in analysis of gene expression data. METHODS: Functional relationships between genes were derived by Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) of Medline abstracts and used to calculate the function cohesion of gene sets. In this study, literature cohesion was applied in two ways. First, Literature-Based Functional Significance (LBFS) method was developed to calculate a p-value for the cohesion of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in order to objectively evaluate the overall biological significance of the gene expression experiments. Second, Literature Aided Statistical Significance Threshold (LASST) was developed to determine the appropriate expression p-value threshold for a given experiment. RESULTS: We tested our methods on three different publicly available datasets. LBFS analysis demonstrated that only two experiments were significantly cohesive. For each experiment, we also compared the LBFS values of DEGs generated by four different statistical methods. We found that some statistical tests produced more functionally cohesive gene sets than others. However, no statistical test was consistently better for all experiments. This reemphasizes that a statistical test must be carefully selected for each expression study. Moreover, LASST analysis demonstrated that the expression p-value thresholds for some experiments were considerably lower (p < 0.02 and 0.01), suggesting that the arbitrary p-values and false discovery rate thresholds that are commonly used in expression studies may not be biologically sound. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed robust and objective literature-based methods to evaluate the biological support for gene expression experiments and to determine the appropriate statistical significance threshold. These methods will assist investigators to more efficiently extract biologically meaningful insights from high throughput gene expression experiments.

Abstract:Mind wandering is a phenomenon in which attention drifts away from the primary task to task-unrelated thoughts. Previous studies have used self-report methods to measure the frequency of mind wandering and its effects on task performance. Many of these studies have investigated mind wandering in simple perceptual and memory tasks, such as recognition memory, sustained attention, and choice reaction time tasks. Manipulations of task difficulty have revealed that mind wandering occurs more frequently in easy than in difficult conditions, but that it has a greater negative impact on performance in the difficult conditions. The goal of this study was to examine the relation between mind wandering and task difficulty in a high-level cognitive task, namely reading comprehension of standardized texts. We hypothesized that reading comprehension may yield a different relation between mind wandering and task difficulty than has been observed previously. Participants read easy or difficult versions of eight passages and then answered comprehension questions after reading each of the passages. Mind wandering was reported using the probe-caught method from several previous studies. In contrast to the previous results, but consistent with our hypothesis, mind wandering occurred more frequently when participants read difficult rather than easy texts. However, mind wandering had a more negative influence on comprehension for the difficult texts, which is consistent with the previous data. The results are interpreted from the perspectives of the executive-resources and control-failure theories of mind wandering, as well as with regard to situation models of text comprehension.

Abstract:Opioid and tachykinin neuropeptides, which were derived from two biological sources (intact, and released from their corresponding precursors by the action of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neuropeptidases), were characterized in human CSF by using a combination of post-high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) detection techniques. Peptides were separated using gradient and isocratic reversed-phase HPLC. Radioimmunoassay measured immunoreactivity corresponding to several different individual neuropeptides including methionine enkephalin, leucine enkephalin, substance P and beta-endorphin. Commercial enzymes (trypsin, carboxypeptidase B) were used to release methionine- and leucine-enkephalin from precursors. Human CSF also served as a source of endogenous neuropeptidases. Mass spectrometry produced fragment ions that corroborated the amino acid sequence of methionine enkephalin and of substance P derived from both sources (intact, from precursors). These results demonstrated the presence of endogenous intact neuropeptides, several different neuropeptide-containing precursors and appropriate precursor-processing enzymes in human CSF for precursors of methionine enkephalin, leucine enkephalin, beta-endorphin1-31 and substance P.

Abstract:CONTEXT: There is no effective treatment for systemic sclerosis and related fibrosing diseases. Recently the action of CYP11A1 on vitamin D(3) was shown to produce biologically active 20S-hydroxyvitamin D [20(OH)D(3)] and 20,23(OH)(2)D(3), 20,22(OH)(2)D(3), and 17,20,23(OH)(3)D(3). OBJECTIVES: Because 20(OH)D(3) is noncalcemic (nontoxic) in vivo at very high doses, we evaluated its antifibrogenic activities both in vitro and in vivo. Because it is further metabolized by CYP11A1, we also tested preclinical utilities of its hydroxyderivatives, especially 20,23(OH)(2)D(3). DESIGN: Human dermal fibroblasts from scleroderma and normal donors were used to test the efficiency of hydroxyvitamin D derivatives in inhibiting TGF-beta1-induced collagen and hyaluronan synthesis and inhibiting cell proliferation. The in vivo activity of 20(OH)D(3) was tested using bleomycin-induced sclerosis in C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: 20(OH)D(3) and 20,23(OH)(2)D(3) inhibited TGF-beta1-induced collagen and hyaluronan synthesis similarly to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in cultured human fibroblasts. Also, 20(OH)D(3), 20,23(OH)(2)D(3), and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) suppressed TGF-beta1-induced expression of COL1A2, COL3A1, and hyaluronan synthase-2 mRNA, indicating that they regulate these matrix components at the transcriptional level. 20(OH)D(3), 20,23(OH)(2)D(3), 20,22(OH)(2)D(3), and 17,20,23(OH)(3)D(3) inhibited proliferation of dermal fibroblasts with comparable potency with 1,25(OH)(2)D(3), with 20(OH)D(2) being less active and 1alpha(OH)D(3) being almost inactive. 20,23(OH)(2)D(3) at 3 mug/kg had no effect on serum Ca(++) or fibroblast growth factor-23 levels and did not cause any noticeable signs of morbidity. 20(OH)D(3) markedly suppressed fibrogenesis in mice given sc bleomycin as demonstrated by total collagen content and hematoxylin and eosin staining of skin biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: 20(OH)D(3) is an excellent candidate for preclinical studies on scleroderma, with other CYP11A1-derived products of its metabolism deserving further testing for antibrogenic activity.

Title:Blood pressure increases, birth weight-dependent stability boundary, and intraventricular hemorrhage.

Abstract:The blood pressure (BP) and transcutaneous PO2 (TcPO2) changes associated with intensive care procedures were evaluated to determine whether responses differ between babies with and without periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (PV-IVH). Fifty-three inborn babies less than or equal to 1500 g were studied using a microcomputer-based monitoring system. With almost any procedure including a seemingly benign one such as a diaper change, peak systolic BP increased and TcPO2 decreased. However, responses to interventions did not differ between babies with PV-IVH and those without PV-IVH. Neither did these responses differ between those with birth weight less than or equal to 1000 g and greater than 1000 g. When each baby's record was scanned for the highest peak systolic BP before diagnosis of PV-IVH or within 48 hours in those with no PV-IVH and their BP points plotted against birth weight, a stable region was evident wherein PV-IVH occurred at a lower incidence (13%). When peak systolic BP was beyond this stable region, the incidence of PV-IVH was significantly higher, 70% (P less than .0001). The stability boundary for the maximum systolic BP is birth weight-dependent; the limit for the highest tolerable peak systolic BP is lower for the low-birth-weight infant. In over 70% of instances the highest peak systolic BP was associated with motor activities either induced by nursery procedures or spontaneous. We speculate that decreasing the frequency of intensive care interventions may decrease episodic BP increases to levels beyond the birth weight-dependent stability boundary where PV-IVH is likely to occur.

Title:Acute plasma volume change with high-intensity sprint exercise.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ', 'Farney TM']
Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, Department of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee.
Abstract:When exercise is of long duration or of moderate to high intensity, a decrease in plasma volume can be observed. This has been noted for both aerobic and resistance exercise, but few data are available with regard to high-intensity sprint exercise. We measured plasma volume before and after 3 different bouts of acute exercise, of varying intensity, and/or duration. On different days, men (n = 12; 21-35 years) performed aerobic cycle exercise (60 minutes at 70% heart rate reserve) and 2 different bouts of cycle sprints (five 60-second sprints at 100% maximum wattage obtained during graded exercise testing (GXT) and ten 15-second sprints at 200% maximum wattage obtained during GXT). Blood was collected before and 0, 30, and 60 minutes postexercise and analyzed for hematocrit and hemoglobin and plasma volume was calculated. Plasma volume decreased significantly for all exercise bouts (p < 0.05), with the greatest decrease noted 0 minute postexercise for both sprint bouts ( approximately 19%) compared with aerobic exercise bouts ( approximately 11%). By 30 minutes postexercise, plasma volume approached pre-exercise values. We conclude that acute bouts of exercise, in particular high-intensity sprint exercise, significantly decrease plasma volume during the immediate postexercise period. It is unknown what, if any negative implications these transient changes may have on exercise performance. Strength and conditioning professionals may aim to rehydrate athletes appropriately after high-intensity exercise bouts.

Abstract:Organic modified silica sol was prepared by using (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)trimethoxysilane (TFPTMS) as a precursor in ethanol solution under acidic condition. Infrared and Raman spectra were recorded for the silane coupling agent (SCA), TFPTMS sol and xerogel. Vibrational assignments have been suggested based on the spectral relative intensity, results from the vibrational study of trimethoxypropylsilane (TMPS), similar trifluorocompounds and group frequencies. Low temperature IR spectra revealed the presence of two conformers in TFPTMS. Only one conformer could be identified in the TFPTMS sol and xerogel. Thermal investigation of TFPTMS xerogel with infrared spectroscopic method indicated that the organic part remained essentially unchanged at or below 350 degrees C but decomposed at or around 450 degrees C, in agreement with the result from thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). After the decomposition of the organic branch, the remaining part of the xerogel was composed of silica.

Title:Effects of a waking schedule on primary enuretic children treated with full-spectrum home training.
Authors:['Whelan JP', 'Houts AC']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Examined the effects of adding a waking schedule to full-spectrum home training (FSHT) for primary enuresis. Twenty children received FSHT, and 17 children received FSHT plus a waking schedule. The groups did not reliably differ in average bedwettings per week in treatment and length of treatment. Also, the groups did not reliably differ with respect to proportion of treatment successes and proportion of relapses at 1-year follow-up. Further, across both treatment groups, 76% achieved a dry bed, and only 16% experienced a relapse by 1-year follow-up. Although results support the efficacy of FSHT, the beneficial effects of a waking schedule reported previously were not replicated. The findings suggest the need for closer examination of individual differences among children with primary nocturnal enuresis.

Title:Dab2IP GTPase activating protein regulates dendrite development and synapse number in cerebellum.
Authors:['Qiao S', 'Kim SH', 'Heck D', 'Goldowitz D', 'LeDoux MS', 'Homayouni R']
Affiliation:Department of Biological Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America.
Abstract:DOC-2/DAB-2 interacting protein (Dab2IP) is a GTPase activating protein that binds to Disabled-1, a cytosolic adapter protein involved in Reelin signaling and brain development. Dab2IP regulates PI3K-AKT signaling and is associated with metastatic prostate cancer, abdominal aortic aneurysms and coronary heart disease. To date, the physiological function of Dab2IP in the nervous system, where it is highly expressed, is relatively unknown. In this study, we generated a mouse model with a targeted disruption of Dab2IP using a retrovirus gene trap strategy. Unlike reeler mice, Dab2IP knock-down mice did not exhibit severe ataxia or cerebellar hypoplasia. However, Dab2IP deficiency produced a number of cerebellar abnormalities such as a delay in the development of Purkinje cell (PC) dendrites, a decrease in the parallel fiber synaptic marker VGluT1, and an increase in the climbing fiber synaptic marker VGluT2. These findings demonstrate for the first time that Dab2IP plays an important role in dendrite development and regulates the number of synapses in the cerebellum.

Abstract:Ion-selective potentiometry enjoys practical utility as a simple analytical technique to measure ionic constituents in complex samples. Advances in the field have improved the selectivity and decreased the detection limit of ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) by orders of magnitude such that trace analysis in micro and nanomolar concentrations is now possible with potentiometric sensors. This tutorial reviews the fundamental principles of ion-selective potentiometry, describes the practical considerations involved in the use of these sensors to measure real samples, and discusses the statistical evaluation of experimental results compared with alternative analytical techniques.

Title:Centrosomes in the zebrafish (Danio rerio): a review including the related basal body.
Authors:['Lessman CA']
Affiliation:Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Memphis, Life Sciences 223, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. Clessman@memphis.edu.
Abstract:Ever since Edouard Van Beneden and Theodor Boveri first formally described the centrosome in the late 1800s, it has captivated cell biologists. The name clearly indicated its central importance to cell functioning, even to these early investigators. We now know of its role as a major microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) and of its dynamic roles in cell division, vesicle trafficking and for its relative, the basal body, ciliogenesis. While centrosomes are found in most animal cells, notably it is absent in most oocytes and higher plant cells. Nevertheless, it appears that critical components of the centrosome act as MTOCs in these cells as well. The zebrafish has emerged as an exciting and promising new model organism, primarily due to the pioneering efforts of George Streisinger to use zebrafish in genetic studies and due to Christiane Nusslein-Volhard, Wolfgang Driever and their teams of collaborators, who applied forward genetics to elicit a large number of mutant lines. The transparency and rapid external development of the embryo allow for experiments not easily done in other vertebrates. The ease of producing transgenic lines, often with the use of fluorescent reporters, and gene knockdowns with antisense morpholinos further contributes to the appeal of the model as an experimental system. The added advantage of high-throughput screening of small-molecule libraries, as well as the ease of mass rearing together with low cost, makes the zebrafish a true frontrunner as a model vertebrate organism. The zebrafish has a body plan shared by all vertebrates, including humans. This conservation of body plan provides added significance to the existing lines of zebrafish as human disease models and adds an impetus to the ongoing efforts to develop new models. In this review, the current state of knowledge about the centrosome in the zebrafish model is explored. Also, studies on the related basal body in zebrafish and their relationship to ciliogenesis are reviewed.

Title:Multiscale adaptive generalized estimating equations for longitudinal neuroimaging data.

Abstract:Many large-scale longitudinal imaging studies have been or are being widely conducted to better understand the progress of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and normal brain development. The goal of this article is to develop a multiscale adaptive generalized estimation equation (MAGEE) method for spatial and adaptive analysis of neuroimaging data from longitudinal studies. MAGEE is applicable to making statistical inference on regression coefficients in both balanced and unbalanced longitudinal designs and even in twin and familial studies, whereas standard software platforms have several major limitations in handling these complex studies. Specifically, conventional voxel-based analyses in these software platforms involve Gaussian smoothing imaging data and then independently fitting a statistical model at each voxel. However, the conventional smoothing methods suffer from the lack of spatial adaptivity to the shape and spatial extent of region of interest and the arbitrary choice of smoothing extent, while independently fitting statistical models across voxels does not account for the spatial properties of imaging observations and noise distribution. To address such drawbacks, we adapt a powerful propagation-separation (PS) procedure to sequentially incorporate the neighboring information of each voxel and develop a new novel strategy to solely update a set of parameters of interest, while fixing other nuisance parameters at their initial estimators. Simulation studies and real data analysis show that MAGEE significantly outperforms voxel-based analysis.

Title:Fabrication of crosslinked carboxymethylchitosan microspheres and their incorporation into composite scaffolds for enhanced bone regeneration.
Authors:['Reves BT', 'Bumgardner JD', 'Haggard WO']
Affiliation:Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:Carboxymethylchitosan (CMCS) microspheres were prepared by the carboxymethylation of chitosan (CS) beads using monochloroacetic acid. The CMCS microspheres were crosslinked using two different methods: the amine-amine crosslinker genipin and carbodiimide chemistry, yielding Gen-X CMCS and X-CMCS beads, respectively. The Gen-X CMCS beads were found to have poor degradation and drug release profiles. The X-CMCS microspheres displayed good potential for use in tissue engineering applications in which degradation and local drug delivery are desired. The X-CMCS beads displayed enzymatic degradation of 82.7 +/- 1.2% in 100 mug/mL lysozyme after 1 month. An extended release of rhBMP-2 for at least 45 days was also observed with the X-CMCS microspheres. Scaffolds were formed by fusing beads together, and the X-CMCS beads were successfully incorporated into composite X-CMCS/CS scaffolds. The composite scaffolds had increased degradation of 14.5 +/- 6.6% compared to 0.5 +/- 0.4% for CS-only scaffolds, and the X-CMCS/CS scaffolds released more rhBMP-2 at all timepoints. The composite scaffolds also supported the attachment and proliferation of SAOS-2 cells. The addition of X-CMCS beads resulted in fabrication of scaffolds with improved properties for use in bone tissue engineering.

Abstract:Nanotechnology-based photothermal therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for cancer during the past decade. However, heterogeneous laser heating and limited light penetration can lead to incomplete tumor cell eradication. Here, we developed a method to overcome these limitations by combining chemotherapy with photothermal therapy using paclitaxel-loaded gold nanorods. Paclitaxel was loaded to gold nanorods with high density (2.0 x 10(4) paclitaxel per gold nanorod) via nonspecific adsorption, followed by stabilization with poly(ethylene glycol) linked with 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid. Paclitaxel was entrapped in the hydrophobic pocket of the polymeric monolayer on the surface of gold nanorods, which allows direct cellular delivery of the hydrophobic drugs via the lipophilic plasma membrane. Highly efficient drug release was demonstrated in a cell membrane mimicking two-phase solution. Combined photothermal therapy and chemotherapy with the paclitaxel-loaded gold nanorods was shown to be highly effective in killing head and neck cancer cells and lung cancer cells, superior to photothermal therapy or chemotherapy alone due to a synergistic effect. The paclitaxel-gold nanorod enabled photothermal chemotherapy has the potential of preventing tumor reoccurrence and metastasis and may have an important impact on the treatment of head and neck cancer and other malignancies in the clinic.

Title:Prenatal gastrointestinal development in the pig and responses after preterm birth.
Authors:['Buddington RK', 'Sangild PT', 'Hance B', 'Huang EY', 'Black DD']
Affiliation:Department of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38117, USA. rbddngtn@memphis.edu
Abstract:Despite clinical research and medical advances, care of the preterm infant remains a clinical challenge, with the immature gastrointestinal (GI) system limiting the types and amounts of nutrients that can be provided enterally to meet energy and nutrient requirements. Progress in understanding the relationship between dietary inputs and the developing GI system after preterm birth has been limited by ethical constraints of using preterm infants as experimental subjects and a lack of relevant animal models. We review development of the GI system of the pig during gestation, the similarities shared with human fetuses, and the responses to dietary stimuli. The GI systems of pigs and humans develop early in gestation, with growth and maturation accelerating during the final weeks prior to birth. As a consequence, deficits in GI digestive capacities are directly related to how early in gestation an infant or pig is delivered, thereby complicating attempts to provide adequate enteral nutrients for growth and development. Pigs differ from humans by being born with low activities of the brush border membrane carbohydrases necessary for hydrolysis of nonlactose carbohydrates. Fetuses of both species have impaired lipid digestion coinciding with lipid malabsorption after preterm birth. Protease activity, although present, may not be adequate and may limit growth potential. Undigested enteral inputs are available to the resident bacteria and the production of metabolites can influence health and nutrition. The preterm pig represents a relevant and translational animal model for understanding GI development and for identifying diet and regulatory factors that stimulate GI growth and maturation after preterm birth and thereby accelerate the transition from parenteral nutrition to full enteral nutrition.

Title:High-fat feeding, but not strenuous exercise, increases blood oxidative stress in trained men.

Abstract:Two prevalent origins of oxidative stress in Western society are the ingestion of high-fat meals and the performance of strenuous exercise. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the magnitude of increase in blood oxidative stress following acute feeding and acute exercise. Twelve exercise-trained men consumed a high-fat meal or performed 1 of 3 exercise bouts (steady-state aerobic; high-intensity, moderate-duration interval sprints; maximal intensity, short-duration interval sprints) in a random order, crossover design. Blood was collected before and at times following feeding and exercise. Samples were analyzed for trigylcerides, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), nitrate/nitrite (NOx), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). A significant condition effect was noted for MDA (p = 0.01), H(2)O(2) (p < 0.0001), and AOPP (p = 0.0006), with values highest for the meal condition. An increase of 88%, 247%, and 96% was noted from pre- to post-feeding for MDA, H(2)O(2), and AOPP, respectively. A condition effect was also noted for TEAC (p = 0.04) and CAT (p = 0.05), with values lowest for the meal condition (TEAC) and the meal and aerobic exercise condition (CAT). NOx, SOD, and GPx were relatively unaffected by feeding and exercise, while MDA, H(2)O(2), and AOPP experienced little change from pre- to postexercise (p > 0.05). These results illustrate that the magnitude of blood oxidative stress following a high-fat meal is significantly greater than that elicited by either aerobic or anaerobic exercise in a sample of exercise-trained men.

Abstract:Health information exchange holds the promise of sharing critical information about patients across organizations. We have found that emergency nurses have little or no involvement in using health information exchange and, often, they are not granted access by individual hospital policies. Yet, emergency nurses need to know this information and must have full access to health information exchange. We provide recommendations to ensure that emergency nurses are able to reach their full potential in using health information exchange to care for patients.

Title:A patient-centric goal in time to blood pressure control from drug therapy initiation.
Authors:['Hong SH', 'Wang J', 'Tak S']
Affiliation:University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Pharmacy, Memphis, TN, USA. shhong@uthsc.edu
Abstract:A time frame in which newly diagnosed hypertensive patients attain blood pressure (BP) goal would guide patients through uncertainty associated with initiating drug therapy for hypertension control. This study estimates time to BP goal resulting from drug therapy initiation among real-world hypertensive patients and identifies factors associated with variations in time to BP goal. The study uses a historical cohort design. Hypertensive patients who had initiated antihypertensive drug therapy between July 1, 2002, and December 31, 2003, were followed up to 12 months until the end of 2004. Electronic medical records from a medical group were linked with pharmacy claims, as well as with medical claims. Survival analyses were used to compare lengths of time needed to reach BP goals. A total of 223 patients from a real world practice setting had initiated antihypertensive drug therapy. The patients took 3.25 months (95% CI: 2.49-4.82) to reach BP goal. The patient-centric time to BP goal was 7.1 weeks longer than those reported in controlled experimental settings. This finding highlights the gap between results of controlled clinical trials and their application to clinical practice, and informs healthcare practitioners of the importance of setting a patient-centric goal in pharmacological treatment of hypertension.

Abstract:Caffeine and 1,3-dimethylamylamine (DMAA) are widely used alone and in combination with dietary supplements. No investigation has determined the safety profile of chronic intake of caffeine or DMAA, alone or in combination, within the same study design. A total of 50 young and healthy men completed 12 weeks of daily supplementation with either a placebo (n = 11), caffeine at 250 mg day(-1) (n = 14), DMAA at 50 mg day(-1) (n = 13), or caffeine at 250 mg day(-1) + DMAA at 50 mg day(-1) (n = 12). Before and after 6 and 12 weeks of supplementation, the following variables were measured: body mass/composition, resting respiratory rate, blood pressure, 12-lead electrocardiogram, urinalysis, complete blood count, metabolic panel, lipid panel, and oxidative stress, inflammatory, and cardiac biomarkers. No interaction effects were noted for any variable (p > 0.05), with little change occurring across time for subjects in any of the four conditions. With the exception of urinary pH (p = 0.05; Pre (6.5 +/- 0.1) higher than week 6 (6.1 +/- 0.1)) and blood CO2 (p = 0.02; week 12 (25.9 +/- 0.3 mmol L(-1)) higher than week 6 (24.8 +/- 0.3 mmol L(-1))), no time effect was noted for any other variable (p > 0.05). These data indicate that 12 weeks of daily supplementation with caffeine and DMAA, alone or in combination, does not result in a statistically significant change in any of the measured outcome variables.

Abstract:Imaging, clinical, and pre-clinical studies have provided ample evidence for a cerebellar involvement in cognitive brain function including cognitive brain disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia. We previously reported that cerebellar activity modulates dopamine release in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) via two distinct pathways: (1) cerebellum to mPFC via dopaminergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and (2) cerebellum to mPFC via glutamatergic projections from the mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamus (ThN md and vl). The present study compared functional adaptations of cerebello-cortical circuitry following developmental cerebellar pathology in a mouse model of developmental loss of Purkinje cells (Lurcher) and a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (Fmr1 KO mice). Fixed potential amperometry was used to measure mPFC dopamine release in response to cerebellar electrical stimulation. Mutant mice of both strains showed an attenuation in cerebellar-evoked mPFC dopamine release compared to respective wildtype mice. This was accompanied by a functional reorganization of the VTA and thalamic pathways mediating cerebellar modulation of mPFC dopamine release. Inactivation of the VTA pathway by intra-VTA lidocaine or kynurenate infusions decreased dopamine release by 50 % in wildtype and 20-30 % in mutant mice of both strains. Intra-ThN vl infusions of either drug decreased dopamine release by 15 % in wildtype and 40 % in mutant mice of both strains, while dopamine release remained relatively unchanged following intra-ThN md drug infusions. These results indicate a shift in strength towards the thalamic vl projection, away from the VTA. Thus, cerebellar neuropathologies associated with autism spectrum disorders may cause a reduction in cerebellar modulation of mPFC dopamine release that is related to a reorganization of the mediating neuronal pathways.

Abstract:Previous studies have revealed the significance of cytokine interleukin 1 (IL-1) in the onset and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The precise molecular mechanisms related to IL-1 underlying RA is still elusive. We conducted a whole genome-wide transcriptomal comparison of wild-type (WT) and arthritis-prone IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1rn) deficient BALB/c mice to address this issue. To refine our search efforts, gene expression profiling was also performed on paired wild-type and arthritis-resistant IL-1rn deficient DBA/1 mice as internal controls when identifying causative arthritis candidate genes. Two hundred and fifteen transcripts were found to be dysregulated greater than or equal to 2-fold in the diseased mice. The altered transcriptome in BALB/c mice revealed increased myeloid cell activities and impaired lymphocyte functionality, suggesting dual regulatory effects of IL-1 hyperactivity on immunological changes associated with arthritis development. Phase-specific gene expression changes were identified, such as early increase and late decrease of heat shock protein coding genes. Moreover, common gene expression changes were also observed, especially the upregulation of paired Ig-like receptor A (Pira) in both early and late phases of arthritis. Real-time PCR was performed to validate the expression of Pira and an intervention experiment with a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I inhibitor (brefeldin A) was carried out to investigate the role of suppressing Pira activity. We conclude that global pattern changes of common and distinct gene expressions may represent novel opportunities for better control of RA through early diagnosis and development of alternative therapeutic strategies.

Abstract:Algorithms designed to identify canonical yeast prions predict that around 250 human proteins, including several RNA-binding proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease, harbour a distinctive prion-like domain (PrLD) enriched in uncharged polar amino acids and glycine. PrLDs in RNA-binding proteins are essential for the assembly of ribonucleoprotein granules. However, the interplay between human PrLD function and disease is not understood. Here we define pathogenic mutations in PrLDs of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2B1 and A1 in families with inherited degeneration affecting muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone, and in one case of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Wild-type hnRNPA2 (the most abundant isoform of hnRNPA2B1) and hnRNPA1 show an intrinsic tendency to assemble into self-seeding fibrils, which is exacerbated by the disease mutations. Indeed, the pathogenic mutations strengthen a 'steric zipper' motif in the PrLD, which accelerates the formation of self-seeding fibrils that cross-seed polymerization of wild-type hnRNP. Notably, the disease mutations promote excess incorporation of hnRNPA2 and hnRNPA1 into stress granules and drive the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal models that recapitulate the human pathology. Thus, dysregulated polymerization caused by a potent mutant steric zipper motif in a PrLD can initiate degenerative disease. Related proteins with PrLDs should therefore be considered candidates for initiating and perhaps propagating proteinopathies of muscle, brain, motor neuron and bone.

Title:Differences in brainstem fiber tract response to radiation: a longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging study.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To determine whether radiation-induced changes in white matter tracts are uniform across the brainstem. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We analyzed serial diffusion tensor imaging data, acquired before radiation therapy and over 48 to 72 months of follow-up, from 42 pediatric patients (age 6-20 years) with medulloblastoma. FSL software (FMRIB, Oxford, UK) was used to calculate fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial, radial, and mean diffusivities. For a consistent identification of volumes of interest (VOIs), the parametric maps of each patient were transformed to a standard brain space (MNI152), on which we identified VOIs including corticospinal tract (CST), medial lemniscus (ML), transverse pontine fiber (TPF), and middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) at the level of pons. Temporal changes of DTI parameters in VOIs were compared using a linear mixed effect model. RESULTS: Radiation-induced white matter injury was marked by a decline in FA after treatment. The decline was often accompanied by decreased axial diffusivity, increased radial diffusivity, or both. This implied axonal damage and demyelination. We observed that the magnitude of the changes was not always uniform across substructures of the brainstem. Specifically, the changes in DTI parameters for TPF were more pronounced than in other regions (P<.001 for FA) despite similarities in the distribution of dose. We did not find a significant difference among CST, ML, and MCP in these patients (P>.093 for all parameters). CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the structural integrity of white matter tracts, assessed by DTI, were not uniform across the brainstem after radiation therapy. These results support a role for tract-based assessment in radiation treatment planning and determination of brainstem tolerance.

Title:Family functioning and the social adaptation of hearing-impaired youths.
Authors:['Watson SM', 'Henggeler SW', 'Whelan JP']

Abstract:This study examined the associations between important aspects of family functioning and the adjustment of hearing-impaired youths. Participants were 75 hearing-impaired youths and their hearing parents. The dependent variables were mothers' and fathers' ratings of child behavior problems and social competence. Independent variables included parental symptomatology, parental ratings of family stress, and family members' perceptions of family cohesion and family adaptability. Demographic characteristics and the youth's degree of hearing loss and mode of communication were used as control variables. Results from multiple regression analyses showed that parental ratings of the youths' behavior problems were linked with parental symptomatology, and that maternal ratings of the youths' behavior problems were associated with low family adaptability. Parental ratings of the youths' social competence were predicted by family stress. Overall, key aspects of family functioning accounted for considerably more variance than did the control variables. The methodological and conceptual implications of the findings are discussed.

Abstract:Impulsivity has been implicated as a contributing factor in the development of gambling problems among college students, but attempts to confirm this relation have been inconsistent. One explanation for these incongruent findings is that impulsivity may be multidimensional and that distinct dimensions differentially predict separate behaviors. Using a large, diverse sample of college students, a factor analysis of self-report measures related to impulsivity revealed a three-factor structure of Behavioral Activation, Preference for Stimulation, and Inhibition Control that was similar to the structure found by Meda et al. (Behav Pharmacol 20(5-6):390-399, 2009) in a different adult sample. Low risk gamblers and symptomatic gamblers scored significantly lower on Behavioral Activation and Inhibition Control than non-gamblers. Conversely, low risk gamblers and symptomatic gamblers scored significantly higher on Preference for Stimulation. Prevalence of gambling and gambling activity preference for this sample was also assessed.

Abstract:Mutations in VCP cause multisystem degeneration impacting the nervous system, muscle, and/or bone. Patients may present with ALS, Parkinsonism, frontotemporal dementia, myopathy, Paget's disease, or a combination of these. The disease mechanism is unknown. We developed a Drosophila model of VCP mutation-dependent degeneration. The phenotype is reminiscent of PINK1 and parkin mutants, including a pronounced mitochondrial defect. Indeed, VCP interacts genetically with the PINK1/parkin pathway in vivo. Paradoxically, VCP complements PINK1 deficiency but not parkin deficiency. The basis of this paradox is resolved by mechanistic studies in vitro showing that VCP recruitment to damaged mitochondria requires Parkin-mediated ubiquitination of mitochondrial targets. VCP recruitment coincides temporally with mitochondrial fission, and VCP is required for proteasome-dependent degradation of Mitofusins in vitro and in vivo. Further, VCP and its adaptor Npl4/Ufd1 are required for clearance of damaged mitochondria via the PINK1/Parkin pathway, and this is impaired by pathogenic mutations in VCP.

Title:Dynamic view on affordability of fixed-dose combination antihypertensive drug therapy.
Authors:['Hong SH', 'Wang J', 'Tang J']
Affiliation:College of Pharmacy, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. shhong@uthsc.edu
Abstract:BACKGROUND: The use of fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) has been increasing since the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommended using >/=2 drugs as the first-line drug therapy for patients with stage 2 hypertension. FDCs simplify the drug therapy regimen and reportedly lower the drug therapy cost compared with the free combination (FC) of 2 single-agent drugs. This study hypothesized that the affordability of FDCs over FCs would change over time depending on the availability of generic single-agent drugs. METHODS: This study used the 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Antihypertensive drugs were identified based on the Food and Drug Administration national drug directory. Based on the 2 databases, regression models were run to predict average monthly drug cost as well as out-of-pocket cost for each prescription along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Overall, FDCs (n = 26) had average monthly drug costs similar to respective FCs when FCs were not generically available. However, when FCs were generically available, FDCs (n = 11) had average drugs costs much higher than their respective FCs. For example, Lotrel as an FDC had an average monthly drug cost of $115.97 (95% CI = $96.59-$135.36), whereas its counterpart FC had an average monthly drug cost of $21.00 (95% CI = $18.23-$23.79). CONCLUSIONS: The cost advantage of FDCs over FCs was reversed when FCs were generically available. The finding of this study informs patients, health-care providers, and drug plans of the importance of making dynamic decisions on preferred drug therapy options depending on the availability of generic drugs.

Title:Characterization of a three-dimensional double-helix point-spread function for fluorescence microscopy in the presence of spherical aberration.
Authors:['Ghosh S', 'Preza C']
Affiliation:Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:We characterize the three-dimensional (3-D) double-helix (DH) point-spread function (PSF) for depth-variant fluorescence microscopy imaging motivated by our interest to integrate the DH-PSF in computational optical sectioning microscopy (COSM) imaging. Physical parameters, such as refractive index and thickness variability of imaging layers encountered in 3-D microscopy give rise to depth-induced spherical aberration (SA) that change the shape of the PSF at different focusing depths and render computational approaches less practical. Theoretical and experimental studies performed to characterize the DH-PSF under varying imaging conditions are presented. Results show reasonable agreement between theoretical and experimental DH-PSFs suggesting that our model can predict the main features of the data. The depth-variability of the DH-PSF due to SA, quantified using a normalized mean square error, shows that the DH-PSF is more robust to SA than the conventional PSF. This result is also supported by the frequency analysis of the DH-PSF shown. Our studies suggest that further investigation of the DH-PSF's use in COSM is warranted, and that particle localization accuracy using the DH-PSF calibration curve in the presence of SA can be improved by accounting for the axial shift due to SA.

Title:A daptomycin-xylitol-loaded polymethylmethacrylate bone cement: how much xylitol should be used?
Authors:['Salehi A', 'Parker AC', 'Lewis G', 'Courtney HS', 'Haggard WO']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, 316 Engineering Science Building, Memphis, TN, 38152, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: The rate of release of an antibiotic from an antibiotic-loaded polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement is low. This may be increased by adding a particulate poragen (eg, xylitol) to the cement powder. However, the appropriate poragen amount is unclear. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We explored the appropriate amount of xylitol to use in a PMMA bone cement loaded with daptomycin and xylitol. METHODS: We prepared four groups of cement, each comprising the same amount of daptomycin in the powder (1.36 g/40 g dry powder) but different amounts of xylitol (0, 0.7, 1.4, and 2.7 g); the xylitol mass ratio (X) (mass divided by mass of the final dry cement-daptomycin-xylitol mixture) ranged from 0 to 6.13 wt/wt%. Eight mechanical, antibiotic release, and bacterial inhibitory properties were determined using three to 22 specimens or replicates per test. We then used an optimization method to determine an appropriate value of X by (1) identifying the best-fit relationship between the value of each property and X, (2) defining a master objective function incorporating all of the best fits; and (3) determining the value of X at the maximum master objective function. RESULTS: We found an appropriate xylitol amount to be 4.46 wt/wt% (equivalent to 1.93 g xylitol mixed with 1.36 g daptomycin and 40 g dry cement powder). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a method that may be used to determine an appropriate xylitol amount for a daptomycin-xylitol-loaded PMMA bone cement. These findings will require in vivo confirmation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: While we identified an appropriate amount of xylitol in a daptomycin-xylitol-loaded PMMA bone cement as a prophylactic agent in total joint arthroplasties, clinical evaluations are needed to confirm the effectiveness of this cement.

Title:Predictions of phase separation in three-component lipid membranes by the MARTINI force field.

Affiliation:Department of Physics, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:The phase behavior of the coarse-grained MARTINI model for three-component lipid bilayers composed of dipalmytoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), cholesterol (Chol), and an unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) was systematically investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The aim of this study is to understand which types of unsaturated PC induce the formation of thermodynamically stable coexisting phases when added to mixtures of DPPC and Chol and to unravel the mechanisms that drive phase separation in such three-component mixtures. Our simulations indicate that the currently used MARTINI force field does not induce such phase separation in mixtures of DPPC, Chol, and unsaturated PCs with a low unsaturation level, such as palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) or dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC). Also, we found that phase separation does occur in mixtures of DPPC, Chol, and polyunsaturated PCs, such as dilinoleyl-phosphatidylcholine (DUPC) and diarachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DAPC). Through systematic tweaking of the interactions between the hydrophobic groups of the PC molecules, we show that the appearance of phase separation in three-component lipid bilayers, as modeled through the MARTINI force field, is primarily due to the interactions between the coarse-grained molecules, i.e., the beads, rather than due to the differences between the conformations of saturated and unsaturated lipid acyl chains, namely entropy driven.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of gene expression profiles in subcutaneous adipose tissue with weight change in kidney transplant recipients and to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of weight gain. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A secondary data analysis was done on a subgroup (n = 26) of existing clinical and gene expression data from a larger prospective longitudinal study examining factors contributing to weight gain in transplant recipients. Measurements taken included adipose tissue gene expression profiles at time of transplant, baseline and six-month weight, and demographic data. Using multivariate linear regression analysis controlled for race and gender, expression levels of 1553 genes were significantly (p<0.05) associated with weight change. Functional analysis using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes classifications identified metabolic pathways that were enriched in this dataset. Furthermore, GeneIndexer literature mining analysis identified a subset of genes that are highly associated with obesity in the literature and Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed several significant gene networks associated with metabolism and endocrine function. Polymorphisms in several of these genes have previously been linked to obesity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have successfully identified a set of molecular pathways that taken together may provide insights into the mechanisms of weight gain in kidney transplant recipients.

Abstract:The mechanism of sex determination in channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus was evaluated by hormonal and genetic methods. Aromatizable and nonaromatizable androgens, as well as an estrogen, caused feminization in fish fed steroids for 21 days after yolk-sac absorption. The effectiveness of 60 micrograms of ethynyltestosterone/g food decreased markedly when the experimental feeding period was shortened and was ineffective when the treatment lasted less than 12 days. Females from all-female populations produced by treatment with sex hormones were mated with normal males resulting in nine spawns with a sex ratio different from 1:1. The sex ratios were statistically similar to 3 male: 1 female in five spawns, both 2:1 and 3:1 in two spawns, and 2:1 in two spawns. These data are consistent with a model for female homogametic sex determination in channel catfish and suggest that the YY equivalent genotype is viable.

Abstract:A series of 4-aryl-2-benzoyl-imidazoles were designed and synthesized based on our previously reported 2-aryl-4-benzoyl-imidazole (ABI) derivatives. The new structures reversed the aryl group and the benzoyl group of previous ABI structures and were named as reverse ABI (RABI) analogues. RABIs were evaluated for biological activity against eight cancer cell lines including multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines. In vitro assays indicated that several RABI compounds had excellent antiproliferative properties, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. The average IC50 of the most active compound 12a is 14 nM. In addition, the mechanism of action of these new analogues was investigated by cell cycle analysis, tubulin polymerization assay, competitive mass spectrometry binding assay, and molecular docking studies. These studies confirmed that these new RABI analogues maintain their mechanisms of action by disrupting tubulin polymerization, similar to their parental ABI analogues.

Title:Hierarchical random cellular neural networks for system-level brain-like signal processing.
Authors:['Kozma R', 'Puljic M']
Affiliation:Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. rkozma@memphis.edu
Abstract:Sensory information processing and cognition in brains are modeled using dynamic systems theory. The brain's dynamic state is described by a trajectory evolving in a high-dimensional state space. We introduce a hierarchy of random cellular automata as the mathematical tools to describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of the cortex. The corresponding brain model is called neuropercolation which has distinct advantages compared to traditional models using differential equations, especially in describing spatio-temporal discontinuities in the form of phase transitions. Phase transitions demarcate singularities in brain operations at critical conditions, which are viewed as hallmarks of higher cognition and awareness experience. The introduced Monte-Carlo simulations obtained by parallel computing point to the importance of computer implementations using very large-scale integration (VLSI) and analog platforms.

Title:Functional flexibility of infant vocalization and the emergence of language.

Abstract:We report on the emergence of functional flexibility in vocalizations of human infants. This vastly underappreciated capability becomes apparent when prelinguistic vocalizations express a full range of emotional content--positive, neutral, and negative. The data show that at least three types of infant vocalizations (squeals, vowel-like sounds, and growls) occur with this full range of expression by 3-4 mo of age. In contrast, infant cry and laughter, which are species-specific signals apparently homologous to vocal calls in other primates, show functional stability, with cry overwhelmingly expressing negative and laughter positive emotional states. Functional flexibility is a sine qua non in spoken language, because all words or sentences can be produced as expressions of varying emotional states and because learning conventional "meanings" requires the ability to produce sounds that are free of any predetermined function. Functional flexibility is a defining characteristic of language, and empirically it appears before syntax, word learning, and even earlier-developing features presumed to be critical to language (e.g., joint attention, syllable imitation, and canonical babbling). The appearance of functional flexibility early in the first year of human life is a critical step in the development of vocal language and may have been a critical step in the evolution of human language, preceding protosyntax and even primitive single words. Such flexible affect expression of vocalizations has not yet been reported for any nonhuman primate but if found to occur would suggest deep roots for functional flexibility of vocalization in our primate heritage.

Title:Effects of VEGF-loaded chitosan coatings.
Authors:['Leedy MR', 'Jennings JA', 'Haggard WO', 'Bumgardner JD']

Abstract:Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a powerful growth factor that promotes vascularization as well as osteoblastic differentiation and bone regeneration, all of which are key processes in the osseointegration of dental implants. Strategies to increase vascularization through delivery of VEGF may improve osseointegration, especially in patients with reduced bone healing potential. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of chitosan coatings on titanium to deliver VEGF and to support growth and matrix production of osteoblastic cells in vitro. Chitosan was chemically bonded to titanium coupons via silane-glutaraldehyde linker molecules and loaded with 0, 20, 50, or 100 ng of VEGF. Protein was released during a three day period with around 75% of VEGF (4.44, 11.37, and 22.10 ng/mL/cm(2) from the 20, 50, and 100 ng loaded levels, respectively) released during the first 12 h, and 90-95% of the VEGF released from the coatings by day 3. Saos-2 bone cells continued to proliferate over the 28-day period on the VEGF-loaded chitosan coatings in contrast to cells seeded on uncoated titanium, which plateaued after 14 days. Cells on uncoated titanium exhibited a peak in alkaline phosphatase expression at approximately 14 days, concomitant with the plateau in growth. While osteoblast-like cells on all chitosan coatings exhibited up to a 2-fold enhancement of the alkaline phosphatase activity and 10-fold increase in calcium deposition compared to uncoated controls, the incorporation of VEGF into the coatings did not enhance osteoblast matrix production over plain chitosan coatings throughout this study.

Abstract:The emphasis on eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare has received national attention, with various policy initiatives addressing this problem and proposing solutions. However, in the current economic era requiring tight monetary constraints, emphasis is increasingly being placed on economic efficiency, which often conflicts with the equality doctrine upon which many policies have been framed. The authors' review aims to highlight the disparity implications of one such policy provision - the predominantly utilization-based eligibility criteria for medication therapy management services under Medicare Part D - by identifying studies that have documented racial and ethnic disparities in health status and the use of and spending on prescription medications. Future design and evaluation of various regulations and legislations employing utilization-based eligibility criteria must use caution in order to strike an equity-efficiency balance.

Abstract:The most common pediatric brain tumors are low-grade gliomas (LGGs). We used whole-genome sequencing to identify multiple new genetic alterations involving BRAF, RAF1, FGFR1, MYB, MYBL1 and genes with histone-related functions, including H3F3A and ATRX, in 39 LGGs and low-grade glioneuronal tumors (LGGNTs). Only a single non-silent somatic alteration was detected in 24 of 39 (62%) tumors. Intragenic duplications of the portion of FGFR1 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and rearrangements of MYB were recurrent and mutually exclusive in 53% of grade II diffuse LGGs. Transplantation of Trp53-null neonatal astrocytes expressing FGFR1 with the duplication involving the TKD into the brains of nude mice generated high-grade astrocytomas with short latency and 100% penetrance. FGFR1 with the duplication induced FGFR1 autophosphorylation and upregulation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K pathways, which could be blocked by specific inhibitors. Focusing on the therapeutically challenging diffuse LGGs, our study of 151 tumors has discovered genetic alterations and potential therapeutic targets across the entire range of pediatric LGGs and LGGNTs.

Title:Development of the Profile of Hearing Aid Performance (PHAP).
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Gilmore C']
Affiliation:Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, Memphis State University, TN.
Abstract:This paper reports the development of the Profile of Hearing Aid Performance (PHAP), a 66-item self-administered inventory that quantifies performance with a hearing aid in everyday life using both seven-score and four-score profiles. The profiles assess experience with amplification in terms of speech communication in three types of listening situations and in terms of reactions to amplified environmental sounds. The PHAP has been evaluated using groups consisting mainly of elderly hearing aid wearers having mild to moderate hearing impairments. Internal consistency reliability of the scales and subscales ranges from .70 to .91. Test-retest correlations range from .66 to .88. Ninety percent and 95% critical differences are presented to facilitate evaluation of differences between scores for the same individual under different conditions. It is envisioned that the PHAP will have its principal application in research evaluating and comparing different approaches to hearing aid fittings. In addition, the inventory can be used clinically to assess existing hearing aid fittings.

Abstract:Concurrent associations between attachment style and social support in posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and generalized anxiety disorder were explored using regression analyses in a sample of 108 victims of intimate partner violence. To examine whether assessment modality influenced findings, self-report and clinician ratings of psychopathology were compared. Both lower perceived social support and higher attachment anxiety were significantly associated with higher self-reported PTSD; however, only lower social support was significantly associated with clinician assessed PTSD. Lower social support, higher attachment anxiety, and lower attachment closeness were related with higher self-reported depression; however, only lower social support was related to clinician assessed depression. Lastly, only higher attachment anxiety was associated with self-reported GAD, whereas lower attachment dependency showed the only significant association in clinician assessed GAD. Possible explanations for discrepancies between assessment modalities are discussed, with emphasis on application to intimate partner violence and suggestions for future research.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Although bacterial antibiotic resistance is increasing, fewer new antibiotics are being developed to compensate. Localized delivery of synergistic antiseptics and antibiotics with a chitosan sponge device may offer an alternative infection treatment. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In this pilot study, we asked whether antiseptic and antibiotic combinations provided in vitro synergism against Staphylococcus aureus, whether synergism reduces cell viability, and whether their combination releases drugs at inhibitory levels. METHODS: To investigate the pharmacodynamics among three combinations of the antiseptic chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) with the antibiotics amikacin, daptomycin, and vancomycin (VAN) (n=1), we determined the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index against S aureus Cowan I. The determined synergistic combination of CHX and VAN was evaluated for cell compatibility using NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (n=3) and the drug release profile from a chitosan sponge device (n=5). RESULTS: With an FIC index<0.5, the combination of CHX+VAN exhibited synergism against S aureus. CHX concentrations>/=3.91 mug/mL resulted in fibroblast viability decrease, whereas the combination of CHX+VAN did not decrease fibroblast viability until their concentrations reached >/=7.81 mug/mL. The CHX and VAN release profile, both individually and in combination, was an initial bolus with no difference between eluate concentrations after Day 5. CONCLUSIONS: CHX+VAN combination may be delivered locally by a chitosan sponge that synergistically inhibits S aureus growth. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of synergism between combined antibiotic and antiseptics delivered at high local concentrations with an implanted chitosan sponge may provide a useful alternative infection treatment option.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: We wished to investigate the prevalence of missing lymph nodes (MLN), factors contributing to MLN, and the effect of MLN on progression free survival (PFS). METHODS: Patients with uterine cancer undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy were recruited. All surgeries adhered to the Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol in collecting all the lymph node tissues in paraaortic, common iliac, obturator fossa, and external and internal iliac bilaterally. Data regarding race, age, body mass index (BMI), lymph node counts, staging, location of missing lymph nodes, length of surgery, and estimated blood loss were collected and analyzed in reference to missing lymph nodes. The definition of missing lymph node was an incomplete nodal specimen obtained without actual lymph node tissue. RESULTS: Between April 2003 and January 2010, 235 consecutive patients were enrolled prospectively; 108 patients had missing lymph nodes post-operatively (46%), and 127 patients had complete lymph nodes. We found no correlation between MLN relative to race (P = 0.97), age (P = 0.25), BMI (P = 0.09), estimated blood loss (P = 0.38), American Society of Anaesthesiologist physical status classification system (P = 0.18), surgery time (P = 0.22), hospital stay (P = 0.05), nodes without cancer (P =0.12), nodes with cancer (P = 0.99), stage (P = 0.90), grade (P = 0.17), or PFS (P = 0.29). CONCLUSION: In our study, although prevalence of missing lymph nodes seems relatively high, none of the perioperative variables studied appeared to contribute to missing lymph nodes. Finally, missing lymph nodes did not affect progression free survival.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of community pharmacy-based interventions in increasing vaccination rates for the herpes zoster vaccine. DESIGN: Prospective intervention study with a pre-post design. SETTING: Three independent community pharmacies in Tennessee, from December 2007 to June 2008. PATIENTS: Patients whose pharmacy profiles indicated that they were eligible for the vaccine and patients presenting to receive the vaccine at study sites. INTERVENTION: Pharmacists promoted the herpes zoster vaccine through a press release published in local newspapers, a flyer accompanying each prescription dispensed at participating pharmacies, and a personalized letter mailed to patients whose pharmacy profiles indicated that they were eligible for the vaccine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of vaccination rates for the herpes zoster vaccine during the control and intervention periods and patients' indication for their sources of education and influence in receiving the vaccine. RESULTS: Vaccination rates increased from 0.37% (n = 59 of 16,121) during the control period to 1.20% (n = 193 of 16,062) during the intervention period ( P < 0.0001). Cochran-Armitage trend analyses, including the months before and after the interventions, confirmed a significantly higher vaccination rate during the intervention month than other months analyzed. More patients indicated that they were educated about the herpes zoster vaccine by one of the pharmacist-driven interventions than by a physician, family/friend, or other source during the intervention period ( P < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Also, more patients were influenced to receive the vaccination as a result of one of the pharmacist-driven interventions than influenced by a physician ( P = 0.0260) or other source ( P < 0.0001). No difference in the effectiveness of patient influence was found when the pharmacy interventions were compared with family/friends ( P = 0.1025). CONCLUSION: Three pharmacist-driven interventions were effective in increasing vaccination rates for the herpes zoster vaccine.

Title:The genetic basis of speciation in the Giliopsis lineage of Ipomopsis (Polemoniaceae).
Authors:['Nakazato T', 'Rieseberg LH', 'Wood TE']
Affiliation:Department of Biological Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:One of the most powerful drivers of speciation in plants is pollinator-mediated disruptive selection, which leads to the divergence of floral traits adapted to the morphology and behavior of different pollinators. Despite the widespread importance of this speciation mechanism, its genetic basis has been explored in only a few groups. Here, we characterize the genetic basis of pollinator-mediated divergence of two species in genus Ipomopsis, I. guttata and I. tenuifolia, using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses of floral traits and other variable phenotypes. We detected one to six QTLs per trait, with each QTL generally explaining small to modest amounts of the phenotypic variance of a backcross hybrid population. In contrast, flowering time and anthocyanin abundance (a metric of color variation) were controlled by a few QTLs of relatively large effect. QTLs were strongly clustered within linkage groups, with 26 of 37 QTLs localized to six marker-interval 'hotspots,' all of which harbored pleiotropic QTLs. In contrast to other studies that have examined the genetic basis of pollinator shifts, our results indicate that, in general, mutations of small to modest effect on phenotype were involved. Thus, the evolutionary transition between the distinct pollination modes of I. guttata and I. tenuifolia likely proceeded incrementally, rather than saltationally.

Abstract:Vitamin C (VC) is well known as an antioxidant in humans, primates and guinea pigs. Studies have suggested gender differences in VC requirements in humans, and gender differences in oxidant injury vulnerability in early life may represent a biological mechanism contributing to gender disparity in later life. Using spontaneous bone fracture (sfx) mice, which lack the gene for L-Gulonolactone oxidase (Gulo), we studied the potential sex difference in expression profiles of oxidative genes at the whole-genome level. Then, we analyzed data of gene expressions in a mouse population of recombinant inbred (RI) strains originally derived by crossing C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) mice. Our data indicated that there were sex differences in the regulation of pre- and pro-oxidative genes in sfx mice. The associations of expression levels among Gulo, its partner genes and oxidative genes in the BXD (B6 x D2) RI strains showed a sex difference. Transcriptome mapping suggests that Gulo was regulated differently between female and male mice in BXD RI strains. Our study indicates the importance of investigating sex differences in Gulo and its oxidative function by using available mouse models.

Abstract:Controlled exposure experiments can be very informative, however, they are based on the assumption that pathogens maintained on artificial media under long-term storage retain the infective and pathogenic properties of the reproducing pathogen as it occurs in a host. We observed that JEL284, an in vitro cultured and maintained isolate of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), was becoming less infectious with successive uses. We hypothesized that passing an isolate propagated on artificial media through an amphibian host would make the isolate more infectious and pathogenic in subsequent exposures. To test our hypothesis, we used two discreet steps, a reisolation step (step 1) and a comparative exposure step (step 2). In step 1, we exposed eastern spadefoot toads, Scaphiopus holbrooki, to JEL284 and JEL197, another isolate that had been maintained in vitro for over six years. We then re-isolated JEL284 only from a successful infection and named this new isolate JEL284(FMBa). JEL197 did not infect any amphibians and, thus, did not proceed to step 2. In step 2, we compared infectivity and pathogenicity (mortality and survival time) of JEL284 and JEL284(FMBa) by exposing 54 naive S. holbrooki to three treatments (JEL284, JEL284(FMBa), and negative control) with 18 individuals per group. We found that JEL284(FMBa) caused higher mortality and decreased survival time in infected individuals when compared to JEL284 and negative controls. Thus, our data show that pathogenicity of Bd can decrease when cultured successively in media only and can be partially restored by passage through an amphibian host. Therefore, we have demonstrated that pathogenicity shifts can occur rapidly in this pathogen. Given the potential for shifts in pathogenicity demonstrated here, we suspect Bd to have similar potential in natural populations. We suggest that, when possible, the use of freshly isolated or cryopreserved Bd would improve the quality of controlled exposure experiments using this pathogen.

Abstract:INTRODUCTION: The effects of anesthesia are infrequently considered when interpreting pediatric perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The objectives of this study were to test for measurable differences in MR measures of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) between non-sedated and propofol-sedated children, and to identify influential factors. METHODS: Supratentorial cortical CBF and CBV measured by dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion MRI in 37 children (1.8-18 years) treated for infratentorial brain tumors receiving propofol (IV, n = 19) or no sedation (NS, n = 18) were compared between groups and correlated with age, hematocrit (Hct), end-tidal CO(2) (ETCO(2)), dose, weight, and history of radiation therapy (RT). The model most predictive of CBF and CBV was identified by multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory CBF were significantly lower, and MCA territory CBV greater (p = 0.03), in IV than NS patients (p = 0.01, 0.04). The usual trend of decreasing CBF with age was reversed with propofol in ACA and MCA territories (r = 0.53, r = 0.47; p < 0.05). ACA and MCA CBF (r = 0.59, 0.49; p < 0.05) and CBV in ACA, MCA, and posterior cerebral artery territories (r = 0.73, 0.80, 0.52; p < 0.05) increased with weight in propofol-sedated children, with no significant additional influence from age, ETCO(2), hematocrit, or RT. CONCLUSION: In propofol-sedated children, usual age-related decreases in CBF were reversed, and increases in CBF and CBV were weight-dependent, not previously described. Weight-dependent increases in propofol clearance may diminish suppression of CBF and CBV. Prospective study is required to establish anesthetic-specific models of CBF and CBV in children.

Abstract:RATIONALE: In gestational exposure studies, a fostered group is frequently used to control for drug-induced maternal effects. However, fostering itself has varying effects depending on the parameters under investigation OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess whether maternal behavior contributed to enhanced acquisition (higher number of bar presses compared to controls) of nicotine self-administration (SA) displayed by offspring with gestational nicotine and ethanol (Nic+EtOH) exposure. METHODS: Offspring were exposed to Nic+EtOH throughout full gestation, that is, gestational days (GD) GD2-20 and during postnatal days 2-12 (PN2-12), the rodent third trimester equivalent of human gestation during which rapid brain growth and synaptogenesis occur. Young adult (PN60) male offspring acquired operant nicotine SA, using a model of unlimited (i.e., 23 h) access to nicotine. RESULTS: Gestational drug treatments did not alter litter parameters (body weight, volume distribution, crown-rump length, and brain weight) or postnatal growth of the offspring. Fostering increased locomotor activity to a novel environment on PN45 regardless of gestational treatment group. Surprisingly, fostering per se significantly increased the SA behavior of drug-naive pair-fed controls, so that their drug-taking behavior resembled the enhanced nicotine SA observed in non-fostered offspring exposed to Nic+EtOH during gestation. In contrast, fostering did not change the SA behavior of the Nic+EtOH group. CONCLUSIONS: Fostering is shown to be its own experimental variable, ultimately increasing the acquisition of nicotine SA in control, drug-naive offspring. As such, the current dogma that fostering is required for our gestationally drug-exposed offspring is contraindicated.

Abstract:The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential benefit of 3D composite scaffolds composed of chitosan and calcium phosphate for bone tissue engineering. Additionally, incorporation of mechanically weak lyophilized microspheres within those air-dried (AD) was considered for enhanced bioactivity. AD microsphere, alone, and air- and freeze-dried microsphere (FDAD) 3D scaffolds were evaluated in vitro using a 28-day osteogenic culture model with the Saos-2 cell line. Mechanical testing, quantitative microscopy, and lysozyme-driven enzymatic degradation of the scaffolds were also studied. FDAD scaffold showed a higher concentration (p < 0.01) in cells per scaffold mass vs. AD constructs. Collagen was approximately 31% greater (p < 0.01) on FDAD compared to AD scaffolds not evident in microscopy of microsphere surfaces. Alternatively, AD scaffolds demonstrated a superior threefold increase in compressive strength over FDAD (12 vs. 4 MPa) with minimal degradation. Inclusion of FD spheres within the FDAD scaffolds allowed increased cellular activity through improved seeding, proliferation, and extracellular matrix production (as collagen), although mechanical strength was sacrificed through introduction of the less stiff, porous FD spheres.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Since 2009, pharmacists in all 50 states in the U.S. have been authorized to administer vaccinations. OBJECTIVES: This study examined racial and ethnic disparities in the reported receipt of influenza vaccinations within the past year among noninstitutionalized community pharmacy patients and non-community pharmacy respondents. METHODS: The 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey was analyzed. The sample consisted of respondents aged 50 years or older, as per the 2009 recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the influenza vaccination rates and disparities in receiving influenza vaccinations within past year between non-Hispanic Whites (Whites), non-Hispanic Blacks (Blacks) and Hispanics. The influenza vaccination rates between community pharmacy patients and non-community pharmacy respondents were also examined. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses found that among the community pharmacy patients, a greater proportion of Whites reported receiving influenza vaccinations compared to Blacks (60.9% vs. 49.1%; P < 0.0001) and Hispanics (60.9% vs. 51.7%; P < 0.0001). Among non-community pharmacy respondents, differences also were observed in reported influenza vaccination rates among Whites compared to Blacks (41.0% vs. 24.3%; P < 0.0001) and Hispanics (41.0% vs. 26.0%; P < 0.0001). Adjusted logistic regression analyses found significant racial disparities between Blacks and Whites in receiving influenza vaccinations within the past year among both community pharmacy patients (odds ratio [OR]: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.69-0.95) and non-community pharmacy respondents (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46-0.94). Sociodemographic characteristics and health status accounted for the disparities between Hispanics and Whites. Overall, community pharmacy patients reported higher influenza vaccination rates compared to non-community pharmacy respondents (59.0% vs. 37.2%; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Although influenza vaccination rates were higher among community pharmacy patients, there were racial disparities in receiving influenza vaccinations among both community pharmacy patients and non-community pharmacy respondents. Increased emphasis on educational campaigns among pharmacists and their patients, especially minorities, may be needed.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES: Alcohol use in the U.S. military is prevalent and associated with alcohol-related incidents (ARIs), an official U.S. Air Force sanction. Military ARIs incur substantial personal and financial costs. We evaluated the impact of the Alcohol Misconduct Prevention Program (AMPP) consisting of a group-based brief alcohol intervention (BAI) conducted jointly with random alcohol breathalyzer testing on ARIs in the U.S. Air Force. METHODS: A 1-hour, group-based, interactive BAI was conducted, and random alcohol breathalyzer testing was performed among 10,087 Air Force Technical Trainees at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, in fiscal years 2010 and 2011. RESULTS: The AMPP was associated with a significant reduction in the odds of an ARI over the year of the intervention compared to the previous year (odds ratio 0.555; 95% confidence interval 0.380-0.811; p = 0.0023). Significant reductions in the number of ARIs were observed within all quarters except for the third. The average rate of ARIs per 1,000 trainees per quarter was 7.30 before implementation of the interventions and 4.06 after implementation. CONCLUSION: An AMPP consisting of an interactive BAI and random alcohol breathalyzer testing may decrease ARIs among military trainees.

Title:Is autism a disease of the cerebellum? An integration of clinical and pre-clinical research.

Affiliation:Department of Psychology, The University of Memphis Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:Autism spectrum disorders are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social skills and communication, stereotyped and repetitive behavior, and a range of deficits in cognitive function. While the etiology of autism is unknown, current research indicates that abnormalities of the cerebellum, now believed to be involved in cognitive function and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), are associated with autism. The current paper proposes that impaired cerebello-cortical circuitry could, at least in part, underlie autistic symptoms. The use of animal models that allow for manipulation of genetic and environmental influences are an effective means of elucidating both distal and proximal etiological factors in autism and their potential impact on cerebello-cortical circuitry. Some existing rodent models of autism, as well as some models not previously applied to the study of the disorder, display cerebellar and behavioral abnormalities that parallel those commonly seen in autistic patients. The novel findings produced from research utilizing rodent models could provide a better understanding of the neurochemical and behavioral impact of changes in cerebello-cortical circuitry in autism.

Abstract:Despite the growing body of research on faith-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) initiatives, there are few studies exploring the perspective of faith leaders involved in HIV prevention efforts. This exploratory study examined how 29 faith leaders conceptualized key aspects of HIV prevention. Sexual health beliefs, perspectives on condom distribution, and facilitating factors and barriers to implementing an HIV program were explored. Seventy-six percent of participants agreed with the statement "they would be willing to make condoms available to adolescents." These findings highlight the importance of reconciling any differences between religious doctrine, leadership role, and beliefs of faith leaders in addressing HIV in churches.

Title:Mechanobiology in lung epithelial cells: measurements, perturbations, and responses.
Authors:['Waters CM', 'Roan E', 'Navajas D']
Affiliation:University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. cwaters2@uthsc.edu
Abstract:Epithelial cells of the lung are located at the interface between the environment and the organism and serve many important functions including barrier protection, fluid balance, clearance of particulate, initiation of immune responses, mucus and surfactant production, and repair following injury. Because of the complex structure of the lung and its cyclic deformation during the respiratory cycle, epithelial cells are exposed to continuously varying levels of mechanical stresses. While normal lung function is maintained under these conditions, changes in mechanical stresses can have profound effects on the function of epithelial cells and therefore the function of the organ. In this review, we will describe the types of stresses and strains in the lungs, how these are transmitted, and how these may vary in human disease or animal models. Many approaches have been developed to better understand how cells sense and respond to mechanical stresses, and we will discuss these approaches and how they have been used to study lung epithelial cells in culture. Understanding how cells sense and respond to changes in mechanical stresses will contribute to our understanding of the role of lung epithelial cells during normal function and development and how their function may change in diseases such as acute lung injury, asthma, emphysema, and fibrosis.

Title:Exogenous T(3) elicits long day-like alterations in testis size and the RFamides Kisspeptin and gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone in short-day Siberian hamsters.
Authors:['Henson JR', 'Carter SN', 'Freeman DA']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, 313 Life Sciences Building, Memphis, TN 38152, USA. jrhenson@memphis.edu
Abstract:Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exhibit robust seasonal rhythms of reproduction driven by changes in day length. Day length is encoded endogenously by the duration of nocturnal melatonin (Mel) secretion from the pineal gland. Short duration Mel signals stimulate whereas long duration Mel signals inhibit reproduction. The mechanism by which Mel regulates the reproductive axis has not been fully characterized. In Siberian hamsters, the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T(3)) is thought to be part of the photoperiodic mechanism. The availability of T(3) is decreased in hamsters housed in short day lengths, and injections of exogenous T(3) stimulate testicular growth in short-day (SD) Siberian hamsters. Thus, T(3) acts as a neuroendocrine intermediate between the Mel rhythm and the reproductive axis. The RFamides kisspeptin (Kiss1) and gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH) also act as a link between the Mel rhythm and the reproductive axis. Expression of both of these neuropeptides is regulated by photoperiod and Mel. Kiss1 stimulates, and GnIH inhibits, the reproductive axis in long-day housed hamsters. It remains unknown whether T(3) acts through changes in RFamide expression in the regulation of reproduction or whether these molecules act independently of one another. We tested the hypothesis that exogenous T(3) administered to SD hamsters, a treatment that stimulates testicular growth, would also result in alterations in the patterns of Kiss1- and GnIH-immunoreactivity. Administration of T(3) to SD hamsters resulted in significant testicular growth as well as a long day-like pattern of RFamide peptide expression. Thus, exogenous T(3) elicited increased numbers of Kiss1-positive cells in the hypothalamic anteroventral periventricular nucleus, decreased numbers of Kiss1-positive cells in the arcuate nucleus, and a greater number of GnIH-positive cells in the dorsomedial hypothalamus compared with SD controls. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that T(3) elicits alterations in the reproductive axis through alterations in RFamide peptide expression.

Title:Nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 mediates p21-activated kinase 1 activation in the modulation of chemokine-induced human aortic smooth muscle cell F-actin stress fiber formation, migration, and proliferation and injury-induced vascular wall remodeling.

Abstract:Recent literature suggests that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) mediate cell migration. However, the mechanisms were not known. Therefore, the objective of this study is to test whether cyclin/CDKs activate Pak1, an effector of Rac1, whose involvement in the modulation of cell migration and proliferation is well established. Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1) induced Pak1 phosphorylation/activation in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in a delayed time-dependent manner. MCP1 also stimulated F-actin stress fiber formation in a delayed manner in HASMCs, as well as the migration and proliferation of these cells. Inhibition of Pak1 suppressed MCP1-induced HASMC F-actin stress fiber formation, migration, and proliferation. MCP1 induced cyclin D1 expression as well as CDK6 and CDK4 activities, and these effects were dependent on activation of NFATc1. Depletion of NFATc1, cyclin D1, CDK6, or CDK4 levels attenuated MCP1-induced Pak1 phosphorylation/activation and resulted in decreased HASMC F-actin stress fiber formation, migration, and proliferation. CDK4, which appeared to be activated downstream of CDK6, formed a complex with Pak1 in response to MCP1. MCP1 also activated Rac1 in a time-dependent manner, and depletion/inhibition of its levels/activation abrogated MCP1-induced NFATc1-cyclin D1-CDK6-CDK4-Pak1 signaling and, thereby, decreased HASMC F-actin stress fiber formation, migration, and proliferation. In addition, smooth muscle-specific deletion of NFATc1 led to decreased cyclin D1 expression and CDK6, CDK4, and Pak1 activities, resulting in reduced neointima formation in response to injury. Thus, these observations reveal that Pak1 is a downstream effector of CDK4 and Rac1-dependent, NFATc1-mediated cyclin D1 expression and CDK6 activity mediate this effect. In addition, smooth muscle-specific deletion of NFATc1 prevented the capacity of vascular smooth muscle cells for MCP-1-induced activation of the cyclin D1-CDK6-CDK4-Pak1 signaling axis, affecting their migration and proliferation in vitro and injury-induced neointima formation in vivo.

Abstract:Sparse distributed memory is an auto-associative memory system that stores high dimensional Boolean vectors. Here we present an extension of the original SDM, the Integer SDM that uses modular arithmetic integer vectors rather than binary vectors. This extension preserves many of the desirable properties of the original SDM: auto-associativity, content addressability, distributed storage, and robustness over noisy inputs. In addition, it improves the representation capabilities of the memory and is more robust over normalization. It can also be extended to support forgetting and reliable sequence storage. We performed several simulations that test the noise robustness property and capacity of the memory. Theoretical analyses of the memory's fidelity and capacity are also presented.

Abstract:Dendritic cells (DCs) play a crucial role in launching protective adaptive immunity against pathogens while maintaining immune tolerance to self-Ags. However, how intracellular signaling pathways program DCs to mediate tolerogenic responses remains largely unexplored. In this study, we describe that p38alpha signaling in CD103(+) mesenteric lymph node DCs reciprocally regulates the differentiation of anti-inflammatory induced regulatory T cells and proinflammatory Th1 cells from naive precursors and promotes mucosal tolerance. Deficiency of p38alpha in CD103(+) DCs inhibited the generation of induced regulatory T cells while promoting Th1 cell development in a TGF-beta2-dependent manner. Consequently, loss of p38alpha in DCs prevented induction of oral tolerance in vivo. Moreover, p38alpha in CD103(+) DCs was required for optimal expression of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, a key enzyme for retinoic acid synthesis, which in turn imprinted gut-homing receptors on responding T cells. Consistent with a crucial role of p38alpha to program the tolerogenic activity of CD103(+) DCs, such DC subset contained constitutive activity of p38alpha and abundant expression of TGF-beta2 and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase. Our studies identify a key mechanism of DC-mediated coupling of T cell differentiation and trafficking that orchestrates mucosal immune tolerance.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Previous studies have found that racial and ethnic minorities would be less likely to meet the Medicare eligibility criteria for medication therapy management (MTM) services than their non-Hispanic White counterparts. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether racial and ethnic disparities in health status, health services utilization and costs, and medication utilization patterns among MTM-ineligible individuals differed from MTM-eligible individuals. METHODS: This study analyzed Medicare beneficiaries in 2004-2005 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Various multivariate regressions were employed depending on the nature of dependent variables. Interaction terms between the dummy variables for Blacks (and Hispanics) and MTM eligibility were included to test whether disparity patterns varied between MTM-ineligible and MTM-eligible individuals. Main and sensitivity analyses were conducted for MTM eligibility thresholds for 2006 and 2010. RESULTS: Based on the main analysis for 2006 MTM eligibility criteria, the proportions for self-reported good health status for Whites and Blacks were 82.82% vs. 70.75%, respectively (difference = 12.07%; P < 0.001), among MTM-ineligible population; and 56.98% vs. 52.14%, respectively (difference = 4.84%; P = 0.31), among MTM-eligible population. The difference between these differences was 7.23% (P < 0.001). In the adjusted logistic regression, the interaction effect for Blacks and MTM eligibility had an OR of 1.57 (95% Confidence Interval, or CI = 0.98-2.52) on multiplicative term and difference in odds of 2.38 (95% CI = 1.54-3.22) on additive term. Analyses for disparities between Whites and Hispanics found similar disparity patterns. All analyses for 2006 and 2010 eligibility criteria generally reported similar patterns. Analyses of other measures did not find greater racial or ethnic disparities among the MTM-ineligible than MTM-eligible individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in MTM eligibility may aggravate existing racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes. However, disparities in MTM eligibility may not aggravate existing disparities in health services utilization and costs and medication utilization patterns. Future studies should examine the effects of Medicare Part D on these disparities.

Abstract:The purpose of this study is to enhance the dissolution rate of prednisone by co-grinding with Neusilin to form a complex that can be incorporated into a mini-tablet formulation for pediatrics. Prednisone-Neusilin complex was co-grinded at various ratios (1:1, 1:3, 1:5, and 1:7). The physicochemical properties of the complex were characterized by various analytical techniques including: differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), particle size, surface area, solubility, and dissolution rate. The co-grinded prednisone-Neusilin complex (1:7) was blended with other excipients and was formulated into a 2-mm diameter mini-tablet. The mini-tablets were further evaluated for thickness, weight, content uniformity, and dissolution rate. To improve taste masking and stability, mini-tablets were coated by dip coating with Eudragit(R) EPO solution. DSC and XRPD results showed that prednisone was transformed from crystalline state into amorphous state after co-grinding with Neusilin. Particle size, surface area, and SEM results confirmed that prednisone was adsorbed to Neusilin's surface. Co-grinded prednisone-Neusilin complex (1:7) had a solubility of 0.24 mg/mL and 90% dissolved within 20 min as compared to crystalline prednisone which had a solubility of 0.117 mg/mL and 30% dissolved within 20 min. The mini-tablets containing co-grinded prednisone-Neusilin complex (1:7) exhibited acceptable physicochemical and mechanical properties including dissolution rate enhancement. These mini-tablets were successfully dip coated in Eudragit(R) EPO solution to mask the taste of the drug during swallowing. This work illustrates the potential use of co-grinded prednisone-Neusilin to enhance solubility and dissolution rate as well as incorporation into a mini-tablet formulation for pediatric use.

Abstract:AIM: To develop a simple assay for the capture and detection of rare cancer cells in whole blood using iron oxide-gold (IO-Au) nanoparticles. MATERIALS & METHODS: IO-Au nanoovals (NOVs) were synthesized, coated with Raman tags and linked with antibodies targeting breast cancer. An integrated system was constructed for on-line magnetic cell capture and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection. The capabilities of IO-Au SERS NOVs to capture and detect rare cancer cells in blood were investigated in the integrated system using circulating tumor cell-mimic SK-BR-3 cells. RESULTS: SK-BR-3 cells in whole blood were magnetically captured under a flow condition using IO-Au SERS NOVs, followed by on-line SERS detection with a limit of detection of 1-2 cells/ml blood. CONCLUSION: We developed a sensitive method that can capture and detect cancer cells in whole blood with a single nanoconstruct, which is highly promising for the detection of circulating tumor cells in the clinic.

Abstract:The ABC transporter ABCC4 is recognized as an ATP-dependent exporter of endogenous substances as well as an increasing variety of anionic chemotherapeutics. A loss-of-function variant of zebrafish Abcc4 was identified with a single amino acid substitution in the cytoplasmic loop T804M. Because this substituted amino acid is highly conserved among ABCC4 orthologs and is located in cytoplasmic loop 3 (CL3), we investigated the impact of this mutation on human and zebrafish Abcc4 expression. We demonstrate that zebrafish Abcc4 T804M or human ABCC4 T796M exhibit substantially reduced expression, coupled with impaired plasma membrane localization. To understand the molecular basis for the localization defect, we developed a homology model of zebrafish Abcc4. The homology model suggested that the bulky methionine substitution disrupted side-chain contacts. Molecular dynamic simulations of a fragment of human or zebrafish CL3 containing a methionine substitution indicated altered helicity coupled with reduced thermal stability. Trifluoroethanol challenge coupled with circular dichroism revealed that the methionine substitution disrupted the ability of this fragment of CL3 to readily form an alpha-helix. Furthermore, expression and plasma membrane localization of these mutant ABCC4/Abcc4 proteins are mostly rescued by growing cells at subphysiological temperatures. Because the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (ABCC7) is closely related to ABCC4, we extended this by engineering certain pathogenic CFTR-CL3 mutations, and we showed they destabilized human and zebrafish ABCC4. Altogether, our studies provide the first evidence for a conserved domain in CL3 of ABCC4 that is crucial in ensuring its proper plasma membrane localization.

Title:Personality dysfunction in adults who stutter: another look.
Authors:['Manning W', 'Beck JG']
Affiliation:School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. wmanning@memphis.edu
Abstract:PURPOSE: Given reports of the frequent occurrence of personality disorders (PD) among individuals who stutter, this investigation was designed to determine the presence of personality disorders (PD) for individuals seeking treatment for stuttering, using a different self-report measure. METHOD: The sample included 50 adults who were undergoing treatment for stuttering. The participants also completed a self-report measure (Assessment of the DSM-IV Personality Disorders, ADP-IV) that is known to have good differential validity in the assessment of personality disorders as well as good convergent validity with a structured interview administered by a skilled mental health professional. RESULTS: Four participants met threshold values for one personality disorder (PD) and one participant met criteria for two personality disorders. The remaining 45 participants (90%) did not meet criteria for a PD. CONCLUSION: Rates of observed PDs in this sample approximated rates that have been observed in general community samples using structured clinical interviews and trained interviewers. Related reports which have claimed high levels of personality disorders among adults who stutter appear to be inflated by the use of self-report devices that overestimate the occurrence and co-morbidity of these conditions. Implications for the treatment of adults who stutter are discussed. EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES: The reader will be able to (a) summarize two basic perspectives of how individuals who stutter are influenced by the possibility of personality dysfunction (b) describe the factors that influence the detection of personality dysfunction using self-report procedures, discuss the important (c) theoretical and (d) clinical implications of accurately identifying personality dysfunction for adults who stutter.

Abstract:Astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme) is the most common and most malignant tumor of the central nervous system and is currently noncurable. Here, we have examined a population-based cohort of 47 patients with grade IV astrocytoma, who underwent tumor surgery at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Sweden and who survived after surgery for less than 200 days (short survivors, 28 patients) and more than 500 days (long survivors, 19 patients). For each tumor, we ascertained information on patient age, sex, tumor location, oncological treatment, and survival after surgery. The analysis of the tumor volume and the extent of tumor resection (incomplete versus complete resection of the macroscopic tumor) was made retrospectively from the preoperative radiological investigations and, when available, also from postoperative radiology. We performed semiquantitative immunohistochemical evaluation of the presence of intermediate filament (nanofilament) proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, nestin, and synemin in tumor cells. The intermediate filament system helps cells and tissues to cope with various types of stress, and thus, it might affect the malignant potential of grade IV astrocytoma. We propose a subclassification of astrocytomas grade IV with respect to the expression of the intermediate filament proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, nestin, and synemin, namely, type A, B, and C. Our results suggest that the expression of the intermediate filament proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, nestin, and synemin is coregulated in grade IV astrocytomas. The expression patterns of the intermediate filament proteins in astrocytoma type A, B, and C might have biological and clinical significance.

Abstract:Autotaxin (ATX), a lysophospholipase D, plays an important role in cancer invasion, metastasis, tumor progression, tumorigenesis, neuropathic pain, fibrotic diseases, cholestatic pruritus, lymphocyte homing, and thrombotic diseases by producing the lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). A high-throughput screen of ATX inhibition using the lysophosphatidylcholine-like substrate fluorogenic substrate 3 (FS-3) and approximately 10,000 compounds from the University of Cincinnati Drug Discovery Center identified several small-molecule inhibitors with IC(5)(0) vales ranging from nanomolar to low micromolar. The pharmacology of the three most potent compounds: 918013 (1; 2,4-dichloro-N-(3-fluorophenyl)-5-(4-morpholinylsulfonyl) benzamide), 931126 (2; 4-oxo-4-{2-[(5-phenoxy-1H-indol-2-yl)carbonyl]hydrazino}-N-(4-phenylbutan-2-yl)bu tanamide), and 966791 (3; N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-2-[N-(2-furylmethyl)(4-(1,2,3,4-tetraazolyl)phenyl)carbony lamino]-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) acetamide), were further characterized in enzyme, cellular, and whole animal models. Compounds 1 and 2 were competitive inhibitors of ATX-mediated hydrolysis of the lysophospholipase substrate FS-3. In contrast, compound 3 was a competitive inhibitor of both FS-3 and the phosphodiesterase substrate p-nitrophenyl thymidine 5'-monophosphate. Computational docking and mutagenesis suggested that compounds 1 and 2 target the hydrophobic pocket, thereby blocking access to the active site of ATX. The potencies of compounds 1-3 were comparable to each other in each of the assays. All of these compounds significantly reduced invasion of A2058 human melanoma cells in vitro and the colonization of lung metastases by B16-F10 murine melanoma cells in C57BL/6 mice. The compounds had no agonist or antagonist effects on select LPA or sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors, nor did they inhibit nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (NPP) enzymes NPP6 and NPP7. These results identify the molecular surface of the hydrophobic pocket of ATX as a target-binding site for inhibitors of enzymatic activity.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Polyurea crosslinked silica aerogels are highly porous, lightweight, and mechanically strong materials with great potential for in vivo applications. Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated the biocompatibility of this type of aerogel. The highly porous nature of aerogels allows for exceptional thermal, electric, and acoustic insulating capabilities that can be taken advantage of for non-invasive external imaging techniques. Sound-based detection of implants is a low cost, non-invasive, portable, and rapid technique that is routinely used and readily available in major clinics and hospitals. METHODOLOGY: In this study the first in vivo ultrasound response of polyurea crosslinked silica aerogel implants was investigated by means of a GE Medical Systems LogiQe diagnostic ultrasound machine with a linear array probe. Aerogel samples were inserted subcutaneously and sub-muscularly in a) fresh animal model and b) cadaveric human model for analysis. For comparison, samples of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were also imaged under similar conditions as the aerogel samples. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Polyurea crosslinked silica aerogel (X-Si aerogel) implants were easily identified when inserted in either of the regions in both fresh animal model and cadaveric model. The implant dimensions inferred from the images matched the actual size of the implants and no apparent damage was sustained by the X-Si aerogel implants as a result of the ultrasonic imaging process. The aerogel implants demonstrated hyperechoic behavior and significant posterior shadowing. Results obtained were compared with images acquired from the PDMS implants inserted at the same location.

Title:Tele-ICU: efficacy and cost-effectiveness of remotely managing critical care.
Authors:['Kumar S', 'Merchant S', 'Reynolds R']
Affiliation:Department of Health Informatics and Information Management, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:Tele-ICU is the use of an off-site command center in which a critical care team (intensivists and critical care nurses) is connected with patients in distant ICUs to exchange health information through real-time audio, visual, and electronic means. The aim of this study is to review the available literature related to the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of tele-ICU applications and to study the possible barriers to broader adoption. While the available studies draw conclusions on cost based on mortality and length of stay, actual costs were not reported. Another problem with the studies is the lack of consistent measurement, reporting, and adjustment for patient severity. From the data available, tele-ICU seems to be a promising path, especially in the United States, where there is a limited number of board-certified intensivists.

Abstract:Autotaxin (ATX) catalyzes the conversion of lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Both ATX and LPA have been linked to pathophysiologies ranging from cancer to neuropathic pain. Inhibition of LPA production by ATX is therefore of therapeutic interest. Here we report the application of previously-developed, subsite-targeted pharmacophore models in a screening workflow that involves either docking or binary QSAR as secondary filters to identify ATX inhibitors from previously unreported structural types, four of which have sub-micromolar inhibition constants. Cell-based assays demonstrate that ATX inhibition and cytotoxicity structure-activity-relationships (SAR) exhibit selectivity cliffs, characterized by structurally similar compounds exhibiting similar biological activities with respect to ATX inhibition but very different biological activities with respect to cytotoxicity. Thus, general cytotoxicity should not be used as an early filter to eliminate candidate ATX inhibitor scaffolds from further SAR studies. Assays using two substrates of vastly different sizes demonstrate that the tools developed to identify compounds binding outside the central core of the active site did identify compounds acting at an allosteric site. In contrast, tools developed to identify active-site directed compounds did not identify active-site directed compounds. The stronger volume overlap imposed when selecting screening candidates expected to bind outside the active site is likely responsible for the stronger match between intended and actual target site.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Soldiers returning from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom experience polytrauma injuries including traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury is often complicated by symptoms of insomnia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and pain that can impact treatment and rehabilitation. METHODS: The medical records of 137 veterans seen at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center Polytrauma clinic who sustained traumatic brain injury in combat were reviewed for this study. Demographic variables include age, sex, ethnicity, military branch, and service connection. Outcome measures include PTSD, pain, and insomnia. RESULTS: Analyses revealed a high prevalence of PTSD, insomnia, and pain co-occurring in 51.8% of veterans. Increased PTSD symptomatology was significantly correlated with reports of more pain severity (r = 0.53), pain interference (r = 0.61), and insomnia (r = 0.67). Further analyses, controlling for service connection, indicated that insomnia partially mediated the relation between PTSD and both pain severity and interference. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the overlap and complexity of presenting complaints in veterans and help identify the role of sleep disturbances in complicating diagnosis and treatment of veterans. As sleep problems reduce pain tolerance and exacerbate other symptoms, such as cognitive deficits and irritability, failure to address sleep disturbances may compromise rehabilitation efforts, suggesting the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach to assessing and treating these veterans.

Title:Properties of open-cell porous metals and alloys for orthopaedic applications.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, 38152-3180, USA, glewis@memphis.edu.
Abstract:One shortcoming of metals and alloys used to fabricate various components of orthopaedic systems, such as the femoral stem of a total hip joint replacement and the tibial plate of a total knee joint replacement, is well-recognized. This is that the material modulus of elasticity (E') is substantially larger than that of the contiguous cancellous bone, a consequence of which is stress shielding which, in turn, has been postulated to be implicated in a cascade of events that culminates in the principal life-limiting phenomenon of these systems, namely, aseptic loosening. Thus, over the years, a host of research programs have focused on the synthesis of metallic biomaterials whose E' can be tailored to match that of cancellous bone. The present work is a review of the extant large volume of literature on these materials, which are called open-cell porous metals/alloys (or, sometimes, metal foams or cellular materials). As such, its range is wide, covering myriad aspects such as production methods, characterization studies, in vitro evaluations, and in vivo performance. The review also includes discussion of seven areas for future research, such as parametric studies of the influence of an assortment of process variables (such as the space holder material and the laser power in the space holder method and the laser-engineered net-shaping process, respectively) on various properties (notably, permeability, fatigue strength, and corrosion resistance) of a given porous metal/alloy, innovative methods of determining fatigue strength, and modeling of corrosion behavior.

Abstract:The purposes of this study were to establish stability reliability of a measure of lower-body anaerobic power, the Kansas squat test (KST), and to compare the KST with the commonly used Wingate anaerobic test (WAnT) for lower-body power. Fourteen resistance-trained men (mean +/- SD; age = 24.2 +/- 3.6 years) performed both the KST and the WAnT twice on separate occasions. The KST consisted of using an external dynamometer to measure mean repetition power while performing 15 repetitions of speed squats using 70% of 1 repetition maximum system mass (barbell + body mass), initiating each repetition at 6-second intervals. Repetition power, mean power for all 15 repetitions, and % fatigue for the KST were all reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.754-0.937; p </= 0.05). There were no differences between tests for the mean power for all repetitions or relative fatigue (p </= 0.05) and no significant differences between tests for any individual repetition (test x repetition interaction, p < 0.05). Although absolute values were different (p > 0.05), significant correlations were found between the KST and WAnT for mean (r = 0.752) and maximum (r = 0.775) test powers but not for relative fatigue (r = 0.174). Lactate (HLa) responses were greater for the WAnT compared with the KST. These data indicate that the KST is reliable for resistance-trained men, and that measures of maximum and mean test powers for the KST are highly correlated to those values for the WAnT, but fatigue rates and HLa responses were not correlated. It appears that the KST is a lifting-specific anaerobic power and power endurance test that emphasizes phosphagen metabolism and may be used to assess training-induced changes in lower-body power.

Abstract:Creative use of new mobile and wearable health information and sensing technologies (mHealth) has the potential to reduce the cost of health care and improve well-being in numerous ways. These applications are being developed in a variety of domains, but rigorous research is needed to examine the potential, as well as the challenges, of utilizing mobile technologies to improve health outcomes. Currently, evidence is sparse for the efficacy of mHealth. Although these technologies may be appealing and seemingly innocuous, research is needed to assess when, where, and for whom mHealth devices, apps, and systems are efficacious. In order to outline an approach to evidence generation in the field of mHealth that would ensure research is conducted on a rigorous empirical and theoretic foundation, on August 16, 2011, researchers gathered for the mHealth Evidence Workshop at NIH. The current paper presents the results of the workshop. Although the discussions at the meeting were cross-cutting, the areas covered can be categorized broadly into three areas: (1) evaluating assessments; (2) evaluating interventions; and (3) reshaping evidence generation using mHealth. This paper brings these concepts together to describe current evaluation standards, discuss future possibilities, and set a grand goal for the emerging field of mHealth research.

Title:Hemodynamic and hematologic profile of healthy adults ingesting dietary supplements containing 1,3-dimethylamylamine and caffeine.
Authors:['Farney TM', 'McCarthy CG', 'Canale RE', 'Allman RJ Jr', 'Bloomer RJ']

Abstract:BACKGROUND: 1,3-dimethylamylamine (a constituent of geranium), alone and in combination with caffeine, is widely used within dietary supplements. We have recently determined the hemodynamic effects of 1,3-dimethylamylamine and caffeine alone and in combination, using a single ingestion study. However, no study has determined the hemodynamic effects of these ingredients following chronic use. Moreover, no study has determined the effects of these ingredients on bloodborne variables related to health and safety. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to assess the hemodynamic and hematologic profile of two different dietary supplements containing 1,3-dimethylamylamine and caffeine (in addition to other ingredients), before and after two weeks of daily intake. METHODS: 7 men (24.9 +/- 4.2 yrs) ingested the dietary supplement Jack3d, while 4 men and 2 women (22.5 +/- 1.8 yrs) ingested the dietary supplement OxyELITE Pro once per day for two weeks. On days 1 and 15, resting heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP), and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were measured and rate pressure product (RPP) was calculated. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for complete blood counts, comprehensive metabolic panel, and lipid panel. These tests were done prior to ingestion of supplement. On days 1 and 15 following blood collection, subjects ingested the assigned supplement (2 servings) and HR, SBP, DBP, and RPP were recorded at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-ingestion. RESULTS: After 14 days of treatment, resting HR, SBP, DBP, and RPP were not increased (P > 0.05). No significant changes were noted in any measured bloodborne variable, with the exception of an increase in fasting blood glucose with ingestion of Jack3d (P = 0.02). In response to acute intake of the supplements, HR, DBP, and RPP were not increased statistically (P > 0.05). SBP was increased with OxyELITE Pro (P = 0.03), but not with Jack3d (P = 0.09). Compared to pre-ingestion and in general, both supplements resulted in an increase in SBP, DBP, and RPP from 5%-15%, with a peak occurring at the 60 or 90 minute post-ingestion time. CONCLUSION: Acute ingestion of OxyELITE Pro, but not Jack3d, results in an increase in SBP. Chronic intake of two servings per day of OxyELITE Pro or Jack3d over a 14 day period does not result in an elevation in resting HR, SBP, DBP, or RPP. No significant changes are noted in any measured bloodborne variable following 14 days of ingestion, with the exception of blood glucose with Jack3d. Longer term intervention studies inclusive of larger sample sizes are needed to extend these findings.

Title:Biochemical and anthropometric effects of a weight loss dietary supplement in healthy men and women.
Authors:['McCarthy CG', 'Canale RE', 'Alleman RJ Jr', 'Reed JP', 'Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: We have recently noted an acute increase in circulating free fatty acids and glycerol, as well as resting metabolic rate, when men and women ingested the dietary supplement OxyELITE Pro in a single dose. We have also noted a reduction in appetite when subjects were treated with this supplement for 14 consecutive days. It is possible that such findings may favor body weight and fat loss over time. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of this dietary supplement on weight loss and associated markers using an eight week intervention. METHODS: Exercise-trained subjects were randomly assigned in double blind manner to ingest either the dietary supplement (n = 16; aged 22.8 +/- 0.7) or a placebo (n = 16; 22.5 +/- 0.5) every day for eight weeks. Body weight, body composition, skinfold thickness, serum lipids, and appetite were measured as the primary outcome variables. As measures of supplement safety, a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were performed, and resting heart rate and blood pressure were measured (pre and post intervention). RESULTS: No interactions or main effects were noted for our primary outcome measures (P > 0.05). However, when comparing pre and post intervention values for the supplement, significant decreases were noted in appetite, body weight, body fat percentage, and skinfold thickness (P < 0.05), while increases were noted for total and HDL-C, as well as for resting heart rate (P < 0.05). No changes were noted for placebo from pre to post intervention (P > 0.05), with the exception of an increase in HDL-C (P < 0.05). Blood pressure and bloodborne safety variables were not differently impacted by supplement or placebo (P > 0.05), with the exception of monocytes, for which an interaction effect was noted (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the dietary supplement OxyELITE Pro may assist in weight and body fat loss in a sample of exercise-trained men and women. The supplement does not result in any adverse effects pertaining to resting blood pressure or bloodborne markers of safety; however a small increase in resting heart rate is observed.

Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, Department of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Dietary supplements are often marketed to increase lipolysis and thermogenesis, with the proposed end result being weight loss and body fat reduction. It was the purpose of the present investigation to study the acute effects of a weight/fat loss supplement within a sample of healthy human subjects. METHODS: Twelve subjects (men 24.8 +/- 4.3 yrs; women 22.8 +/- 0.4 yrs) ingested a dietary supplement (OxyELITE Pro) or a placebo, on two separate days in a double-blind, cross-over design. Blood samples were collected immediately before ingestion, and at 60 and 120 minutes post ingestion, and analyzed for plasma glycerol and free fatty acids (FFA). Breath samples were collected immediately before ingestion and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post ingestion, for a measure of kilocalorie expenditure using indirect calorimetry. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded at all times and rate pressure product (RPP) was calculated. RESULTS: AUC was greater for supplement compared to placebo for glycerol (22.74 +/- 1.98 mug . mL(-1) . 2 hr(-1) vs. 15.76 +/- 1.36 mug . mL(-1) . 2 hr(-1); P = 0.001), FFA (1.62 +/- 0.07 mmol . L(-1) . 2 hr(-1) vs. 0.78 +/- 0.12 mmol . L(-1) . 2 hr(-1); P < 0.0001), and kilocalorie expenditure (149 +/- 7 kcal . 2 hr(-1) vs. 122 +/- 8 kcal . 2 hr(-1); P = 0.005). Heart rate (P = 0.02), systolic blood pressure (P < 0.0001), and RPP (P = 0.002) were higher for supplement compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Ingestion of OxyELITE Pro resulted in an increase in blood markers of lipolysis, as well as metabolic rate, during a two-hour post ingestion time period. An increase in hemodynamic variables was also observed. These findings are in reference to a sample of healthy men and women who were naive to treatment with the dietary supplement. Additional work is needed to determine if the acute changes observed here would persist with chronic use of the supplement and possibly lead to weight/body fat loss over time.

Title:Impact of a dietary supplement containing 1,3-dimethylamylamine on blood pressure and bloodborne markers of health: a 10-week intervention study.
Authors:['Whitehead PN', 'Schilling BK', 'Farney TM', 'Bloomer RJ']
Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: 1,3-dimethylamylamine is a commonly used ingredient within dietary supplements. Our prior work with this agent indicates a transient increase in blood pressure (systolic in particular) following oral ingestion of a single dosage, but no significant increase in resting blood pressure following chronic ingestion. Moreover, intervention studies involving both two and eight weeks of treatment with finished products containing 1,3-dimethylamylamine indicate minimal or no change in bloodborne markers of health. The present study sought to extend these findings by using a 10-week intervention trial to determine the change in selected markers of health in a sample of men. METHODS: 25 healthy men were randomly assigned to either a placebo (n = 13) or to a supplement containing 1,3-dimethylamylamine (n = 12) for a period of 10 weeks. Before and after the intervention, resting blood pressure and heart rate were measured, and blood samples were collected for determination of complete blood count, metabolic panel, and lipid panel. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted between conditions for blood pressure (P > 0.05), although systolic blood pressure increased approximately 6 mmHg with the supplement (diastolic blood pressure decreased approximately 4 mmHg). A main effect for time was noted for heart rate (P = 0.016), with values decreasing from pre to post intervention. There were significant main effects for time for creatinine (increased from pre to post intervention; P = 0.043) and alkaline phosphatase (decreased from pre to post intervention; P = 0.009), with no condition differences noted (P > 0.05). There was a significant interaction noted for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P = 0.043), with values decreasing in the supplement group from pre to post intervention approximately 7 mg . dL(-1) (P = 0.034). No other effects of significance were noted for bloodborne variables. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that a dietary supplement containing 1,3-dimethylamylamine does not result in a statistically significant increase in resting heart rate or blood pressure (although systolic blood pressure is increased approximately 6 mmHg with supplement use). The supplement does not negatively impact bloodborne markers of health. Further study is needed involving a longer intervention period, a larger sample size, and additional measures of health and safety.

Abstract:AIM: How do athletes control their foot movement so they can react fast in sports? Which component of the process may be more sensitive to training? These questions related to athletes' agility performance have long been important to the field of sport sciences, but are still unclear. The present study used surface electromyography (EMG) on the tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius medial (GM) of both left and right to assess if there would be any different contributions between premotor time (PRT) and motor time (MT) to the overall reaction time (RT). METHODS: Fifty-five right-footed male college athletes (M=20.62 years old; SD=1.01) were required to respond to a random visual stimulus using foot movement as fast as possible in four different directions (i.e., forward and backward in their left or right foot). RESULTS: High correlation coefficients between PMT and RT in all four directions (ranging from 0.866 to 0.909) were revealed, but not between MT and RT (ranging from 0.131 to 0.336). Lateral and sagittal axes significantly interacted based on RT. The left forward direction was slowest among all directions. CONCLUSION: The process of decision making, not the preparation of execution, plays a significant role in fast and accurate reactive responses; the slowest RT in the forward direction of the left foot may be related to response programming. The corresponding training should be emphasized in order to improve athletes' agility performance.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Nonexamination of lymph nodes is an extreme example of the variability of pathologic nodal staging of non-small cell lung cancer. We compared the prevalence, characteristics, and survival of patients without lymph nodes (pNX) to patients with documented pathologic N0 and pathologic N1 non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was done of non-small cell lung cancer resections in the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 1998 to 2009. RESULTS: Thirteen percent of all resections (18% of node negative resections) were pNX, including 6% of all node-negative lobar or greater resections and 51% of sublobar resections. Thirty-five percent of pNX resections were lobar or greater compared with 90% of pathologic N0 (p < 0.0001). Advanced age and surgery in rural locations were also significantly associated with pNX resection. The median duration of survival was 3 years in the pNX cohort, 6.4 years in the N0 cohort (p < 0.0001), and 2.8 years in the N1 group, with respective 5-year survival rates of 47%, 67%, and 45% (p < 0.0001). These survival differences remained after adjustment for potentially confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pNX resections are a high-risk subset, with survival approximating pathologic N1, not N0. They should have further attempts at retrieving lymph nodes for examination or be offered postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. We predict that treatment modalities that fail to address lymph nodes are likely to yield inferior survival in comparison to surgery with proper lymph node examination. The proportion of pNX lung resections may be a sentinel quality indicator for lung cancer programs.

Abstract:Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) alters brain dopamine (DA) concentrations and DA receptor/transporter function, suggesting the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse acting on the DA system may be affected by PCB exposure. Female Long-Evans rats were orally exposed to 0, 3, or 6 mg/kg/day PCBs from 4 weeks prior to breeding until litters were weaned on postnatal day 21. In vivo fixed potential amperometry (FPA) was used in adult anesthetized offspring to determine whether perinatal PCB exposure altered (1) presynaptic DA autoreceptor (DAR) sensitivity, (2) electrically evoked nucleus accumbens (NAc) DA efflux following administration of cocaine, and (3) the rate of depletion of presynaptic DA stores. One adult male and female littermate were tested using FPA following a single injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg ip), whereas a second adult male and female littermate were tested following the last of seven daily cocaine injections of the same dose. The carbon fiber recording microelectrode was positioned in the NAc core, and DA oxidation currents (i.e., DA release) evoked by brief stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) were quantified before and after administration of cocaine. PCB-exposed rats exhibited enhanced stimulation-evoked DA release (relative to baseline) following a single injection of cocaine. Although nonexposed controls exhibited typical DA sensitization following repeated cocaine administration, this effect was attenuated in PCB-exposed rats. In addition, DAR sensitivity was higher (males only), and the rate of depletion of presynaptic DA stores was greater in PCB-exposed animals relative to nonexposed controls. These results indicate that perinatal PCB exposure can modify DA synaptic transmission in the NAc in a manner previously shown to alter the reinforcing properties of cocaine.

Title:Influence of acute coffee consumption on postprandial oxidative stress.
Authors:['Bloomer RJ', 'Trepanowski JF', 'Farney TM']
Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, Department of Health and Sport Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Coffee has been reported to be rich in antioxidants, with both acute and chronic consumption leading to enhanced blood antioxidant capacity. High-fat feeding is known to result in excess production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, promoting a condition of postprandial oxidative stress. METHODS: We tested the hypothesis that coffee intake following a high-fat meal would attenuate the typical increase in blood oxidative stress during the acute postprandial period. On 3 different occasions, 16 men and women consumed a high-fat milk shake followed by either 16 ounces of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee or bottled water. Blood samples were collected before and at 2 and 4 hours following intake of the milk shake and analyzed for triglycerides (TAG), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). RESULTS: Values for TAG and MDA (P < 0.001), as well as for H2O2 (P < 0.001), increased significantly following milk shake consumption, with values higher at 4 hours compared with 2 hours post consumption for TAG and H2O2 (P < 0.05). TEAC was unaffected by the milk shake consumption. Coffee had no impact on TAG, MDA, H2O2, or TEAC, with no condition or interaction effects noted for any variable (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Acute coffee consumption following a high-fat milk shake has no impact on postprandial oxidative stress.

Title:A strategy to model nonmonotonic dose-response curve and estimate IC50.
Authors:['Zhang H', 'Holden-Wiltse J', 'Wang J', 'Liang H']
Affiliation:Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. hui.zhang@stjude.org
Abstract:The half-maximal inhibitory concentration IC[Formula: see text] is an important pharmacodynamic index of drug effectiveness. To estimate this value, the dose response relationship needs to be established, which is generally achieved by fitting monotonic sigmoidal models. However, recent studies on Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) mutants developing resistance to antiviral drugs show that the dose response curve may not be monotonic. Traditional models can fail for nonmonotonic data and ignore observations that may be of biologic significance. Therefore, we propose a nonparametric model to describe the dose response relationship and fit the curve using local polynomial regression. The nonparametric approach is shown to be promising especially for estimating the IC[Formula: see text] of some HIV inhibitory drugs, in which there is a dose-dependent stimulation of response for mutant strains. This model strategy may be applicable to general pharmacologic, toxicologic, or other biomedical data that exhibits a nonmonotonic dose response relationship for which traditional parametric models fail.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Estimation of the risk of adverse long-term outcomes such as second malignant neoplasms and infertility often requires reproducible quantification of exposures. The method for quantification should be easily utilized and valid across different study populations. The widely used Alkylating Agent Dose (AAD) score is derived from the drug dose distribution of the study population and thus cannot be used for comparisons across populations as each will have a unique distribution of drug doses. METHODS: We compared the performance of the Cyclophosphamide Equivalent Dose (CED), a unit for quantifying alkylating agent exposure independent of study population, to the AAD. Comparisons included associations from three Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) outcome analyses, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and goodness of fit based on the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). RESULTS: The CED and AAD performed essentially identically in analyses of risk for pregnancy among the partners of male CCSS participants, risk for adverse dental outcomes among all CCSS participants and risk for premature menopause among female CCSS participants, based on similar associations, lack of statistically significant differences between the areas under the ROC curves and similar model fit values for the AIC between models including the two measures of exposure. CONCLUSION: The CED is easily calculated, facilitating its use for patient counseling. It is independent of the drug dose distribution of a particular patient population, a characteristic that will allow direct comparisons of outcomes among epidemiological cohorts. We recommend the use of the CED in future research assessing cumulative alkylating agent exposure.

Abstract:This study analyzed the top 3 successful snatch attempts by individual lifters in each weight class at a U.S. National Championship weightlifting meet. Two-dimensional (2-D) body position and characteristics of the lifts were compared via 2D video analysis in groups of lifters who displaced forward, showed no displacement, or displaced backward to receive the bar. No significant group differences (p > 0.05) were noted for body mass, bar mass, or hip angle. The rearward displacement group had a significantly greater horizontal distance between the shoulder and heel at the end of the pull (determined as the point where the bar ceases to accelerate vertically). Hip angles for the no displacement group had a small-to-moderate effect size (0.50) in comparison to the forward displacement group, but they only showed a small effect size (0.17) when compared with the rearward displacement group. The forward displacement group showed a small-to-moderate effect size compared with both the no displacement group (0.51) and the rearward displacement group (0.55) concerning the horizontal distance from the shoulder to the heel. These data seem to suggest that rearward displacement in the drop-under phase in the snatch is not detrimental to performance and actually seems to be a preferred technique in U.S. national level lifters. In addition to evidence that rearward displacement is exhibited in elite lifters and is coached globally, it seems this is the preferred technique in international competitions. This technique may be considered a viable variation of the snatch by coaches and athletes of all levels.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute effects of a nutritional supplement containing a proprietary blend of Phellodendron and Crape Myrtle on serum glucose and insulin in response to a modified oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). METHODS: Using a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, 10 exercise-trained, non-diabetic men reported to the lab in a 10 hour fasted state, on two different mornings separated by 1-2 weeks, and were subjected to an OGTT by ingesting a 75 gram dextrose solution. Fifteen minutes prior to the OGTT subjects ingested either a dietary supplement containing a blend of Phellodendron and Crape Myrtle (SUPP) or a placebo (PLA). Blood samples were collected before ingestion of the SUPP or PLA and at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 minutes post-ingestion of the dextrose load. Samples were analyzed for serum glucose and insulin. RESULTS: In relation to serum glucose, a condition effect was noted (P = 0.01), with values lower for SUPP compared to PLA. In relation to serum insulin, a trend for a condition effect was noted (P = 0.06), with values lower for SUPP compared to PLA. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that acute ingestion of a dietary supplement containing a blend of Phellodendron and Crape Myrtle can lower the serum glucose response to a modified OGTT, while resulting in a non-significant attenuation in insulin response. These data are specific to a small sample of exercise-trained, non-diabetic men.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Several isolated ingredients have been proposed to increase growth hormone (GH) release, including Chlorophytum borivilianum and Velvet bean. A combination of these two ingredients has been packaged within an investigational dietary supplement. It was the purpose of the present investigation to determine the impact of acute ingestion of this supplement on circulating GH in healthy, exercise-trained men. METHODS: Fifteen men ingested the dietary supplement on two different days, separated by one week. Blood was collected from subjects before ingestion of the supplement and at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 minutes post ingestion. GH was analyzed in serum samples using an ELISA method. Values for GH for each subject, at each collection time, were averaged over both test days and used in the main analysis. RESULTS: Serum GH increased over time, with higher values at 60 minutes (1.56 +/- 0.65 ng . mL(-1); P = 0.04; +767%), 80 minutes (1.76 +/- 0.69 ng . mL(-1); P = 0.02; +878%), and 100 minutes (1.48 +/- 0.62 ng . mL(-1); P = 0.05; +722%) compared to pre ingestion (0.18 +/- 0.04 ng . mL(-1)). A great deal of subject variability existed in the area under the curve (AUC) for GH, with pooled values ranging from 0.49 to 61.2 ng . mL(-1) . 2 hr(-1.) CONCLUSION: Acute ingestion of an investigational dietary supplement containing the active ingredients Chlorophytum borivilianum and Velvet bean results in an increase in circulating GH in exercise-trained men. Additional placebo controlled investigations are needed to extend these findings. Moreover, studies are needed to determine if chronic use of such supplementation leads to favorable changes in health-related parameters associated with increased circulating GH.

Abstract:Although many clinicians and researchers work to understand cancer, there has been limited success to effectively combine forces and collaborate over time, distance, data, and budget constraints. Here we present a workflow template for multidisciplinary cancer therapy that was developed during the 2nd Annual Workshop on Cancer Systems Biology sponsored by Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, in July 2012. The template was applied to the development of a metronomic therapy backbone for neuroblastoma. Three primary groups were identified: clinicians, biologists, and quantitative scientists (mathematicians, computer scientists, and engineers). The workflow described their integrative interactions; parallel or sequential processes; data sources and computational tools at different stages as well as the iterative nature of therapeutic development from clinical observations to in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials. We found that theoreticians in dialog with experimentalists could develop calibrated and parameterized predictive models that inform and formalize sets of testable hypotheses, thus speeding up discovery and validation while reducing laboratory resources and costs. The developed template outlines an interdisciplinary collaboration workflow designed to systematically investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of a new therapy and validate that therapy to advance development and clinical acceptance.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: A decline in hospitalizations and pain episodes among those with sickle cell disease (SCD) who take hydroxyurea (HU) has been shown when compared to pre-HU patterns but paradoxically, when compared to those who have never been treated, HU recipients often have more frequent hospitalizations. This analysis evaluates the impact of increasing usage of HU on trends in hospitalizations and blood transfusions within a large SCD treatment program. METHODS: Eligibility was restricted to patients with Hb SS or Hb Sbeta(0)-thalassemia who were 2-18 years old between 2006-2010 and received care at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (N = 508). Hospitalizations and blood transfusions were calculated for each of the years under study for those exposed and never exposed to HU. Differences in number of hospitalizations before and after HU initiation were compared. RESULTS: The proportion of patients receiving HU increased by 4% per year on average. In the HU exposed group, a modest decline in mean per-patient hospitalizations and per-patient hospital days occurred, while those never exposed to HU trended toward a slight increase over time. Rates of blood transfusions declined among those on HU but not in patients never exposed to HU. Patients on HU had a median of one fewer hospital admission in the year after initiation of HU, compared to the year prior. Two deaths occurred in the patient population, both of whom were not exposed to HU. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing usage of HU was concurrent with decreased hospitalization rates and blood transfusions. Our results support the utility of HU on decreasing hospitalizations and transfusions for patients with SCD outside of the clinical trial setting.

Abstract:Two Ptolemaic period mummies underwent head and neck examination including high-resolution tomography and endoscopic rhinoscopy and cranioscopy. The anatomy demonstrated characteristic laryngeal calcification and sexual dimorphism. Pathologic findings consisted of severe dental disease and possible chronic ear disease. Postmortem changes revealed the entrance of the embalmers into the cranial cavity, but raised interesting speculation regarding the method of brain removal.

Title:Loss of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal synaptic terminals precedes striatal projection neuron pathology in heterozygous Q140 Huntington's disease mice.

Abstract:Motor slowing, forebrain white matter loss, and striatal shrinkage have been reported in premanifest Huntington's disease (HD) prior to overt striatal neuron loss. We carried out detailed LM and EM studies in a genetically precise HD mimic, heterozygous Q140 HD knock-in mice, to examine the possibility that loss of corticostriatal and thalamostriatal terminals prior to striatal neuron loss underlies these premanifest HD abnormalities. In our studies, we used VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 immunolabeling to detect corticostriatal and thalamostriatal (respectively) terminals in dorsolateral (motor) striatum over the first year of life, prior to striatal projection neuron pathology. VGLUT1+ axospinous corticostriatal terminals represented about 55% of all excitatory terminals in striatum, and VGLUT2+ axospinous thalamostriatal terminals represented about 35%, with VGLUT1+ and VGLUT2+ axodendritic terminals accounting for the remainder. In Q140 mice, a significant 40% shortfall in VGLUT2+ axodendritic thalamostriatal terminals and a 20% shortfall in axospinous thalamostriatal terminals were already observed at 1 month of age, but VGLUT1+ terminals were normal in abundance. The 20% deficiency in VGLUT2+ thalamostriatal axospinous terminals persisted at 4 and 12 months in Q140 mice, and an additional 30% loss of VGLUT1+ corticostriatal terminals was observed at 12 months. The early and persistent deficiency in thalamostriatal axospinous terminals in Q140 mice may reflect a development defect, and the impoverishment of this excitatory drive to striatum may help explain early motor defects in Q140 mice and in premanifest HD. The loss of corticostriatal terminals at 1 year in Q140 mice is consistent with prior evidence from other mouse models of corticostriatal disconnection early during progression, and can explain both the measurable bradykinesia and striatal white matter loss in late premanifest HD.

Title:The effects of low levels of light at night upon the endocrine physiology of western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica).
Authors:['Schoech SJ', 'Bowman R', 'Hahn TP', 'Goymann W', 'Schwabl I', 'Bridge ES']
Affiliation:Department of Biological Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee.
Abstract:Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) in the suburbs breed earlier than jays in native habitat. Amongst the possible factors that influence this advance (e.g., food availability, microclimate, predator regime, etc.), is exposure to artificial lights at night (LAN). LAN could stimulate the reproductive axis of the suburban jays. Alternatively, LAN could inhibit pineal melatonin (MEL), thus removing its inhibitory influence on the reproductive axis. Because Florida scrub-jays are a threatened species, we used western scrub-jays (Aphelocoma californica) to investigate the effects of LAN upon reproductive hormones and melatonin. Jays were held under conditions in which the dark-phase of the light:dark cycle was without illumination and then under low levels of LAN. Under both conditions, birds were exposed first to short-days (9.5L:14.5D) that were gradually increased to long-days (14.5L:9.5D). At various times, blood samples were collected during the light part of the cycle to measure reproductive hormones (luteinizing hormone, LH; testosterone, T; and estradiol, E2 ). Similarly, samples to assess melatonin were collected during the dark. In males, LAN caused a depression in LH levels and levels were approximately 4x greater under long- than short-days. In females, there was no effect of LAN or photoperiod upon LH. LAN resulted in depressed T levels in females, although there was no effect on T in males. E2 levels in both sexes were lower under LAN than under an unlighted dark-phase. Paradoxically, MEL was higher in jays under LAN, and under long-days. MEL did not differ by sex. LAN disrupted the extraordinarily strong correlation between T and E2 that existed under unlighted nocturnal conditions. Overall, our findings fail to support the hypothesis that LAN stimulates the reproductive axis. Rather, the data demonstrate that LAN tends to inhibit reproductive hormone secretion, although not in a consistent fashion between the sexes.

Abstract:Effective vaccination is now available to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted infection and cause of cervical cancer. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of HPV vaccination among childhood cancer survivors and identify factors associated with HPV vaccine initiation and completion. Mothers of daughters of ages 9 to 17 years with/without a history of childhood cancer (n = 235, Mage = 13.2 years, SD = 2.69; n = 70, Mage = 13.3 years, SD = 2.47, respectively) completed surveys querying HPV vaccination initiation and completion along with sociodemographic, medical, HPV knowledge and communication, and health belief factors, which may relate to vaccination outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors that associate with HPV vaccination initiation and completion. Among cancer survivors, 32.6% initiated and 17.9% completed the three-dose vaccine series, whereas 34.3% and 20.0% of controls initiated and completed, respectively. Univariate analyses indicated no differences between cancer/no cancer groups on considered risk factors. Among all participants, multivariate logistic regression analyses found vaccine initiation associated with older age of daughter and physician recommendation, whereas increased perceived barriers associated with a decreased likelihood of initiation (all P < 0.05). Among those having initiated, risk factors for noncompletion included being non-White, increased perceived severity of HPV, and increased perceived barriers to vaccination (all P < 0.05). A minority of adolescents surviving childhood cancer has completed vaccination despite their increased risk for HPV-related complication. These results inform the prioritization of strategies to be included in vaccine promotion efforts.

Title:Phosphoryl transfers of the phospholipase D superfamily: a quantum mechanical theoretical study.

Abstract:The HKD-containing Phospholipase D superfamily catalyzes the cleavage of the headgroup of phosphatidylcholine to produce phosphatidic acid and choline. The mechanism of this cleavage process is studied theoretically. The geometric basis of our models is the X-ray crystal structure of the five-coordinate phosphohistidine intermediate from Streptomyces sp . Strain PMF (PDB Code = 1V0Y ). Hybrid ONIOM QM:QM methodology with Density Functional Theory (DFT) and semiempirical PM6 (DFT:PM6) is used to acquire thermodynamic and kinetic data for the initial phosphoryl transfer, subsequent hydrolysis, and finally, the formation of the experimentally observed ''dead-end'' phosphohistidine product (PDB Code = 1V0W ). The model contains nineteen amino acid residues (including the two highly conserved HKD-motifs), four explicit water molecules, and the substrate. Via computations, the persistence of the short-lived five-coordinate phosphorane intermediate on the minutes times scale is rationalized. This five-coordinate phosphohistidine intermediate energetically exists between the hydrolysis event and ''substrate reorganization'' (the reorganization of the in vitro model substrate within the active site). Computations directly support the thermodynamic favorability of the in vitro four-coordinate phosphohistidine product. In vivo, the activation energy of substrate reorganization is too high, perhaps due to a combination of substrate immobility when embedded in the lipid bilayer, as well as its larger steric bulk compared to the compound used in the in vitro substrate soaks. On this longer time scale, the enzyme will migrate along the lipid membrane toward its next substrate target, rather than promote the formation of the dead-end product.

Abstract:Capuramycin and its congeners are considered to be important lead molecules for the development of a new drug for multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Extensive structure-activity relationship studies of capuramycin to improve the efficacy have been limited because of difficulties in selectively chemically modifying the desired position(s) of the natural product with biologically interesting functional groups. We have developed efficient syntheses of capuramycin and its analogues by using new protecting groups, derived from the chiral (chloro-4-methoxyphenyl)(chlorophenyl)methanols, for the uridine ureido nitrogen and primary alcohol. The chiral nonracemic (2,6-dichloro-4-methoxyphenyl)(2,4-dichlorophenyl)methanol derivative is a useful reagent to resolve rac-3-amino-1,3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one, the (S)-configuration isomer of which plays a significant role in improving the mycobactericidal activity of capuramycin.

Abstract:Deposition of insoluble protein aggregates is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. The universal presence of beta-amyloid and tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has facilitated advancement of the amyloid cascade and tau hypotheses that have dominated AD pathogenesis research and therapeutic development. However, the underlying etiology of the disease remains to be fully elucidated. Here we report a comprehensive study of the human brain-insoluble proteome in AD by mass spectrometry. We identify 4,216 proteins, among which 36 proteins accumulate in the disease, including U1-70K and other U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) spliceosome components. Similar accumulations in mild cognitive impairment cases indicate that spliceosome changes occur in early stages of AD. Multiple U1 snRNP subunits form cytoplasmic tangle-like structures in AD but not in other examined neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Comparison of RNA from AD and control brains reveals dysregulated RNA processing with accumulation of unspliced RNA species in AD, including myc box-dependent-interacting protein 1, clusterin, and presenilin-1. U1-70K knockdown or antisense oligonucleotide inhibition of U1 snRNP increases the protein level of amyloid precursor protein. Thus, our results demonstrate unique U1 snRNP pathology and implicate abnormal RNA splicing in AD pathogenesis.

Title:Prostaglandin E(2) in tick saliva regulates macrophage cell migration and cytokine profile.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Ticks are obligate hematophagous ectoparasites that suppress the host's immune and inflammatory responses by secreting immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory molecules in their saliva. In previous studies we have shown that tick salivary gland extract (SGE) and saliva from Dermacentor variabilis have distinct effects on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated IC-21 macrophage and NIH3T3-L1 fibroblast migration. Since tick saliva contains a high concentration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a potent modulator of inflammation, we used a PGE2 receptor antagonist to evaluate the role of PGE2 in the different migratory responses induced by saliva and its impact on macrophage cytokine profile. METHODS: Adult ticks were fed on female New Zealand white rabbits for 5-8 days. Female ticks were stimulated with dopamine/theophylline to induce salivation and saliva was pooled. Competitive enzyme immunoassays (EIA) were used to measure saliva PGE2 content and the changes in macrophage intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. The effects of tick saliva on macrophage and fibroblast migration were assessed in the absence and presence of the PGE2 receptor antagonist, AH 6809, using blind well chamber assays. A cytokine antibody array was used to examine the effects of tick saliva on macrophage cytokine secretion. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA; Student Newman-Kuels post-test was used for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: The saliva-induced increase in PDGF-stimulated macrophage migration was reversed by AH 6809. The inhibition of PDGF-stimulated fibroblast migration by saliva was also antagonist-sensitive. Tick saliva induced macrophages to secrete copious amounts of PGE2, and conditioned medium from these cells caused an AH 6809-sensitive inhibition of stimulated fibroblast migration, showing that macrophages can regulate fibroblast activity. We show that tick saliva decreased the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines regulated and normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES/CCL5), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and soluble TNF receptor I (sTNFRI) through a PGE2-dependent mechanism mediated by cAMP. Saliva had similar effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that ticks utilize salivary PGE2 to subvert the ability of macrophages to secrete pro-inflammatory mediators and recruit fibroblasts to the feeding lesion, therefore inhibiting wound healing.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway activated by environmental nutrients that regulates gene transcription to control cell growth and proliferation. How TORC1 modulates chromatin structure to control gene expression, however, is largely unknown. Because TORC1 is a major transducer of environmental information, defining this process has critical implications for both understanding environmental effects on epigenetic processes and the role of aberrant TORC1 signaling in many diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: To elucidate the role of TORC1 signaling in chromatin regulation, we screened a budding yeast histone H3 and H4 mutant library using the selective TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin to identify histone residues functionally connected to TORC1. Intriguingly, we identified histone H3 lysine 37 (H3K37) as a residue that is essential during periods of limited TORC1 activity. An H3K37A mutation resulted in cell death by necrosis when TORC1 signaling was simultaneously impaired. The induction of necrosis was linked to alterations in high mobility group (HMG) protein binding to chromatin. Furthermore, the necrotic phenotype could be recapitulated in wild-type cells by deregulating the model HMG proteins, Hmo1 or Ixr1, thus implicating a direct role for HMG protein deregulation as a stimulus for inducing necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies histone H3 and H4 residues functionally required for TORC1-dependent cell growth and proliferation that are also candidate epigenetic pathways regulated by TORC1 signaling. It also demonstrates a novel role for H3K37 and TORC1 in regulating the binding of select HMG proteins to chromatin and that HMG protein deregulation can initiate a necrotic cell death response. Overall, the results from this study suggest a possible model by which chromatin anchors HMG proteins during periods of limited TORC1 signaling, such as that which occurs during conditions of nutrient stress, to suppress necrotic cell death.

Title:Direct and interactive influence of explanatory variables on properties of a calcium phosphate cement for vertebral body augmentation.
Authors:['Werdofa DM', 'Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN, 38152, USA.
Abstract:We used the response surface methodology to investigate the direct and interactive effects of three explanatory variables on three properties of a calcium phosphate cement (CPC) for use in vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP). The variables were poly(ethylene glycol) content of the cement liquid (PEG), powder-to-liquid ratio (PLR), and the amount of Na2HPO4 added to an aqueous solution of 4 wt/wt% poly(acrylic acid) (as the cement liquid) (SPC). The properties were injectability (I), final setting time (F), and 5-day compressive strength (UCS). We found that (1) there was an interactive effect between the variables on I and F but not on UCS; (2) the maximum I (98%) was obtained with PEG = 20 wt/wt% and PLR = 2 g mL(-1); (3) F = 15 min (the proposed optimum value for a CPC for use in VP and BKP) was obtained with PEG = 4 wt/wt% and PLR = 2.9 g mL(-1); and (4) the maximum UCS (39 MPa) was obtained with SPC = 0 and PLR = 3.5 g mL(-1).

Title:Mouthparts of southern leopard frog, Lithobates sphenocephalus, tadpoles not affected by exposure to a formulation of glyphosate.

Abstract:This study evaluated the impacts of Roundup(R) on tadpole mouthpart damage as a mechanism for reduced growth and developmental rates in Lithobates sphenocephalus (Southern leopard frog) tadpoles. We did not find evidence that Roundup((R)) damages larval mouthparts, nor was there a significant relationship between mouthpart damage and either body condition or developmental rate. However, the highest concentration of Roundup(R) significantly stunted development compared to all other treatments. Although we observed a significant effect of Roundup(R) on developmental rate, we conclude that mouthpart damage is likely not a mechanism for this life history response.

Title:Design of a first metatarsophalangeal joint simulator.
Authors:['Schlachter K', 'Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: The use of total first metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ) arthroplasty to treat patients in which the pain, due to a pathological joint, has not been relieved with a conservative method or for which the disease or disorder is at an advanced stage, is popular. Although meta-analysis of clinical results indicates that this surgical option is efficacious, there are problems with implant failure due to wear of the components. Although there is a plethora of designs of this type of implant in clinical use, there are no literature reports on total first MPJ simulators, which may be used to evaluate, for example, the wear rate of a total first MPJ implant. METHODS: We designed such a simulator, guided by the biomechanics of the joint. Thus, for example, the implant under test will be articulated at least 40 degrees dorsiflexion, under a 600 N loading, at 1 Hz. Furthermore, the testing stations will be configured to allow testing of any type of first MPJ implant. We also performed a finite element analysis (FEA) study of a model of an articulating station, subjected to a quasi-static load of 1200 N. RESULTS: For an articulating station, (1) the highest von Mises stress occurred at the implant-fixture interface; and (2), for the other parts, the minimum factor of safety, against elastic failure, is approximately 9. CONCLUSIONS: The designed joint simulator is mechanically sound and may be used for wear testing of any type of first MPJ implant.

Title:Tele-ICU: Efficacy and Cost-Effectiveness Approach of Remotely Managing the Critical Care.
Authors:['Kumar S', 'Merchant S', 'Reynolds R']
Affiliation:Department of Health Informatics & Information Management, University of Tennessee Health Science Center,920 Madison Avenue Suite 518, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.
Abstract:Tele-ICU has an off-site command center in which a critical care team (intensivists and critical care nurses) is connected with patients in distance intensive care units (ICUs) through a real-time audio, visual and electronic means and health information is exchanged. The aim of this paper is to review literature to explore the available studies related to efficacy and cost effectiveness of Tele-ICU applications and to study the possible barriers to broader adoption. While studies draw conclusions on cost based on the mortality and Length of Stay (LOS), actual cost was not reported. Another problem in the studies was the lack of consistent measurement, reporting and adjustment for patient severity. From the data available, Tele-ICU seems to be a promising path, especially in the United States where there is a limited number of board-certified intensivists.

Title:Potential role of Atp5g3 in epigenetic regulation of alcohol preference or obesity from a mouse genomic perspective.

Abstract:The mitochondrial ATP synthase, subunit c, isoform 3 gene (Atp5g3) encodes subunit 9, the subunit of the multisubunit enzyme that catalyzes ATP synthesis during oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. According to the Ensembl database, Atp5g3 in mice is located on chromosome 2 between 73746504 and 73749383 bp, within the genomic regions of two sets of quantitative trait loci - alcohol preference and body weight. Both of those traits are more influenced by epigenetic factors than many other traits are. Using currently available phenotype and gene expression profiles from the GeneNetwork database, we obtained correlations between Atp5g3 and alcoholism- and obesity-relevant phenotypes. The correlation in expression levels between Atp5g3 and each of its 12 partner genes in the molecular interaction are different in various tissues and genes. Transcriptome mapping indicated that Atp5g3 is differentially regulated in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and liver. Owing to a lack of known polymorphisms of Atp5g3 among three relevant mouse strains, C57BL/6J (B6), DBA/2J (D2), and BALB/ cJ, the molecular mechanism for the connection between Atp5g3 and alcoholism and body weight requires further investigation.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: 1,3-dimethylamylamine (DMAA) has been a component of dietary supplements and is also used within "party pills," often in conjunction with alcohol and other drugs. Ingestion of higher than recommended doses results in untoward effects including cerebral hemorrhage. To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to determine both the pharmacokinetic profile and physiologic responses of DMAA. METHODS: Eight men reported to the lab in the morning following an overnight fast and received a single 25 mg oral dose of DMAA. Blood samples were collected before and through 24 hours post-DMAA ingestion and analyzed for plasma DMAA concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Resting heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature was also measured. RESULTS: One subject was excluded from the data analysis due to abnormal DMAA levels. Analysis of the remaining seven participants showed DMAA had an oral clearance of 20.02 +/- 5 Lhr(-)(1), an oral volume of distribution of 236 +/- 38 L, and terminal half-life of 8.45 +/- 1.9 hr. Lag time, the delay in appearance of DMAA in the circulation following extravascular administration, varied among participants but averaged approximately 8 minutes (0.14 +/- 0.13 hr). The peak DMAA concentration for all subjects was observed within 3-5 hours following ingestion and was very similar across subjects, with a mean of ~70 ngmL(-)(1). Heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature were largely unaffected by DMAA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data to characterize the oral pharmacokinetic profile of DMAA. These findings indicate a consistent pattern of increase across subjects with regards to peak DMAA concentration, with peak values approximately 15-30 times lower than those reported in case studies linking DMAA intake with adverse events. Finally, a single 25 mg dose of DMAA does not meaningfully impact resting heart rate, blood pressure, or body temperature. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01765933.

Abstract:UNLABELLED: Although there have been substantial advancements in the treatment of inflammatory arthritis, treatments for osteoarthritis (OA) have lagged and currently are primarily palliative until joints become totally dysfunctional and prosthetic replacement is needed. One obstacle for developing a preventive therapy for OA is the lack of good tools for efficiently diagnosing the disease and monitoring its progression during the early stages when the effect of therapeutic drugs or biologics is most likely to be effective. We have developed near infrared immunoliposomes conjugated with type II collagen antibody for diagnosis and treatment of early OA. These immunoliposomes bind to damaged but not normal cartilage. Utilizing these reagents, we can quantitate exposure of type II collagen during cartilage degradation in individual joints in vivo in a guinea pig. Immunoliposomes could be used to determine the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in small animals as well as vehicles for localized drug delivery to OA chondrocytes. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: This team of authors have developed near infrared immunoliposomes conjugated with type II collagen antibody for diagnosis and treatment of early OA, with promising results demonstrated in a guinea pig model.

Abstract:In most vertebrates, production of reproductive hormones wanes with age, co-occurring with a decline in reproductive output. Measurement of these hormones can serve as a key marker of the onset of reproductive senescence. Longitudinal studies of physiological parameters in populations of free-living animals are relatively uncommon; however, we have monitored baseline concentrations of hormones for nine years in a population of Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens). We hypothesized that concentrations of circulating reproductive hormones change with age, and predicted declines in reproductive hormones in the oldest jays. We found that baseline levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (T) were relatively low in both young and old male breeders and reach their highest levels in birds aged 4-7years. Conversely, we found no age-related patterns in baseline levels of LH or estradiol in female jays. In males we determined which component of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is responsible for observed age-based differences, by challenging males of different ages with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH); thereby allowing assessment of pituitary and gonadal responsiveness by measuring plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone and testosterone, respectively. The magnitude of increase in levels of both LH and T in response to GnRH challenge decreased with age in male breeders. Combined with the baseline levels, the results from the GnRH challenge suggest that younger birds have the capability to produce higher levels of reproductive hormone, whereas the old birds may be constrained by senescence in their ability to produce these hormones.

Affiliation:Cardiorespiratory/Metabolic Laboratory, Department of Health and Sport Sciences, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN. rbloomer@memphis.edu.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Strenuous, high-volume exercise is often associated with inflammation and joint pain. Cissus quadrangularis (CQ) has been reported to have anti-inflammatory activity. The purpose of our study was to determine the therapeutic effects of CQ supplementation in healthy, exercise-trained men with joint-specific pain. METHODS: Twenty-nine men between the ages of 20 and 46 years, who reportedly experienced chronic joint pain as a result of strenuous exercise, participated in our pilot study. All men received CQ 3200 mg daily for 8 weeks. Before and after the 8-week intervention period, subjects completed a questionnaire to determine their degree of joint pain (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index of Osteoarthritis [WOMAC]). Clinical measures (eg, heart rate, blood pressure, blood biomarkers) were also collected for each subject pre- (baseline) and post-intervention. RESULTS: Subject ratings for multiple variables within the WOMAC Index improved (decreased) significantly (P < 0.05), with the subject mean total WOMAC score decreasing from 25.4 +/- 2.4 to 17.4 +/- 2.1 (~31%), pre- to post-intervention. No clinical measure was significantly impacted by use of CQ supplementation. CONCLUSION: An 8-week course of supplementation with CQ reduced joint pain in a sample of 29 young, otherwise healthy, exercise-trained men. Additional study is needed to extend these findings, including comparison with a placebo-controlled cohort, and possibly, examining effects of CQ use in women and older adult subjects.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Higenamine, also known as norcoclaurine, is an herbal constituent thought to act as a beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist-possibly stimulating lipolysis. It was the purpose of this study to determine the impact of a higenamine-based dietary supplement on plasma free fatty acids and energy expenditure following acute oral ingestion. METHODS: Sixteen healthy subjects (8 men; 26.1 +/- 2.5 yrs; 8 women 22.4 +/- 3.1 yrs) ingested a dietary supplement containing a combination of higenamine, caffeine (270 mg), and yohimbe bark extract or a placebo, on two separate occasions in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design, separated by 6-8 days. Blood samples were collected immediately before ingestion, and at 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes post ingestion, and analyzed for plasma free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol. Breath samples were collected at the same times for a measure of kilocalorie expenditure and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) using indirect calorimetry. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded at all times. Data collection occurred in the morning following a 10 hour overnight fast. RESULTS: A condition effect was noted for both FFA (p < 0.0001) and kilocalorie expenditure (p = 0.001), with values higher for supplement compared to placebo at 60, 120, and 180 minutes post ingestion. No statistically significant effects were noted for glycerol or RER (p > 0.05). A condition effect was noted for heart rate (p = 0.03) and systolic blood pressure (p < 0.0001), with values higher for supplement compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Ingestion of a higenamine-based dietary supplement stimulates lipolysis and energy expenditure, as evidenced by a significant increase in circulating FFA and kilocalorie expenditure. The same supplement results in a moderate increase in heart rate (~3 bpm) and systolic blood pressure (~12 mmHg), which is consistent with previous studies evaluating moderate doses of caffeine and yohimbine, suggesting that higenamine contributes little to the increase in these hemodynamic variables. These findings are in reference to young, healthy and active men and women.

Title:Full-gestational exposure to nicotine and ethanol augments nicotine self-administration by altering ventral tegmental dopaminergic function due to NMDA receptors in adolescent rats.

Abstract:In adult rats, we have shown full-gestational exposure to nicotine and ethanol (Nic + EtOH) augmented nicotine self-administration (SA) (increased nicotine intake) compared to pair-fed (PF) offspring. Therefore, we hypothesized that full-gestational exposure to Nic + EtOH disrupts control of dopaminergic (DA) circuitry by ventral tegmental area (VTA) NMDA receptors, augmenting nicotine SA and DA release in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of adolescents. Both NAcc DA and VTA glutamate release were hyper-responsive to intra-VTA NMDA in Nic + EtOH offspring versus PF (p = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). Similarly, DA release was more responsive to i.v. nicotine in Nic + EtOH offspring (p = 0.02). Local DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid sodium salt (AP5) (NMDA receptor antagonist) infusion into the VTA inhibited nicotine-stimulated DA release in Nic + EtOH and PF offspring. Nicotine SA was augmented in adolescent Nic + EtOH versus PF offspring (p = 0.000001). Daily VTA microinjections of AP5 reduced nicotine SA by Nic + EtOH offspring, without affecting PF (p = 0.000032). Indeed, nicotine SA in Nic + EtOH offspring receiving AP5 was not different from PF offspring. Both VTA mRNA transcripts and NMDA receptor subunit proteins were not altered in Nic + EtOH offspring. In summary, adolescent offspring exposed to gestational Nic + EtOH show markedly increased vulnerability to become dependent on nicotine. This reflects the enhanced function of a subpopulation of VTA NMDA receptors that confer greater nicotine-induced DA release in NAcc. We hypothesized that concurrent gestational exposure to nicotine and ethanol would disrupt the control of VTA dopaminergic circuitry by NMDA receptors. Resulting in the augmented nicotine self-administration (SA) in adolescent offspring.

Title:Force-velocity, impulse-momentum relationships: implications for efficacy of purposefully slow resistance training.
Authors:['Schilling BK', 'Falvo MJ', 'Chiu LZ']
Affiliation:Exercise Neuromechanics Laboratory, The University of Memphis , Memphis, USA.
Abstract:The purpose of this brief review is to explain the mechanical relationship between impulse and momentum when resistance exercise is performed in a purposefully slow manner (PS). PS is recognized by ~10s concentric and ~4-10s eccentric actions. While several papers have reviewed the effects of PS, none has yet explained such resistance training in the context of the impulse-momentum relationship. A case study of normal versus PS back squats was also performed. An 85kg man performed both normal speed (3 sec eccentric action and maximal acceleration concentric action) and PS back squats over a several loads. Normal speed back squats produced both greater peak and mean propulsive forces than PS action when measured across all loads. However, TUT was greatly increased in the PS condition, with values fourfold greater than maximal acceleration repetitions. The data and explanation herein point to superior forces produced by the neuromuscular system via traditional speed training indicating a superior modality for inducing neuromuscular adaptation. Key pointsAs velocity approaches zero, propulsive force approaches zero, therefore slow moving objects only require force approximately equal to the weight of the resistance.As mass is constant during resistance training, a greater impulse will result in a greater velocity.The inferior propulsive forces accompanying purposefully slow training suggest other methods of resistance training have a greater potential for adaptation.

Affiliation:Exercise Neuromechanics Laboratory, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee.
Abstract:The dorsal muscles of the lower torso and extremities have often been denoted the "posterior chain." These muscles are used to support the thoracic and lumbar spine and peripheral joints, including the hip, knee, and ankle on the dorsal aspect of the body. This study investigated the relative muscle activity of the hamstring group and selected surrounding musculature during the leg curl, good morning, glute-ham raise, and Romanian deadlift (RDL). Twelve healthy, weight-trained men performed duplicate trials of single repetitions at 85% 1-repetition maximum for each lift in random order, during which surface electromyography and joint angle data were obtained. Repeated measures analysis of variance across the 4 exercises was performed to compare the activity from the erector spinae (ES), gluteus medius (GMed), semitendinosus (ST), biceps femoris (BF), and medial gastrocnemius (MGas). Significant differences (p </= 0.05) were noted in eccentric muscle activity between exercise for the MGas (p < 0.027), ST (p < 0.001), BF (p < 0.001), and ES (p = 0.032), and in concentric muscle activity, for the ES (p < 0.001), BF (p = 0.010), ST (p = 0.009), MGas (p < 0.001), and the GMed (p = 0.018). Bonferroni post hoc analysis revealed significant pairwise differences during eccentric actions for the BF, ST, and MGas. Post hoc analysis also revealed significant pairwise differences during concentric actions for the ES, BF, ST, MGas, and GMed. Each of these showed effect sizes that are large or greater. The main findings of this investigation are that the ST is substantially more active than the BF among all exercises, and hamstring activity was maximized in the RDL and glute-ham raise. Therefore, athletes and coaches who seek to maximize the involvement of the hamstring musculature should consider focusing on the glute-ham raise and RDL.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Assembly of the ribosome from its protein and RNA constituents must occur quickly and efficiently in order to synthesize the proteins necessary for all cellular activity. Since the early 1960's, certain characteristics of possible assembly pathways have been elucidated, yet the mechanisms that govern the precise recognition events remain unclear.We utilize a comparative analysis to investigate the amino acid composition of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) with respect to their role in the assembly process. We compared small subunit (30S) r-protein sequences to those of other housekeeping proteins from 560 bacterial species and searched for correlations between r-protein amino acid content and factors such as assembly binding order, environmental growth temperature, protein size, and contact with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the 30S complex. RESULTS: We find r-proteins have a significantly high percent of positive residues, which are highly represented at rRNA contact sites. An inverse correlation between the percent of positive residues and r-protein size was identified and is mainly due to the content of Lysine residues, rather than Arginine. Nearly all r-proteins carry a net positive charge, but no statistical correlation between the net charge and the binding order was detected. Thermophilic (high-temperature) r-proteins contain increased Arginine, Isoleucine, and Tyrosine, and decreased Serine and Threonine compared to mesophilic (lower-temperature), reflecting a known distinction between thermophiles and mesophiles, possibly to account for protein thermostability. However, this difference in amino acid content does not extend to rRNA contact sites, as the proportions of thermophilic and mesophilic contact residues are not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Given the significantly higher level of positively charged residues in r-proteins and at contact sites, we conclude that ribosome assembly relies heavily on an electrostatic component of interaction. However, the binding order of r-proteins in assembly does not appear to depend on these electrostatics interactions. Additionally, because thermophiles and mesophiles exhibit significantly different amino acid compositions in their sequences but not in the identities of contact sites, we conclude that this electrostatic component of interaction is insensitive to temperature and is not the determining factor differentiating the temperature sensitivity of ribosome assembly.

Abstract:STUDY OBJECTIVE: We explore what emergency physicians with access to health information exchange have to say about it and strive to better understand the factors affecting their use of it. METHODS: A qualitative study using grounded theory principles was conducted in 4 urban emergency departments that had health information exchange access for 4 years. Data were collected with unstructured interviews from 15 emergency physicians. RESULTS: Emergency physicians reported that a number of factors affected their use of health information exchange, but the most prevalent was that it was not user friendly and disrupted workflow. Five major themes emerged: variations in using health information exchange and its access, influencing clinical decisions, balancing challenges and barriers, recognizing benefits and success factors, and justifying not using health information exchange. The themes supported a theoretical interpretation that the process of using health information exchange is more complex than balancing challenges or barriers against benefits, but also how they justify not using it when making clinical decisions. We found that health information exchange systems need to be transformed to meet the needs of emergency physicians and incorporated into their workflow if it is going to be successful. The emergency physicians also identified needed improvements that would increase the frequency of health information exchange use. CONCLUSION: The emergency physicians reported that health information exchange disrupted their workflow and was less than desirable to use. The health information exchange systems need to adapt to the needs of the end user to be both useful and useable for emergency physicians.

Title:Female meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, respond differently to the scent marks of multiple male conspecifics.
Authors:['Ferkin MH', 'Hobbs NJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biological Sciences, University of Memphis, Ellington Hall, Memphis, TN, 38152, USA, mhferkin@memphis.edu.
Abstract:Many nonhuman animals are capable of discriminating a group or entity containing more objects from one containing less of the same objects. The capacity for making judgments of numerousness may also allow individuals to discriminate between potential mates. Female meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) may use judgments of relative numerousness to distinguish between potential suitors by selecting males that signal their interest by depositing more scent marks relative to other males. We used a familiarization-discrimination paradigm in the absence of training to test the hypothesis that female voles will discriminate between the different numerosities of scent marks of two male conspecifics that are similar in features of their phenotype and quality. During the exposure phase, we presented female voles with different ratios of feces scent marks from two males. During the test phase, we presented females with a single, fresh fecal scent mark from each of the two male donors, whose marks they had previously encountered during the exposure phase. In both phases, females spent more time investigating the scent mark(s) of the male that deposited more scent marks than that of the male that deposited fewer scent marks provided the difference in the ratio of scent marks provided by the male donors in the exposure phase was >/=2. Our results are consistent with studies on a variety of taxa, suggesting that numerosity discriminations are evolutionarily ancient and spontaneously available to nonhuman animals and humans.

Title:Theoretical studies of cyclic adenosine monophosphate dependent protein kinase: native enzyme and ground-state and transition-state analogues.
Authors:['Leigh KN', 'Webster CE']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, The University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. cewebstr@memphis.edu.
Abstract:The mechanisms of phosphoryl transfer enzymes have garnered considerable attention. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) catalyzes the transfer of the gamma phosphoryl group of ATP to the serine hydroxyl group of a peptide chain. Metal-containing fluoro species have been used as transition-state and ground-state analogues in a variety of phosphoryl transfer enzymes and have shed light on the nature of the requirements in the active site to catalyze phosphoryl transfer. For cAPK, we present computational studies of the mechanism of phosphoryl transfer and the structure and (19)F NMR spectra of various ground- (BeF3(-)) and transition-state (MgF3(-), AlF4(-), and AlF3(0)) analogues. With native substrate, the phosphoryl transfer proceeds through a five-coordinate phosphorane transition state, i.e., there is not a five-coordinate phosphorane intermediate. Comparisons of simulated and experimental (19)F NMR spectra show cAPK prefers a monoanionic analogue (MgF3(-) or AlF4(-)) over a neutral analogue (AlF3), supporting the charge balance hypothesis.

Title:Non-immune binding of human IgG to M-related proteins confers resistance to phagocytosis of group A streptococci in blood.
Authors:['Courtney HS', 'Li Y']
Affiliation:Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America.
Abstract:The non-immune binding of immunoglobulins by bacteria is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of infections. M-related proteins (Mrp) are group A streptococcal (GAS) receptors for immunoglobulins, but it is not known if this binding has any impact on virulence. To further investigate the binding of immunoglobulins to Mrp, we engineered mutants of an M type 4 strain of GAS by inactivating the genes for mrp, emm, enn, sof, and sfbX and tested these mutants in IgG-binding assays. Inactivation of mrp dramatically decreased the binding of human IgG, whereas inactivation of emm, enn, sof, and sfbx had only minor effects, indicating that Mrp is a major IgG-binding protein. Binding of human immunoglobulins to a purified, recombinant form of Mrp indicated that it selectively binds to the Fc domain of human IgG, but not IgA or IgM and that it preferentially bound subclasses IgG(1)>IgG(4)>IgG(2)>IgG(3). Recombinant proteins encompassing different regions of Mrp were engineered and used to map its IgG-binding domain to its A-repeat region and a recombinant protein with 3 A-repeats was a better inhibitor of IgG binding than one with a single A-repeat. A GAS mutant expressing Mrp with an in-frame deletion of DNA encoding the A-repeats had a dramatically reduced ability to bind human IgG and to grow in human blood. Mrp exhibited host specificity in binding IgG; human IgG was the best inhibitor of the binding of IgG followed by pig, horse, monkey, and rabbit IgG. IgG from goat, mouse, rat, cow, donkey, chicken, and guinea pig were poor inhibitors of binding. These findings indicate that Mrp preferentially binds human IgG and that this binding contributes to the ability of GAS to resist phagocytosis and may be a factor in the restriction of GAS infections to the human host.

Title:Electrospray mass spectrometry for the analysis of opioid peptides and for the quantification of endogenous methionine enkephalin and beta-endorphin.

Abstract:Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used to characterize several different neuropeptides, whose molecular weights ranged from 555 to 3463 Da, and to quantify endogenous methionine enkephalin (ME) and beta -endorphin (beta E) extracted from a human pituitary gland. Methionine enkephalin and leucine enkephalin both yield only an [M + H] + ion with electrospray mass spectrometry; the other peptides produce a series of multiply charged even-electron molecular ions of the general nature [M + nH](n)+ in proportion to the number of basic amino acid units present, with no evidence of fragmentation. The electrospray mass spectra are characterized by low background noise. The quantiftcation of ME is based on a comliarison of the ion current due to the [M + H] + ion of native and of a deuterated ME ([(2)H5 s-(4)Phe]-ME) internal standard. The calibration curve is linear in the range of ca. 1-35 pmol synthetic ME. The amounts of ME determined in three separate human pituitary extracts were 9.1, 8.2, and 4.7 pmol/mg protein. The corresponding amount of ME in a canine pituitary was 39.8 pmol/mg protein. To quantify beta E, the ion current due to the [M + 5H](5) + ion was monitored and compared to an external calibration curve obtained by analyzing solutions of synthetic beta E in the range 5 mumol-50 pmol. The analysis of a human pituitary yielded 660 fmol beta E/mg protein.

Title:A simple ball milling method for the preparation of p-CuO/n-ZnO nanocomposite photocatalysts with high photocatalytic activity.
Authors:['Sapkota BB', 'Mishra SR']
Affiliation:Department of Physics, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The p-n junction photocatalyst, p-CuO/n-ZnO, was prepared via ball milling of ZnO and CuO nanoparticles in water. The structural, optical, and surface properties of the p-n junction photocatalyst p-CuO/n-ZnO were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and Zeta potential analyzer. The Photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst was evaluated via photocatalytic oxidation of Methylene Blue (MB) in the presence of UV light. This study demonstrates a novel p-n junction oxide photocatalyst p-CuO (wt. 10%)/n-ZnO having superior photocatalytic activity (PCA) for the degradation of model dye under the illumination of UV-Vis light. The MB solution was only PCA, degraded by 100% within 15 min by the use of CuO (wt. 10%)/ZnO photocatalyst. Effectivley 365% increase in degradation rate constant was noticed for CuO (10 Wt.%)/ZnO nanocomposite as compared to that of pure ZnO nanoparticles. The enhanced PCA is anticipated from the presence of many micro p-n junctions formed between ZnO-CuO nanoparticles upon ball milling, which helps in efficient electron/hole pair charge separation upon excitation. The study highlights the fact that PCA of p-n junction CuO/ZnO photocatalyst can be effectively tuned by manipulating the interface of the heterostructure and by adjusting the parameters affecting the PCA. The result obtained from PCA is further verified by the zeta potential study.

Abstract:Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis) are among a small number of eusocial mammals. Eusociality is a social system where only a few individuals within a colony engage in direct reproduction, while remaining subordinate members are non-breeders and support reproductive efforts of breeding individuals. Inbreeding avoidance precludes mating between subordinate siblings and between offspring and parents. Interestingly, non-breeders readily attempt to mate with unrelated opposite-sex individuals. This is unusual since the non-breeding females do not attain puberty while in their natal colony. Based on this finding, the present study investigated the role of the gonads in the regulation of mating behaviors in this species and identified the mechanism of inbreeding avoidance. Gonadal-intact and gonadectomized non-breeders from different colonies were removed from their colonies and tested for the expression of sexual behavior. Results indicated that gonadal status had only minor effects on the expression of sexual behavior in either males or females. In a second experiment, sexual behaviors were absent between opposite-sex siblings so long as they had frequent contact with each other; however, following 5 weeks of separation, sexual behavior between these siblings was robustly expressed. Thus, Damaraland mole-rats avoid establishing mating relationships with familiar individuals but will readily mate with unfamiliar individuals of the opposite sex, with genetic relatedness apparently playing little role. The initiation of sexual behavior in Damaraland mole-rats does not require the presence of the gonads, but does require that the members of the pair have not been in contact with one another for at least several weeks.

Title:Fast atom bombardment combined with mass spectrometry for characterization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
Authors:['Dass C']
Affiliation:Charles B. Stout Neuroscience Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Department of Neurology, University of Tennessee-Memphis, 38163, Memphis, TN.
Abstract:A new approach using fast atom bombardment combined with mass spectrometry to characterize polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the range of 128-252 u molecular weight is described. Sulfolane was employed as a liquid matrix for these pi-conjugated hydrocarbons. Bombardment of sulfolane solution of certain PAHs with an atom beam produces both radical cation (M(+.)) and protonated molecule [(M + H)(+)], with no evidence of fragmentation. Collisional activation of the fast atom bombardment-desorbed M(+.) ions, however, results in several structure-specific fragment ions. Structural differences in a few isomeric hydrocarbons can be detected using the [(M + H)(+)]/[M(+.)] abundance ratio and in the pyrene-fluoranthene pair by the B/E linked-field-collision-activated dissociation data. The [(M + H)(+)]/[M(+.)] was found to be compound-specific and correlated well with certain properties (resonance energy, proton affinity, and ionizing energy) of PAHs.

Title:Synergistic combination of novel tubulin inhibitor ABI-274 and vemurafenib overcome vemurafenib acquired resistance in BRAFV600E melanoma.

Abstract:Acquired clinical resistance to vemurafenib, a selective BRAF(V600E) inhibitor, arises frequently after short-term chemotherapy. Because inhibitions of targets in the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway result in G(0)-G(1) cell-cycle arrest, vemurafenib-resistant cancer cells are expected to escape this cell-cycle arrest and progress to the subsequent G(2)-M phase. We hypothesized that a combined therapy using vemurafenib with a G(2)-M phase blocking agent will trap resistant cells and overcome vemurafenib resistance. To test this hypothesis, we first determined the combination index (CI) values of our novel tubulin inhibitor ABI-274 and vemurafenib on parental human A375 and MDA-MB-435 melanoma cell lines to be 0.32 and 0.1, respectively, suggesting strong synergy for the combination. We then developed an A375RF21 subline with significant acquired resistance to vemurafenib and confirmed the strong synergistic effect. Next, we studied the potential mechanisms of overcoming vemurafenib resistance. Flow cytometry confirmed that the combination of ABI-274 and vemurafenib synergistically arrested cells in the G(1)-G(2)-M phase, and significantly increased apoptosis in both parental A375 and the vemurafenib-resistant A375RF21 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that the combination treatment effectively reduced the level of phosphorylated and total AKT, activated the apoptosis cascade, and increased cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, but had no significant influence on the level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Finally, in vivo coadministration of vemurafenib with ABI-274 showed strong synergistic efficacy in the vemurafenib-resistant xenograft model in nude mice. Overall, these results offer a rational combination strategy to significantly enhance the therapeutic benefit in patients with melanoma who inevitably become resistant to current vemurafenib therapy.

Affiliation:College of Education, Department of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, Memphis State University, 38152, Memphis, Tennessee.
Abstract:The study examines children's stage of cognitive development in relation to their patterns of health decision-making, including their cognitive capabilities in integrating the sequential stages of the decision-making process. A sample of 81 male (N=33) and female (N=48) students were drawn from two urban public schools in West Tennessee. All participants in the study were of African-American descent. The Centers for Disease Control Decision-Making Instrument was used to assess students' decision-making as well as their understanding of the decision-making process. The children's cognitive level was determined by their performance on three Piagetian conservation tasks. Findings revealed that both the preoperational and concrete operational children performed significantly below the formal operational children in terms of total correct responses to the decision-making scenarios. Error type analyses indicated that the preoperational children made more errors involving "skipped step" than did either the concrete or formal operational children. There were no significant differences between children's level of cognitive development and any other error type. Implications for health promotion and disease prevention programs among prevention practitioners who work regularly with children are discussed.

Title:The interactive effects of chytrid fungus, pesticides, and exposure timing on gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) larvae.
Authors:['Hanlon SM', 'Parris MJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biological Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:Aquatic organisms are often exposed to a wide variety of perturbations in nature, including pathogens and chemical contaminants. Despite the co-occurrence of these 2 stressors, few studies have examined the effects of chemical contaminants on host-pathogen dynamics. The authors tested the individual and combined effects on gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) tadpoles of 2 commonly used pesticides (Roundup(R) and Sevin(R)) and the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). A fully factorial design was used, and tadpoles were exposed to Bd, Roundup, or Sevin alone, or a combination of Bd and either pesticide at 3 points during larval development (early, mid, late). It was predicted that pesticides would mediate the effect of Bd on tadpoles and reduce the likelihood of negative consequences of infection and that timing of exposure would influence these effects. Tadpoles exposed to Bd at the mid point experienced higher survival through metamorphosis than those exposed to Bd at the early or late points, while tadpoles exposed to Sevin at the early point experienced reduced survival compared with those exposed to Roundup or no-pesticide control at the same exposure point. Roundup ameliorated the effects of Bd on survival compared with tadpoles exposed to Bd alone, while there was no interactive effect of Sevin on survival. In addition, Sevin reduced mass of new metamorphs compared with Roundup and reduced snout-vent length compared with all other treatments. The present study supports the hypothesis that pesticides can mitigate the effects of Bd on amphibian hosts and that such effects may depend on the timing of exposure.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES: Given the growing support for establishing a just patient safety culture in health-care settings, a valid tool is needed to assess and improve just patient safety culture. The purpose of this study was to develop a measure of individual perceptions of just culture for a hospital setting. METHODS: The 27-item survey was administered to 998 members of a health-care staff in a pediatric research hospital as part of the hospital's ongoing patient safety culture assessment process. Subscales included balancing a blame-free approach with accountability, feedback and communication, openness of communication, quality of the event reporting process, continuous improvement, and trust. The final sample of 404 participants (40% response rate) included nurses, physicians, pharmacists, and other hospital staff members involved in patient care. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the internal structure of the measure and reliability analyses were conducted on the subscales. RESULTS: Moderate support for the factor structure was established with confirmatory factor analysis. After modifications were made to improve statistical fit, the final version of the measure included 6 subscales loading onto one higher-order dimension. Additionally, Cronbach alpha reliability scores for the subscales were positive, with each dimension being above 0.7 with the exception of one. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument designed and tested in this study demonstrated adequate structure and reliability. Given the uniqueness of the current sample, further verification of the JCAT is needed from hospitals that serve broader populations. A validated tool could also be used to evaluate the relation between just culture and patient safety outcomes.

Title:Number of lymph nodes associated with maximal reduction of long-term mortality risk in pathologic node-negative non-small cell lung cancer.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Forty-four percent of patients with pathologic node negative (pN0) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) die within 5 years of curative-intent surgical procedures. Heterogeneity in pathologic nodal examination practice raises concerns about the accuracy of nodal staging in these patients. We hypothesized a reciprocal relationship between the number of lymph nodes examined and the probability of missed lymph node metastasis and sought to identify the number of lymph nodes associated with the lowest mortality risk in pN0 NSCLC. METHODS: We analyzed resections for first primary pN0 NSCLC in the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1998 to 2009, with survival updated to December 31, 2009. RESULTS: In 24,650 eligible patients, there was a significant sequential reduction in mortality risk with examination of more lymph nodes. The lowest mortality risk occurred in those with 18 to 21 lymph nodes examined. The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.65 and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 0.57 to 0.73; for lung cancer-specific mortality, hazard ratio was 0.62 and CI was 0.53 to 0.73 (p<0.001 for both). The median number of lymph nodes examined was only 6. CONCLUSIONS: Lymph node evaluation falls far short of optimal in patients with resected pN0 NSCLC, raising the odds of underestimation of long-term mortality risk and failure to identify candidates for postoperative adjuvant therapy. This represents a major quality gap for which corrective intervention is warranted.

Abstract:The aim of this paper is to develop a spatial Gaussian predictive process (SGPP) framework for accurately predicting neuroimaging data by using a set of covariates of interest, such as age and diagnostic status, and an existing neuroimaging data set. To achieve a better prediction, we not only delineate spatial association between neuroimaging data and covariates, but also explicitly model spatial dependence in neuroimaging data. The SGPP model uses a functional principal component model to capture medium-to-long-range (or global) spatial dependence, while SGPP uses a multivariate simultaneous autoregressive model to capture short-range (or local) spatial dependence as well as cross-correlations of different imaging modalities. We propose a three-stage estimation procedure to simultaneously estimate varying regression coefficients across voxels and the global and local spatial dependence structures. Furthermore, we develop a predictive method to use the spatial correlations as well as the cross-correlations by employing a cokriging technique, which can be useful for the imputation of missing imaging data. Simulation studies and real data analysis are used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of SGPP and show that SGPP significantly outperforms several competing methods, such as voxel-wise linear model, in prediction. Although we focus on the morphometric variation of lateral ventricle surfaces in a clinical study of neurodevelopment, it is expected that SGPP is applicable to other imaging modalities and features.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: Pediatric psychologists are often interested in finding patterns in heterogeneous cross-sectional data. Latent variable mixture modeling is an emerging person-centered statistical approach that models heterogeneity by classifying individuals into unobserved groupings (latent classes) with similar (more homogenous) patterns. The purpose of this article is to offer a nontechnical introduction to cross-sectional mixture modeling. METHOD: An overview of latent variable mixture modeling is provided and 2 cross-sectional examples are reviewed and distinguished. RESULTS: Step-by-step pediatric psychology examples of latent class and latent profile analyses are provided using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 data file. CONCLUSIONS: Latent variable mixture modeling is a technique that is useful to pediatric psychologists who wish to find groupings of individuals who share similar data patterns to determine the extent to which these patterns may relate to variables of interest.

Abstract:Coordination of cell metabolism and immune signals is crucial for lymphocyte priming. Emerging evidence also highlights the importance of cell metabolism for the activation of innate immunity upon pathogen challenge, but there is little evidence of how this process contributes to immune cell development. Here we show that differentiation of dendritic cells (DCs) from bone marrow precursors is associated with dynamic regulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and cell metabolism. Unexpectedly, enhancing mTORC1 activity via ablation of its negative regulator tuberous sclerosis 1 (Tsc1) impaired DC development in vivo and in vitro, associated with defective cell survival and proliferation. Moreover, Tsc1 deficiency caused DC spontaneous maturation but a propensity to differentiate into other lineages, and attenuated DC-mediated effector TH1 responses. Mechanistically, Tsc1-deficient DCs exhibited increased glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and lipid synthesis that were partly mediated by the transcription factor Myc, highlighting a key role of Tsc1 in modulating metabolic programming of DC differentiation. Further, Tsc1 signaled through Rheb to down-regulate mTORC1 for proper DC development, whereas its effect at modulating mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) activity was largely dispensable. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between Tsc1-Rheb-mTORC1 signaling and Myc-dependent bioenergetic and biosynthetic activities constitutes a key metabolic checkpoint to orchestrate DC development.

Abstract:Over the last two decades West Nile Virus (WNV) has been responsible for significant disease outbreaks in humans and animals in many parts of the World. Its extremely rapid global diffusion argues for a better understanding of its geographic extent. The purpose of this inquiry was to explore spatio-temporal patterns of WNV using geospatial technologies to study populations of the reservoir hosts, vectors, and human hosts, in addition to the spatio-temporal interactions among these populations. Review of the recent literature on spatial WNV disease risk modeling led to the conclusion that numerous environmental factors might be critical for its dissemination. New Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based studies are monitoring occurrence at the macro-level, and helping pinpoint areas of occurrence at the micro-level, where geographically-targeted, species-specific control measures are sometimes taken and more sophisticated methods of surveillance have been used.

Title:Hyperoxia increases the elastic modulus of alveolar epithelial cells through Rho kinase.

Abstract:Patients with acute lung injury are administered high concentrations of oxygen during mechanical ventilation, and while both hyperoxia and mechanical ventilation are necessary, each can independently cause additional injury. However, the precise mechanisms that lead to injury are not well understood. We hypothesized that alveolar epithelial cells may be more susceptible to injury caused by mechanical ventilation because hyperoxia causes cells to be stiffer due to increased filamentous actin (f-actin) formation via the GTPase RhoA and its effecter Rho kinase (ROCK). We examined cytoskeletal structures in cultured murine lung alveolar epithelial cells (MLE-12) under normoxic and hyperoxic (48 h) conditions. We also measured cell elasticity (E) using an atomic force microscope in the indenter mode. Hyperoxia caused increased f-actin stress fibers and bundle formation, an increase in g- and f-actin, an increase in nuclear area and a decrease in nuclear height, and cells became stiffer (higher E). Treatment with an inhibitor (Y-27632) of ROCK significantly decreased E and prevented the cytoskeletal changes, while it did not influence the nuclear height and area. Pre-exposure of cells to hyperoxia promoted detachment when cells were subsequently stretched cyclically, but the ROCK inhibitor prevented this effect. Hyperoxia caused thickening of vinculin focal adhesion plaques, and inhibition of ROCK reduced the formation of distinct focal adhesion plaques. Phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase was significantly reduced by both hyperoxia and treatment with Y-27632. Hyperoxia caused increased cell stiffness and promoted cell detachment during stretch. These effects were ameliorated by inhibition of ROCK.

Title:Propensity for social interaction predicts nicotine-reinforced behaviors in outbred rats.

Abstract:Social and genetic factors can influence smoking behavior. Using olfactogustatory stimuli as the sensory cue for intravenous nicotine self-administration (SA), we previously showed that social learning of nicotine contingent odor cue prevented rats from developing conditioned taste aversion and allowed them to instead establish stable nicotine SA. We hypothesized that genetic factors influenced socially acquired nicotine SA. A heterogeneous stock (HS; N/NIH) of outbred rats was trained to self-administer nicotine using the social learning protocol. Both male and female HS rats acquired nicotine SA, but females self-administered more nicotine than males. After extinction, the context previously paired with nicotine SA, in conjunction with socially transmitted drug cues, was sufficient to cause reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. Wide variation in both nicotine intake and reinstatement was observed. Using multiple regression analysis, we found that measures of social interaction were significant predictors of nicotine intake and reinstatement of drug seeking in both males and females. Furthermore, measures of depression were predictors of nicotine intake in both males and females, anxiety was a predictor only in males and response to novelty was a predictor only in females. In males, measures of both depression and anxiety predicted nicotine reinstatement. Together, these data supported the ideas that genetically determined propensities for emotional and social phenotypes are significant determinants for nicotine-reinforced behavior, and that the HS rat is a suitable tool for dissecting genetic mechanisms that may underlie the interaction between social behavior, anxiety, depression and smoking.

Abstract:This study examined the effects of bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the nucleus accumbens core (NAc-co), dorsomedial striatum (DMS) or dorsolateral striatum (DLS) of rats on the learning and extinction of Pavlovian and instrumental components of conditioned avoidance responses (CARs). None of the lesions caused sensorimotor deficits that could affect locomotion. Lesions of the NAc-co, but not DMS or DLS, decreased unconditioned and conditioned freezing. The NAc-co and DLS lesioned rats learned the 2-way active avoidance task more slowly. These results suggest: (i) CARs depend on both Pavlovian and instrumental learning; (ii) learning the Pavlovian component of CARs depends on the NAc-co; learning the instrumental component of CARs depends on the DLS, NAc and DMS; (iii) although the NAc-co is also needed for learning the instrumental component, it is not clear whether it plays a role in learning the instrumental component per se or if it simply allows learning of the Pavlovian component which is a pre-condition for learning the instrumental component; (iv) we did not find evidence that the DMS and DLS play the same roles in habit and goal-directed aspects of the instrumental component of CARs as observed in appetitive motivated instrumental responding.

Abstract:Neural abnormalities commonly associated with autism spectrum disorders include prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction and cerebellar pathology in the form of Purkinje cell loss and cerebellar hypoplasia. It has been reported that loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells results in aberrant dopamine neurotransmission in the PFC which occurs via dysregulation of multisynaptic efferents from the cerebellum to the PFC. Using a mouse model, we investigated the possibility that developmental cerebellar Purkinje cell loss could disrupt glutamatergic cerebellar projections to the PFC that ultimately modulate DA release. We measured glutamate release evoked by local electrical stimulation using fixed-potential amperometry in combination with glutamate selective enzyme-based recording probes in urethane-anesthetized Lurcher mutant and wildtype mice. Target sites included the mediodorsal and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei, reticulotegmental nuclei, pedunculopontine nuclei, and ventral tegmental area. With the exception of the ventral tegmental area, the results indicated that in comparison to wildtype mice, evoked glutamate release was reduced in Lurcher mutants by between 9 and 72% at all stimulated sites. These results are consistent with the notion that developmental loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells drives reductions in evoked glutamate release in cerebellar efferent pathways that ultimately influence PFC dopamine release. Possible mechanisms whereby reductions in glutamate release could occur are discussed.

Title:Modeling long-term host cell-Giardia lamblia interactions in an in vitro co-culture system.
Authors:['Fisher BS', 'Estrano CE', 'Cole JA']
Affiliation:Department of Biological Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America.
Abstract:Globally, there are greater than 700,000 deaths per year associated with diarrheal disease. The flagellated intestinal parasite, Giardia lamblia, is one of the most common intestinal pathogens in both humans and animals throughout the world. While attached to the gastrointestinal epithelium, Giardia induces epithelial cell apoptosis, disrupts tight junctions, and increases intestinal permeability. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of giardiasis, including the role lamina propria immune cells, such as macrophages, play in parasite control or clearance are poorly understood. Thus far, one of the major obstacles in ascertaining the mechanisms of Giardia pathology is the lack of a functionally relevant model for the long-term study of the parasite in vitro. Here we report on the development of an in vitro co-culture model which maintains the basolateral-apical architecture of the small intestine and allows for long-term survival of the parasite. Using transwell inserts, Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells and IC-21 macrophages are co-cultured in the presence of Giardia trophozoites. Using the developed model, we show that Giardia trophozoites survive over 21 days and proliferate in a combination media of Caco-2 cell and Giardia medium. Giardia induces apoptosis of epithelial cells through caspase-3 activation and macrophages do not abrogate this response. Additionally, macrophages induce Caco-2 cells to secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokines, GRO and IL-8, a response abolished by Giardia indicating parasite induced suppression of the host immune response. The co-culture model provides additional complexity and information when compared to a single-cell model. This model will be a valuable tool for answering long-standing questions on host-parasite biology that may lead to discovery of new therapeutic interventions.

Abstract:Chitosan, a natural polysaccharide, has demonstrated potential as a degradable biocompatible guided bone regeneration membrane. This study aimed to evaluate the in vivo biocompatibility and degradation of chitosan nanofiber membranes, with and without genipin crosslinking as compared with a commercial collagen membrane in rat model. Chitosan nanofiber membranes, with and without genipin crosslinking, and collagen membrane (control) were implanted subcutaneously in the backs of 30 rats. The membranes were analyzed histologically at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks. Sections were viewed and graded by a blinded pathologist using a 4-point scoring system (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) to determine the tissue reaction to the membranes and to observe membrane degradation. There was no statistically significant difference in histological scores among chitosan and collagen membranes at different time points. Absence or minimal inflammation was observed in 57-74% of the membranes across all groups. Most chitosan membranes persisted for 16-20 weeks, whereas most collagen membranes disappeared by resorption at 12-16 weeks. The general tissue response to chitosan nanofiber membranes with and without genipin crosslinking, was similar to that of control commercial collagen membrane. However, the chitosan membranes exhibited slower degradation rates than collagen membranes.

Abstract:Data suggest anxious drivers may engage in problematic behaviors that place themselves and others at increased risk of negative traffic events. Three domains of problematic behavior--exaggerated safety/caution, performance deficits, and hostile/aggressive behaviors--previously were identified during development of the Driving Behavior Survey (DBS), a novel measure of anxiety-related behavior. Extending this research, the current study examined the psychometric properties of DBS scores among individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) subsequent to motor vehicle trauma (N=40). Internal consistencies and 12-week test-retest reliabilities for DBS scales ranged from good to excellent. Comparison of scores to normative student data indicated dose-response relationships for safety/caution and performance deficit subscales, with increased frequency of anxious behavior occurring within the PTSD sample. Associations with standard clinical measures provide additional evidence for anxiety-related driving behavior as a unique marker of functional impairment, distinct from both avoidance and disorder-specific symptoms.

Abstract:Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft-tissue sarcoma with molecular and cellular features of developing skeletal muscle. Rhabdomyosarcoma has two major histologic subtypes, embryonal and alveolar, each with distinct clinical, molecular, and genetic features. Genomic analysis shows that embryonal tumors have more structural and copy number variations than alveolar tumors. Mutations in the RAS/NF1 pathway are significantly associated with intermediate- and high-risk embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (ERMS). In contrast, alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas (ARMS) have fewer genetic lesions overall and no known recurrently mutated cancer consensus genes. To identify therapeutics for ERMS, we developed and characterized orthotopic xenografts of tumors that were sequenced in our study. High-throughput screening of primary cultures derived from those xenografts identified oxidative stress as a pathway of therapeutic relevance for ERMS.

Title:Efferent-mediated reduction in cochlear gain does not alter tuning estimates from stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emission group delays.

Abstract:The existence of efferent feedback from cortical and subcortical brain centers to the hair cells of the cochlea has been recognized for many years, but the role that efferent neurons play in hearing is not completely known. Stimulation of medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent neurons suppresses sound-evoked basilar membrane responses and changes the tuning of single auditory nerve fibers in animal models. Both of these effects are linked to a MOC-induced reduction in the gain of the cochlear amplification provided by outer hair cells. To non-invasively examine the link between cochlear suppression and tuning in humans, stimulus-frequency otoacoustic emissions (SFOAEs) were recorded in conditions with and without contralateral acoustic stimulation (CAS) from 28 normal-hearing participants. SFOAEs were measured using clusters of closely-spaced probe-tone frequencies centered near 1.4 and 2.0kHz. An index of cochlear tuning, QERB, was calculated based on measures of SFOAE group delay at both 1.4 and 2.0kHz. A statistically significant (p<0.01) decrease in SFOAE levels acquired during CAS was detected only for the SFOAE cluster centered at 2kHz. No statistically significant differences in QERB were found between conditions with and without CAS at 1.4 and 2.0kHz. These findings suggest that in humans, tuning based on SFOAE group delay estimates is not appreciably altered at cochlear locations with MOC efferent-induced reductions in cochlear gain.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: This study tested the hypothesis that data from random digit-dial telephone surveys underestimate the prevalence of cigarette smoking among African-American adults. METHOD: A novel, community-sampling method was used to obtain a statewide, random sample of N = 2118 California (CA) African-American/Black adults, surveyed door-to-door. This Black community sample was compared to the Blacks in the CA Health Interview Survey (N = 2315), a statewide, random digit-dial telephone survey conducted simultaneously. RESULTS: Smoking prevalence was significantly higher among community (33%) than among telephone survey (19%) Blacks, even after controlling for sample differences in demographics. CONCLUSION: Telephone surveys underestimate smoking among African-Americans and probably underestimate other health risk behaviors as well. Alternative methods are needed to obtain accurate data on African-American health behaviors and on the magnitude of racial disparities in them.

Title:Decisional inconsistencies in the management of contaminated, sport-caught fish.

Affiliation:University of Memphis, School of Public Health, USA. University of Memphis, School of Public Health, USA.
Abstract:Persistent toxic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls and mercury accumulate in tissues of fish that are caught and consumed by sport anglers and their families. Unlike commercially-sold fish, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not regulate sport-caught fish that are contaminated with these and other pollutants. Instead, nearly every state in the U.S. develops and issues consumption advice for contaminated sport-caught fish. We examined fish consumption advice issued by states that border and share waters of the Mississippi River. Our examination identified numerous jurisdictional inconsistencies that threaten the receptivity and credibility of consumption advice and, more important, threaten the health of individuals who consume contaminated sport-caught fish.

Title:Performance of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice on a touchscreen-based attentional set-shifting task.

Abstract:Attentional set-shifting deficits are a feature of multiple psychiatric disorders. However, the neurogenetic mechanisms underlying these deficits are largely unknown. In the present study we assessed performance of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice on a touchscreen-based attentional set-shifting task similar to those used with humans and non-human primates. In experiment 1, mice discriminated simple white lines followed by compound stimuli composed of white lines superimposed on grey shapes. Although performance of the two strains was largely equivalent during early stages of the task, DBA/2J mice committed significantly more errors compared to C57BL/6J mice on the extra-dimensional shift. Additionally, performance of mice as a group declined across the three compound discrimination reversals. In experiment 2 we assessed salience of the shapes and lines dimensions and determined if dimensional salience, a variable previously shown to affect set-shifting abilities in humans and non-human primates, could be systematically manipulated. Findings from experiment 2 suggested that strain differences during the extra-dimensional shift in experiment 1 were most parsimoniously explained by a consistently impaired ability in DBA/2J mice to discriminate a subset of the compound stimuli. Additionally, unlike maze-based tasks, the relative salience of the two dimensions could be manipulated by systematically altering the width of lines exemplars while retaining other potentially-relevant attributes of the compound stimuli. These findings reveal unique and in some cases strain-dependent phenomena related to discriminations of simple and multidimensional visual stimuli which may facilitate future efforts to identify and fully characterize visual discrimination, reversal learning, and attentional set-shifting deficits in mice.

Abstract:Heating powder isolated soy proteins (ISPs) in a N(2) environment produced thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL), in 2 major temperature regions, 50 to 250 degrees C (region R1) and 250 to 350 degrees C (region R2). In soy protein 7S fraction, strong TSL was detected in both regions with glow peak maximum (T(m)) at 150 +/- 15 degrees C and at 300 +/- 10 degrees C. Two additional satellite or shoulder peaks were detected from the ISP and 7S protein fraction within region R1 at T(m) = 90 degrees C and T(m) = 210 degrees C. The soy protein 11S fraction produced a broad, poorly defined TSL peak in the low-temperature region. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy data from the control ISP sample, deuterium sulfide-treated ISP, ISP stored in either N(2) or O(2), and defatted soy flour, indicated that the trapped radicals present in ISP is associated with the production of the primary TSL peak at 150 +/- 15 degrees C. Activation energies required to release the trapped charges (for luminescence to occur) are approximately 0.70, 0.78, 1.50, and 1.8 eV for TSL at Tm = 100, 150, 200, and 300 degrees C, respectively. The reaction mechanism that leads to the release of the trapped charges for TSL to occur followed a mixed order kinetic, between 1.5 and 1.8. The frequency factor varied between 10(7)/s and 10(1)(7)/s.

Abstract:We investigated the metabolism of vitamin D2 to hydroxyvitamin D2 metabolites ((OH)D2) by human placentas ex-utero, adrenal glands ex-vivo and cultured human epidermal keratinocytes and colonic Caco-2 cells, and identified 20(OH)D2, 17,20(OH)(2)D2, 1,20(OH)(2)D2, 25(OH)D2 and 1,25(OH)(2)D2 as products. Inhibition of product formation by 22R-hydroxycholesterol indicated involvement of CYP11A1 in 20- and 17-hydroxylation of vitamin D2, while use of ketoconazole indicated involvement of CYP27B1 in 1alpha-hydroxylation of products. Studies with purified human CYP11A1 confirmed the ability of this enzyme to convert vitamin D2 to 20(OH)D2 and 17,20(OH)(2)D2. In placentas and Caco-2 cells, production of 20(OH)D2 was higher than 25(OH)D2 while in human keratinocytes the production of 20(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D2 were comparable. HaCaT keratinocytes showed high accumulation of 1,20(OH)(2)D2 relative to 20(OH)D2 indicating substantial CYP27B1 activity. This is the first in vivo evidence for a novel pathway of vitamin D2 metabolism initiated by CYP11A1 and modified by CYP27B1, with the product profile showing tissue- and cell-type specificity.

Abstract:Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), in response to their growth factor ligands, phosphorylate and activate downstream signals important for physiological development and pathological transformation. Increased expression, activating mutations and rearrangement fusions of RTKs lead to cancer, inflammation, pain, neurodegenerative diseases, and other disorders. Activation or over-expression of ALK, ROS1, TRK (A, B, and C), and RET are associated with oncogenic phenotypes of their respective tissues, making them attractive therapeutic targets. Cancer cDNA array studies demonstrated over-expression of TRK-A and ROS1 in a variety of cancers, compared to their respective normal tissue controls. We synthesized a library of small molecules that inhibit the above indicated RTKs with picomolar to nanomolar potency. The lead molecule GTx-186 inhibited RTK-dependent cancer cell and tumor growth. In vitro and in vivo growth of TRK-A-dependent IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells and ROS1-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells were inhibited by GTx-186. GTx-186 also inhibited inflammatory signals mediated by NFkappaB, AP-1, and TRK-A and potently reduced atopic dermatitis and air-pouch inflammation in mice and rats. Moreover, GTx-186 effectively inhibited ALK phosphorylation and ALK-dependent cancer cell growth. Collectively, the RTK inhibitor GTx-186 has a unique kinase profile with potential to treat cancer, inflammation, and neuropathic pain.

Abstract:The purpose of this study is to investigate whether expression profiles of alcoholism-relevant genes in different parts of the brain are correlated differently with those in the liver. Four experiments were conducted. First, we used gene expression profiles from five parts of the brain (striatum, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and cerebellum) and from liver in a population of recombinant inbred mouse strains to examine the expression association of 10 alcoholism-relevant genes. Second, we conducted the same association analysis between brain structures and the lung. Third, using five randomly selected, nonalcoholism-relevant genes, we conducted the association analysis between brain and liver. Finally, we compared the expression of 10 alcoholism-relevant genes in hippocampus and cerebellum between an alcohol preference strain and a wild-type control. We observed a difference in correlation patterns in expression levels of 10 alcoholism-relevant genes between different parts of the brain with those of liver. We then examined the association of gene expression between alcohol dehydrogenases (Adh1, Adh2, Adh5, and Adh7) and different parts of the brain. The results were similar to those of the 10 genes. Then, we found that the association of those genes between brain structures and lung was different from that of liver. Next, we found that the association patterns of five alcoholism-nonrelevant genes were different from those of 10 alcoholism-relevant genes. Finally, we found that the expression level of 10 alcohol-relevant genes is influenced more in hippocampus than in cerebellum in the alcohol preference strain. Our results show that the expression of alcoholism-relevant genes in liver is differently associated with the expression of genes in different parts of the brain. Because different structural changes in different parts of the brain in alcoholism have been reported, it is important to investigate whether those structural differences in the brains of those with alcoholism are due to the difference in the associations of gene expression between genes in liver and in different parts of the brain.

Abstract:The 3D Star Coordinate Projection (3DSCP) visualisation algorithm has been developed to address the following key issues: choosing the projection configuration autonomously. preserving the data topology after projection. enhancing resolution. A supervised version of 3DSCP (S3DSCP) is also introduced to improve the computational efficiency of 3DSCP. Comparison with other linear, non-linear and axis-based techniques is performed to illustrate the efficacy of the 3DSCP and S3DSCP methods. Empirical analyses indicate that the 3DSCP and S3DSCP algorithms find hidden patterns in data while overcoming limitations of other techniques.

Abstract:The objective of our study was to identify genetic factors that regulate bone mineral density (BMD) in mice using well defined recombinant inbred strains. For this purpose we chose the BXD recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from progeny of the C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) progenitor strains. We sampled both male and female mice ( approximately 4 each) of 46 strains at 3 months-of-age, measured their BMD, and conducted QTL mapping. The data were analyzed to identify candidates genes contained within the most significant quantitative trait locus (QTL). Evaluation of candidate genes included functional assessment, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and direct sequencing. We established that there was a QTL for BMD in males on chromosome 15 that has the impact larger than QTLs on all other chromosomes. The QTL on chromosome 15 was narrowed to a genomic region between 38 Mbp and 52 Mbp. By examining transcripts within this region, we found an important candidate gene: trichorhinophalangeal syndrome, type I (Trps1). SNP analysis identified a nonsynonymous SNP (rs32398060) in Trps1 that co-segregated with bone mineral density. Analysis of association between this SNP within TRPS1 and BMD in a human population confirmed its significance.

Abstract:When investigating the potential for xanthine oxidase (XO)-mediated metabolism of a new chemical entity in vitro, selective chemical inhibition experiments are typically used. Most commonly, these inhibition experiments are performed using the inhibitor allopurinol (AP) and commercially prepared human liver cytosol (HLC) as the enzyme source. For reasons detailed herein, it is also a common practice to perfuse livers with solutions containing AP prior to liver harvest. The exposure to AP in HLC preparations could obviously pose a problem for measuring in vitro XO activity. To investigate this potential problem, an HPLC-MS/MS assay was developed to determine whether AP and its primary metabolite, oxypurinol, are retained within the cytosol for livers that were treated with AP during liver harvest. Differences in enzymatic activity for XO and aldehyde oxidase (AO) in human cytosol that can be ascribed to AP exposure were also evaluated. The results confirmed the presence of residual AP (some) and oxypurinol (all) human liver cytosol preparations that had been perfused with an AP-containing solution. In every case where oxypurinol was detected, XO activity was not observed. In contrast, the presence of AP and oxypurinol did not appear to have an impact on AO activity. Pooled HLC that was purchased from a commercial source also contained residual oxypurinol and did not show any XO activity. In the future, it is recommended that each HLC batch is screened for oxypurinol and/or XO activity prior to testing for XO-mediated metabolism of a new chemical entity.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: This study evaluated the hypotheses that sentence production by speakers with adductor (AD) and abductor (AB) spasmodic dysphonia (SD) may be differentially influenced by consonant voicing and manner features, in comparison with healthy, matched, nondysphonic controls. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, single blind study, using a between-groups, repeated measures design for the independent variables of perceived voice quality and sentence duration. METHODS: Sixteen subjects with ADSD and 10 subjects with ABSD, as well as 26 matched healthy controls produced four short, simple sentences that were systematically loaded with voiced or voiceless consonants of either obstruant or continuant manner categories. Experienced voice clinicians, who were "blind" as to speakers' group affixations, used visual analog scaling to judge the overall voice quality of each sentence. Acoustic sentence durations were also measured. RESULTS: Speakers with ABSD or ADSD demonstrated significantly poorer than normal voice quality on all sentences. Speakers with ABSD exhibited longer than normal duration for voiceless consonant sentences. Speakers with ADSD had poorer voice quality for voiced than for voiceless consonant sentences. Speakers with ABSD had longer durations for voiceless than for voiced consonant sentences. CONCLUSIONS: The two subtypes of SD exhibit differential performance on the basis of consonant voicing in short, simple sentences; however, each subgroup manifested voicing-related differences on a different variable (voice quality vs sentence duration). Findings suggest different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for ABSD and ADSD. Findings also support inclusion of short, simple sentences containing voiced or voiceless consonants as part of the diagnostic protocol for SD, with measurement of sentence duration in addition to judments of voice quality severity.

Title:Comparison of monovalent and divalent ion distributions around a DNA duplex with molecular dynamics simulation and a Poisson-Boltzmann approach.
Authors:['Robbins TJ', 'Ziebarth JD', 'Wang Y']

Abstract:The ion atmosphere created by monovalent (Na(+) ) or divalent (Mg(2+) ) cations surrounding a B-form DNA duplex were examined using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation. The ion distributions predicted by the two methods were compared using plots of radial and two-dimensional cation concentrations and by calculating the total number of cations and net solution charge surrounding the DNA. Na(+) ion distributions near the DNA were more diffuse in PB calculations than in corresponding MD simulations, with PB calculations predicting lower concentrations near DNA groove sites and phosphate groups and a higher concentration in the region between these locations. Other than this difference, the Na(+) distributions generated by the two methods largely agreed, as both predicted similar locations of high Na(+) concentration and nearly identical values of the number of cations and the net solution charge at all distances from the DNA. In contrast, there was greater disagreement between the two methods for Mg(2+) cation concentration profiles, as both the locations and magnitudes of peaks in Mg(2+) concentration were different. Despite experimental and simulation observations that Mg(2+) typically maintains its first solvation shell when interacting with nucleic acids, modeling Mg(2+) as an unsolvated ion during PB calculations improved the agreement of the Mg(2+) ion atmosphere predicted by the two methods and allowed for values of the number of bound ions and net solution charge surrounding the DNA from PB calculations that approached the values observed in MD simulations.

Title:Combined treatment with sodium butyrate and PD153035 enhances keratinocyte differentiation.

Abstract:Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) signalling is a critical determinant of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation in both normal and diseased skin. Here we explore the effects of combined treatment with the differentiation-promoting agent sodium butyrate (SB) and the EGFR inhibitor (EGFRI) PD153035 on terminal differentiation of normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). Cells treated with SB showed increased expression of the levels of mRNA and protein of the differentiation markers filaggrin and transglutaminase 1. Cotreatment with EGF significantly blunted these effects of SB. Combined treatment with SB and PD153035 alleviated these inhibitory actions of EGF, resulting in improved effects of decreased cell growth and increased terminal differentiation, relative to the individual treatments. These results indicate that the combined use of a differentiation-promoting agent and an EGFR inhibitor may offer an additional approach to the management of hyperproliferative skin diseases.

Abstract:Recent observations suggest a lower incidence of malignancies in patients infected with HIV during treatment with Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) utilizing protease inhibitors. We investigated the effects of ritonavir, a FDA approved HIV protease inhibitor, on proliferation of pancreatic ductal adeno-carcinoma (PDAC) cell lines. Human PDAC cell lines BxPC-3, MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1 were propagated under standard conditions and treated with serial dilutions of ritonavir. Ritonavir inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner as well as activated the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines. We observed down-modulation of cell-cycle promoting and up-regulation of cell-cycle inhibitory genes; enhanced interaction of retinoblastoma protein (RB) with E2F-1 transcription factor; inhibition of phosphorylation of RB, resulting in sequestration of E2F-1 and subsequent down-regulation of S phase genes; decreased interaction of E2F-1 with its consensus binding sites; inhibition of cell motility and invasiveness; and inhibition of the AKT pathway. Our results demonstrate a potential use of ritonavir as part of combination chemotherapy for PDAC. Since ritonavir is FDA approved for HIV, drug repositioning for PDAC would limit the costs and reduce risks.

Abstract:Multiple studies show that molecular genetic changes and epigenetic modifications affect the risk of cognitive disability or impairment. However, the role of epigenetic variation in cognitive development of neurotypical young children remains largely unknown. Using data from a prospective, community-based study of mother-infant pairs, we investigated the association of DNA methylation patterns in neonatal umbilical cord blood with cognitive and language development at 1 year of age. No CpG loci achieved genome-wide significance, although a small number of weakly suggestive associations with Bayley-III Receptive Communication scales were noted. While umbilical cord blood is a convenient resource for genetic analyses of birth outcomes, our results do not provide conclusive evidence that its use for DNA methylation profiling yields epigenetic markers that are directly related to postnatal neurocognitive outcomes at 1 year of age.

Abstract:We model the vague-to-crisp dynamics of forming percepts in the brain by combining two methodologies: dynamic logic (DL) and operant learning process. Forming percepts upon the presentation of visual inputs is likened to model selection based on sampled evidence. Our framework utilizes the DL in selecting the correct "percept" among competing ones, but uses an intrinsic reward mechanism to allow stochastic online update in lieu of performing the optimization step of the DL framework. We discuss the connection of our framework with cognitive processing and the intentional neurodynamic cycle.

Abstract:Classical genetic studies show the heritability of cigarette smoking is 0.4-0.6, and that multiple genes confer susceptibility and resistance to smoking. Despite recent advances in identifying genes associated with smoking behaviors, the major source of this heritability and its impact on susceptibility and resistance are largely unknown. Operant self-administration (SA) of intravenous nicotine is an established model for smoking behavior. We recently confirmed that genetic factors exert strong control over nicotine intake in isogenic rat strains. Because the processing of afferent dopaminergic signals by nucleus accumbens shell (AcbS) is critical for acquisition and maintenance of motivated behaviors reinforced by nicotine, we hypothesized that differential basal gene expression in AcbS accounts for much of the strain-to-strain variation in nicotine SA. We therefore sequenced the transcriptome of AcbS samples obtained by laser capture microdissection from 10 isogenic adolescent rat strains and compared all RNA transcript levels with behavior. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis, a systems biology method, found 12 modules (i.e., unique sets of genes that covary across all samples) that correlated (p<0.05) with amount of self-administered nicotine; 9 of 12 correlated negatively, implying a protective role. PCR confirmed selected genes from these modules. Chilibot, a literature mining tool, identified 15 genes within 1 module that were nominally associated with cigarette smoking, thereby providing strong support for the analytical approach. This is the first report demonstrating that nicotine intake by adolescent rodents is associated with the expression of specific genes in AcbS of the mesolimbic system, which controls motivated behaviors. These findings provide new insights into genetic mechanisms that predispose or protect against tobacco addiction.

Abstract:The aim of the study was to determine the antiangiogenic efficacy of vatalanib, sunitinib, and AMD3100 in an animal model of human glioblastoma (GBM) by using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and tumor protein expression analysis. Orthotopic GBM-bearing animals were randomly assigned either to control group or vatalanib, sunitinib, and AMD3100 treatment groups. Following 2 weeks of drug treatment, tumor growth and vascular parameters were measured using DCE-MRI. Expression of different angiogenic factors in tumor extracts was measured using a membrane-based human antibody array kit. Tumor angiogenesis and invasion were determined by immunohistochemistry. DCE-MRI showed a significant increase in tumor size after vatalanib treatment. AMD3100-treated group showed a significant decrease in a number of vascular parameters determined by DCE-MRI. AMD3100 significantly decreased the expression of different angiogenic factors compared to sunitinib or vatalanib; however, there were no significant changes in vascular density among the groups. Sunitinib-treated animals showed significantly higher migration of the invasive cells, whereas in both vatalanib- and AMD3100-treated animals the invasive cell migration distance was significantly lower compared to that of control. Vatalanib and sunitinib resulted in suboptimal therapeutic effect, but AMD3100 treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth, permeability, interstitial space volume, and invasion of tumor cells in an animal model of GBM.

Abstract:Relatively few scholars have made use of the Slave Narrative Collection, a collection of more than 2,300 autobiographical narratives detailing the lives of people who had been born into slavery. Housed at the Library of Congress, the Collection was gathered during the 1930s under the direction of the Federal Writers Project. Research derived from the Collection thus far has dealt primarily with the experience of slavery as a whole. The present study focuses on loss as it was experienced by former slaves. This qualitative study used a grounded theory approach to analyze 48 narratives. Results culminated in a core category or central theme that for former slaves loss was both a cause and a consequence of dehumanization. Findings also suggested that people experienced loss as a result of witnessing or experiencing violence and of living in deprivation and fear. Other losses included losses of hope and identity. Losses associated with the pain and suffering of family members were hardest to bear.

Abstract:Despite much recent theorizing, evidence regarding the temporal relationship of sense-making to adjustment following bereavement remains relatively sparse. This study examined the role of searching for and making sense of loss in late-life spousal bereavement, using prospective, longitudinal data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) project (N = 250). Searching at 6 and 18 months post-loss predicted both contemporaneous and subsequent grief. Sense-making was not related to grief for this sample. In contrast, sense-making at 6 months and 18 months predicted positive affect at 48 months, although searching had no prospective effect on this outcome. Searching at 6 months predicted depression at 18 months. Results are interpreted in terms of meaning-oriented theories of bereavement and processes promoting both adaptive and maladaptive outcomes.

Abstract:Numerous treatments are available that address the core symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, there are a number of related behavioral stress responses that are not assessed with PTSD measures, yet these behavioral stress responses affect quality of life. The goal of the current study was to investigate whether a recently developed measure of behavioral stress response, the Driving Behavior Survey (DBS), was sensitive to change associated with treatment among a group of participants diagnosed with PTSD. The DBS indexes anxious driving behavior, which is frequently observed among individuals with motor vehicle accident-related PTSD. Participants (n=40) were racially diverse adults (M age=40.78, 63% women) who met diagnostic criteria for motor vehicle accident-related PTSD. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses indicated that participants who were assigned to a brief, exposure-based intervention displayed significant reductions on the DBS subscales relative to participants assigned to the wait-list control condition (r=.41-.43). Moreover, mediational analyses indicated that the observed reductions on the DBS subscales were not better accounted for by reductions in PTSD. Taken together, these findings suggest that the DBS subscales are sensitive to changes associated with PTSD treatment and can be used to augment outcome assessment in PTSD treatment trials.

Abstract:Although the role of spiritual, psychological, and social factors is receiving increasing attention in the end of life (EOL) context, we know far less than we need to about how these factors shape attitudes toward life and death in the face of looming loss. The present study begins to remedy these limitations by examining the relative impact of demographic characteristics, religious and psychosocial factors, and life regret on death attitudes and psychological wellbeing for a diverse group of 153 hospice patients. In addition to relying on well-validated quantitative assessments, qualitative interviews were conducted with participants to further illustrate the role of study factors in shaping various dimensions of death anxiety or acceptance and quality of life. In general, results showed that factors assessed in this investigation were significantly correlated with death attitudes and emotional health. When study factors were examined simultaneously, gender, ethnicity, intrinsic religiosity, social support, and future-related regret each were shown to have a unique impact on various aspects of EOL adjustment and distress. The article concludes by offering direction to researchers interested in integrating and extending the empirical study of the attitudes of adults facing serious illness, and underscoring the clinical implications of these findings for professionals offering psychosocial and spiritual care at the end of life.

Abstract:In this article, the authors introduce the virtual dream, a technique that entails writing a brief spontaneous dreamlike story on themes of loss, using a flexible set of assigned elements of setting and characterization to scaffold the writing. After providing several examples of virtual dreams written by workshop participants, the authors analyze the frequency of important narrative features in a diverse sample of 143 stories to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of coding such accounts for clinical or research purposes. Finally, we conclude with some remarks on the therapeutic use of the virtual dream, whether as a prompt for personal reflection on themes of loss, as an exercise in the context of grief workshops or support groups, or as a homework assignment in grief counseling or therapy.

Abstract:Sharing grief experiences, or "storying"grief can be a key resource in adapting to loss, one that can contribute to stronger bonds and relational intimacy within the family. In this article, the authors conceptualize communication between grieving family members in terms of 3 "D" processes, emphasizing the extent to which such communication is dialectic, dialogic, and dynamic in nature. They illustrate the complexity of sharing about a mutual loss, focused on these 3 features, by referring to a case study of a couple coping with the death of a child in the context of a newly formed family. Rather than unilaterally advocating the promotion of open communication, the authors suggest that therapists working with bereaved families first discuss the complexities of communication with the family members, specifically those concerning talking and keeping silent, and explore the different meanings associated with sharing grief experiences with each other.

Abstract:A biodegradable, composite bone graft, composed of chitosan microspheres embedded in calcium sulfate, was evaluated in vitro for point-of-care loading and delivery of antibiotics and growth factors to prevent infection and stimulate healing in large bone injuries. Microspheres were loaded with rhBMP-2 or vancomycin prior to mixing into calcium sulfate loaded with vancomycin. Composites were evaluated for set time, drug release kinetics, and bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity of released vancomycin, induction of ALP expression by released rhBMP-2, and interaction of drugs on cells. Results showed the composite set in under 36 min and released vancomycin levels that were bactericidal to S. aureus (>MIC 8-16 mug/mL) for 18 days. Composites exhibited a 1 day-delayed release, followed by a continuous release of rhBMP-2 over 6 weeks; ranging from 0.06 to 1.49 ng/mL, and showed a dose dependent release based on initial loading. Released rhBMP-2 levels were, however, too low to induce detectable levels of ALP in W20-17 cells, due to the affinity of rhBMP-2 for calcium-based materials. With stimulating amounts of rhBMP-2 (>50 ng/mL), the ALP response from W-20-17 cells was inhibited when exposed to high vancomycin levels (1,800-3,600 mug/mL). This dual-delivery system is an attractive alternative to single delivery or preloaded systems for bone regeneration since it can simultaneously fight infection and deliver a potent growth factor. Additionally, this composite can accommodate a wide range of therapeutics and thus be customizable for specific patient needs, however, the potential interactive effects of multiple agents must be investigated to ensure that functional activity is not altered.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Reporting ototoxicity is frequently complicated by use of various ototoxicity criteria. The International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) ototoxicity grading scale was recently proposed for standardized use in reporting hearing loss outcomes across institutions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the concordance between the Chang and SIOP ototoxicity grading scales. Differences between the two scales were identified and the implications these differences may have in the clinical setting were discussed. PROCEDURES: Audiological evaluations were reviewed for 379 patients with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma (ages 3-21 years). Each patient was enrolled on one of two St. Jude clinical protocols that included craniospinal radiation therapy and four courses of 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin chemotherapy. The latest audiogram conducted 5.5-24.5 months post-protocol treatment initiation was graded using the Chang and SIOP ototoxicity criteria. Clinically significant hearing loss was defined as Chang grade >/=2a and SIOP >/=2. Hearing loss was considered serious (requiring a hearing aid) at the level of Chang grade >/=2b and SIOP >/=3. RESULTS: A strong concordance was observed between the Chang and SIOP ototoxicity scales (Stuart's tau-c statistic = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.91). Among those patients diagnosed with serious hearing loss, the two scales were in good agreement. However, the scales deviated from one another in classifying patients with less serious or no hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: Although discrepancies between the Chang and SIOP ototoxicity scales exist primarily for patients with no or minimal hearing loss, the scales share a strong concordance overall.

Abstract:The RNA-binding protein TDP-43 regulates RNA metabolism at multiple levels, including transcription, RNA splicing, and mRNA stability. TDP-43 is a major component of the cytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and some types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The importance of TDP-43 in disease is underscored by the fact that dominant missense mutations are sufficient to cause disease, although the role of TDP-43 in pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic mRNP granules that undergo bidirectional, microtubule-dependent transport in neurons in vitro and in vivo and facilitate delivery of target mRNA to distal neuronal compartments. TDP-43 mutations impair this mRNA transport function in vivo and in vitro, including in stem cell-derived motor neurons from ALS patients bearing any one of three different TDP-43 ALS-causing mutations. Thus, TDP-43 mutations that cause ALS lead to partial loss of a novel cytoplasmic function of TDP-43.

Abstract:Existing research indicates veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may deliberately inhibit the expression of emotion. However, the degree to which inhibition generalizes to other trauma populations and the specific reasons survivors with PTSD inhibit expression remains unclear. The present study looked to evaluate expressive inhibition among survivors of intimate partner violence (N = 74), to determine reasons for inhibition in this population, and to examine whether any justifications for inhibition are unique to individuals with PTSD. The frequency and intensity of inhibition scores were similar to those noted in previous research although no differences were observed across women with and without PTSD. Self-reported justifications for inhibition indicated five general themes: Concern for others, Mistrust/fear of exploitation, Perception of others as indifferent/uncaring, Control/Experiential avoidance, and Situation-specific inhibition. Only mistrust/exploitation motives were uniquely associated with PTSD. Whereas expressive inhibition may be elevated within help-seeking samples, individuals who develop PTSD appear to hold unique reasons for restricting emotional expression.

Title:Physical injury, PTSD symptoms, and medication use: examination in two trauma types.
Authors:['Cody MW', 'Beck JG']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:Physical injury is prevalent across many types of trauma experiences and can be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and physical health effects, including increased medication use. Recent studies suggest that PTSD symptoms may mediate the effects of traumatic injury on health outcomes, but it is unknown whether this finding holds for survivors of different types of traumas. The current study examined cross-sectional relationships between injury, PTSD, and pain and psychiatric medication use in 2 trauma-exposed samples, female survivors of motor vehicle accidents (MVAs; n = 315) and intimate partner violence (IPV; n = 167). Data were obtained from participants at 2 trauma research clinics who underwent a comprehensive assessment of psychopathology following the stressor. Regression with bootstrapping suggested that PTSD symptoms mediate the relationship between injury severity and use of pain medications, R(2) = .11, F(2, 452) = 28.37, p < .001, and psychiatric medications, R(2) = .06, F(2, 452) = 13.18, p < .001, as hypothesized. Mediation, however, was not moderated by trauma type (ps > .05). Results confirm an association between posttraumatic psychopathology and medication usage and suggest that MVA and IPV survivors alike may benefit from assessment and treatment of emotional distress after physical injury.

Abstract:This study critically examines the concepts of dignity and liminality at the end-of life, in an effort to better understand the processes of healing within suffering among Chinese terminal cancer patients receiving palliative care services in Hong Kong. Meaning-oriented interviews were conducted with 18 Chinese terminal patients, aged 44 to 98, to elicit the narratives and stories of their illness experience. All interviews were analyzed using grounded theory and supplemented by ethnographic observations and field notes. Two major themes and eight subprocesses of healing adopted by patients to achieve and maintain dignity were identified: (a) personal autonomy, which encompasses the need to (i) regain control over living environments, (ii) maintain self-sufficiency despite institutional care, (ii) make informed care decisions to reduce sense of burden, and (iv) engage in future planning to create a lasting legacy; and (b) family connectedness, which encompasses the need to (i) maintain close ties with family members to express appreciation, (ii) achieve reconciliation, (iii) fulfill family obligations, and (iv) establish a continuing bond that transcends generations. Implications of these themes for advanced care planning and life review interventions were discussed with the goal of enhancing patient autonomy and family connectedness, and thereby providing structure and meaning for Chinese terminal patients and their families at the end of life.

Abstract:This study examined patterns of making meaning among 155 parents whose children died from a variety of violent and non-violent causes. Findings indicated 53% of violent loss survivors could not make sense of their loss, as compared to 32% of non-violent loss survivors. Overall, there was overlap in sense-making strategies across different causes of death, with many parents invoking spiritual and religious meanings and the cultivation of empathy for the suffering of others. Nonetheless, violent loss survivors described the imperfection of the world and brevity of life more frequently in their narrative responses than parents who lost a child to natural causes, who in turn were more likely to find benefit in the loss in terms of personal growth. Violent loss survivors--and especially those losing a child to homicide--also reported enhanced appreciation of life more frequently than survivors of non-violent losses, and surviving a child's suicide was specifically associated with a change in priorities in the sample. Findings are discussed in terms of common and distinctive themes in meaning making that clinicians may encounter when working with parental bereavement, and the implications these carry for finding spiritual and secular significance in a traumatic loss.

Abstract:What proportion of genes with intense and selective expression in specific tissues, cells, or systems are still almost completely uncharacterized with respect to biological function? In what ways do these functionally enigmatic genes differ from well-studied genes? To address these two questions, we devised a computational approach that defines so-called ignoromes. As proof of principle, we extracted and analyzed a large subset of genes with intense and selective expression in brain. We find that publications associated with this set are highly skewed--the top 5% of genes absorb 70% of the relevant literature. In contrast, approximately 20% of genes have essentially no neuroscience literature. Analysis of the ignorome over the past decade demonstrates that it is stubbornly persistent, and the rapid expansion of the neuroscience literature has not had the expected effect on numbers of these genes. Surprisingly, ignorome genes do not differ from well-studied genes in terms of connectivity in coexpression networks. Nor do they differ with respect to numbers of orthologs, paralogs, or protein domains. The major distinguishing characteristic between these sets of genes is date of discovery, early discovery being associated with greater research momentum--a genomic bandwagon effect. Finally we ask to what extent massive genomic, imaging, and phenotype data sets can be used to provide high-throughput functional annotation for an entire ignorome. In a majority of cases we have been able to extract and add significant information for these neglected genes. In several cases--ELMOD1, TMEM88B, and DZANK1--we have exploited sequence polymorphisms, large phenome data sets, and reverse genetic methods to evaluate the function of ignorome genes.

Abstract:The purpose of this study was to contribute to the nascent literature on resilience and suicidality among Black Americans by examining factors that may predict less suicidal behavior among this population. The authors hypothesized that reasons for living, life satisfaction, and religious awareness would account for unique variance in suicidal thoughts and behavior among Black Americans, above the variance accounted for by depressive symptoms. They also hypothesized that reasons for living and religious awareness would be stronger inverse predictors among Black women than Black men. Results indicated that both depression and life satisfaction were stronger predictors of suicidal behavior among Black men. Among women, only reasons for living was a significant inverse predictor of suicidal thoughts and behavior. More frequent reasons for living moderated the relationship between depression and suicidal thoughts and behavior among Black women.

Title:Inventory of complicated spiritual grief: development and validation of a new measure.
Authors:['Burke LA', 'Neimeyer RA', 'Holland JM', 'Dennard S', 'Oliver L', 'Shear MK']
Affiliation:a Department of Psychology , University of Memphis , Memphis , Tennessee , USA.
Abstract:Although spirituality often has been associated with better outcomes following bereavement, it can be significantly challenged by loss as well. Studies have shown that some bereaved individuals suffer profoundly not only in relation to the death of their loved one but also in their relationship with God and their faith community, a condition known as complicated spiritual grief (CSG). However, to date, in the absence of a simple, multidimensional, and well-validated measure of spiritual crisis following loss, investigators have measured CSG with nongrief-specific instruments. In this study, the authors tested the reliability and validity of a newly developed measure of CSG, called the Inventory of Complicated Spiritual Grief (ICSG). With 2 diverse samples of bereaved adult Christians (total n = 304), the authors found that the ICSG had strong internal consistency, and high test-retest reliability for both subscales in a subsample of participants. Analyses of both samples supported a 2-factor model, with one factor measuring Insecurity with God and the other assessing Disruption in Religious Practice. Analyses further supported the convergent and incremental validity of the 18-item ICSG relative to other theoretically similar instruments and measures of poor bereavement outcome, suggesting its usefulness in clinical research and practice.

Title:Complicated spiritual grief I: relation to complicated grief symptomatology following violent death bereavement.
Authors:['Burke LA', 'Neimeyer RA']
Affiliation:a Department of Psychology , The University of Memphis , Memphis , Tennessee , USA.
Abstract:Losing a loved one to violent death has been associated with poor mental health outcomes, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and complicated grief (CG), a protracted, debilitating, and sometimes life-threatening reaction to loss. In addition, recent research suggests that traumatic loss can violate mourners' basic assumptive worldviews, and can precipitate a spiritual crisis following loss, also known as complicated spiritual grief (CSG). The present cross-sectional study investigated these multidimensional outcomes in a diverse sample of 150 grievers. The authors found that (a) violently bereaved individuals reported greater CG and CSG than did individuals bereaved by natural death; (b) CG and CSG were correlated across the larger sample, and yet are theoretically different constructs; and (c) specific cause of death (natural anticipated, natural sudden, homicide, suicide, or fatal accident) differentially predicted levels of CG and CSG. Implications of these findings for a clearer understanding of spiritual coping in the wake of troubling loss are noted, as well as for intervention with mourners struggling with clinical complications.

Authors:['Burke LA', 'Neimeyer RA', 'Young AJ', 'Bonin EP', 'Davis NL']
Affiliation:a Department of Psychology , The University of Memphis , Memphis , Tennessee , USA.
Abstract:Recent studies have revealed an association between complicated grief-a severe, prolonged response to the loss of a loved one-and complicated spiritual grief-a spiritual crisis following loss. Furthermore, bereavement research has benefitted from a number of studies using qualitative inquiry as a means of examining the experiences of individuals grieving a variety of types of losses. However, a gap in the literature remains in terms of the qualitative investigation of spiritual struggle following loss. Thus, using participants' written responses to open-ended questions along with systematic exploration of this topic with a five-member focus group, we designed this qualitative study to better understand the firsthand experiences of bereaved individuals who have suffered a crisis of faith after the death of a loved one. Specifically, our directed content analysis of bereaved focus group members' responses revealed 17 different common and salient themes subsumed in an overarching narrative of resentment and doubt toward God, dissatisfaction with the spiritual support received, and substantial changes in the bereaved person's spiritual beliefs and behaviors. Thus, our study clarified the construct of complicated spiritual grief, and laid the groundwork for development of more specific assessment and treatment of this condition.

Abstract:Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a well-known regulator of cell growth and proliferation in response to environmental stimuli and stressors. To date, the majority of mTORC1 studies have focused on its function as a cytoplasmic effector of translation regulation. However, recent studies have identified additional, nuclear-specific roles for mTORC1 signaling related to transcription of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and ribosomal protein (RP) genes, mitotic cell cycle control, and the regulation of epigenetic processes. As this area of study is still in its infancy, the purpose of this review to highlight these significant findings and discuss the relevance of nuclear mTORC1 signaling dysregulation as it pertains to health and disease.

Abstract:Members of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) family of transcriptional regulators are central mediators of the cellular inflammatory response. Although constitutive NF-kappaB signalling is present in most human tumours, mutations in pathway members are rare, complicating efforts to understand and block aberrant NF-kappaB activity in cancer. Here we show that more than two-thirds of supratentorial ependymomas contain oncogenic fusions between RELA, the principal effector of canonical NF-kappaB signalling, and an uncharacterized gene, C11orf95. In each case, C11orf95-RELA fusions resulted from chromothripsis involving chromosome 11q13.1. C11orf95-RELA fusion proteins translocated spontaneously to the nucleus to activate NF-kappaB target genes, and rapidly transformed neural stem cells--the cell of origin of ependymoma--to form these tumours in mice. Our data identify a highly recurrent genetic alteration of RELA in human cancer, and the C11orf95-RELA fusion protein as a potential therapeutic target in supratentorial ependymoma.

Abstract:Dopamine (DA) neurons in sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) display dysregulated gene expression networks and signaling pathways that are implicated in PD pathogenesis. Micro (mi)RNAs are regulators of gene expression, which could be involved in neurodegenerative diseases. We determined the miRNA profiles in laser microdissected DA neurons from postmortem sporadic PD patients' brains and age-matched controls. DA neurons had a distinctive miRNA signature and a set of miRNAs was dysregulated in PD. Bioinformatics analysis provided evidence for correlations of miRNAs with signaling pathways relevant to PD, including an association of miR-126 with insulin/IGF-1/PI3K signaling. In DA neuronal cell systems, enhanced expression of miR-126 impaired IGF-1 signaling and increased vulnerability to the neurotoxin 6-OHDA by downregulating factors in IGF-1/PI3K signaling, including its targets p85beta, IRS-1, and SPRED1. Blocking of miR-126 function increased IGF-1 trophism and neuroprotection to 6-OHDA. Our data imply that elevated levels of miR-126 may play a functional role in DA neurons and in PD pathogenesis by downregulating IGF-1/PI3K/AKT signaling and that its inhibition could be a mechanism of neuroprotection.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to fabricate, characterize and evaluate in vitro, an injectable calcium sulfate bone cement beads loaded with an antibiotic nanoformulation, capable of delivering antibiotic locally for the treatment of periodontal disease. METHODS: Tetracycline nanoparticles (Tet NPs) were prepared using an ionic gelation method and characterized using DLS, SEM, and FTIR to determine size, morphology, stability and chemical interaction of the drug with the polymer. Further, calcium sulfate (CaSO4) control and CaSO4-Tet NP composite beads were prepared and characterized using SEM, FTIR and XRD. The drug release pattern, material properties and antibacterial activity were evaluated. In addition, protein adsorption, cytocompatibility and alkaline phosphatase activity of the CaSO4-Tet NP composite beads in comparison to the CaSO4 control were analyzed. RESULTS: Tet NPs showed a size range of 130+/-20nm and the entrapment efficiency calculated was 89%. The composite beads showed sustained drug release pattern. Further the drug release data was fitted into various kinetic models wherein the Higuchi model showed higher correlation value (R(2)=0.9279) as compared to other kinetic models. The composite beads showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The presence of Tet NPs in the composite bead didn't alter its cytocompatibility. In addition, the composite beads enhanced the ALP activity of hPDL cells. CONCLUSIONS: The antibacterial and cytocompatible CaSO4-Tet NP composite beads could be beneficial in periodontal management to reduce the bacterial load at the infection site. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Tet NPs would deliver antibiotic locally at the infection site and the calcium sulfate cement, would itself facilitate tissue regeneration.

Abstract:This article presents an intensive analysis of a good outcome case of constructivist grief therapy with a bereaved mother, using the Innovative Moments Coding System (IMCS). Inspired by M. White and D. Epston's narrative therapy, the IMCS conceptualizes therapeutic change as resulting from the elaboration and expansion of unique outcomes (or as we prefer, innovative moments), referring to experiences not predicted by the problematic or dominant self-narrative. The IMCS identifies and tracks the occurrence of 5 different types of innovative moments: action, reflection, protest, re-conceptualization, and performing change. Results documented the process of meaning reconstruction over the 6 sessions of treatment, and demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of analyzing narrative change in this form of grief therapy, opening it to comparison with other approaches.

Abstract:Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC), especially those caused by human activities, is one of the most important components of global environmental change (Jessen 3(rd) edition: 1-526 2005). In this study the effects of geographic and demographic factors on LULCC are analyzed in northeastern Latvia using official estimates from census and vital statistics data, and using remotely sensed satellite imagery (Landsat Thematic Mapper) acquired from 1992 and 2007. The remote sensing images, elevation data, in-situ ground truth and ground control data (using GPS), census and vital statistics data were processed, integrated, and analyzed in a geographic information system (GIS). Changes in six categories of land-use and land-cover (wetland, water, agriculture, forest, bare field and urban/suburban) were studied to determine their relationship to demographic and geographic factors between 1992 and 2007. Supervised classifications were performed on the Landsat images. Analysis of land cover change based on "change-to" categories between the 1992 and 2007 images revealed that changes to forest were the most common type of change (17.1% of pixels), followed by changes to agriculture (8.6%) and the fewest were changes to urban/suburban (0.8%). Integration of population data and land-cover change data revealed key findings: areas near to roads underwent more LULCC and areas far away from Riga underwent less LULCC. Range in elevation was positively correlated with all LULCC categories. Population density was found to be associated with most LULCC categories but the direction of effect was scale dependent. This paper shows how socio-demographic data can be integrated with satellite image data and cartographic data to analyze drivers of LULCC at multiple spatial scales.

Abstract:Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome remains challenging partially because the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. While inflammation and loss of barrier function are associated with disease progression, our understanding of the biophysical mechanisms associated with ventilator-associated lung injury is incomplete. In this line of thinking, we recently showed that changes in the F-actin content and deformability of AECs lead to cell detachment with mechanical stretch. Elsewhere, we discovered that cytokine secretion and proliferation were regulated in part by the stretch-activated 2-pore domain K(+) (K2P) channel TREK-1 in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). As such, the aim of the current study was to determine whether TREK-1 regulated the mechanobiology of AECs through cytoskeletal remodeling and cell detachment. Using a TREK-1-deficient human AEC line (A549), we examined the cytoskeleton by confocal microscopy and quantified differences in the F-actin content. We used nano-indentation with an atomic force microscope to measure the deformability of cells and detachment assays to quantify the level of injury in our monolayers. We found a decrease in F-actin and an increase in deformability in TREK-1 deficient cells compared to control cells. Although total vinculin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) levels remained unchanged, focal adhesions appeared to be less prominent and phosphorylation of FAK at the Tyr(925) residue was greater in TREK-1 deficient cells. TREK-1 deficient cells have less F-actin and are more deformable making them more resistant to stretch-induced injury.

Abstract:Inclusion body myopathy (IBM) associated with Paget disease of the bone, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), sometimes called IBMPFD/ALS or multi system proteinopathy, is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of muscle, brain, motor neurons, and bone with prominent TDP-43 pathology. Recently, 2 novel genes for multi system proteinopathy were discovered; heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 and A2B1. Subsequently, a mutation in hnRNPA1 was also identified in a pedigree with autosomal dominant familial ALS. The genetic evidence for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases is still insufficient. We therefore sequenced the prion-like domain of these genes in 135 familial ALS, 1084 sporadic ALS, 68 familial FTD, 74 sporadic FTD, and 31 sporadic IBM patients in a Dutch population. We did not identify any mutations in these genes in our cohorts. Mutations in hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2B1 prove to be a rare cause of ALS, FTD, and IBM in the Netherlands.

Title:Discovery of novel second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase mimetics as selective inhibitor of apoptosis protein inhibitors.

Abstract:Inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are widely considered as promising cancer drug targets, especially for drug-resistant tumors. Mimicking the IAP-binding motif of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) is a rational strategy to design potential IAP inhibitors. In this report, we used the bioactive conformation of AVPI tetrapeptide in the N terminus of SMAC as a template and performed a shape-based virtual screening against a drug-like compound library to identify novel IAP inhibitors. Top hits were subsequently docked to available IAP crystal structures as a secondary screening followed by validation using in vitro biologic assays. Four novel hit compounds were identified to potently inhibit cell growth in two human melanoma (A375 and M14) and two human prostate (PC-3 and DU145) cancer cell lines. The best compound, UC-112 [5-((benzyloxy)methyl)-7-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)quinolin-8-ol], has IC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 3.4 microM. UC-112 also potently inhibits the growth of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-overexpressed multidrug-resistant cancer cells, strongly activates caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 activities, and selectively downregulates survivin level at a concentration as low as 1 microM. Coincubation of UC-112 with a known proteasome inhibitor Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO (MG-132) rescued survivin inhibition, consistent with the anticipated mechanism of action for UC-112. As a single agent, UC-112 strongly inhibits tumor growth and reduces both X chromosome-linked IAP and survivin levels in an A375 human melanoma xenograft model in vivo. Overall, our study identified novel scaffolds, especially UC-112, as new platforms on which potent and selective IAP antagonists can be developed.

Abstract:INTRODUCTION: In diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG), subtracting pre-contrast from post-contrast T1-weighted images (T1WI) occasionally reveals subtle, "occult" enhancement. We hypothesized that this represents intravascular enhancement related to angiogenesis and hence that these tumors should have greater blood volume fractions than do non-enhancing tumors. METHODS: We retrospectively screened MR images of 66 patients initially diagnosed with DIPG and analyzed pretreatment conventional and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) perfusion MRI studies of 61 patients. To determine the incidence of occult enhancement, cerebral blood volume (CBV) values were compared in areas of occult enhancement (OcE), no enhancement (NE), and normal-appearing deep cerebellar white matter (DCWM). RESULTS: Tumors of 10 patients (16.4 %) had occult enhancement; those of 6 patients (9.8 %) had no enhancement at all. The average CBV in areas of occult enhancement was significantly higher than that in non-enhancing areas of the same tumor (P = .03), within DCWM in the same patient (P = .03), and when compared to anatomically paired/similar regions of interest (ROI) in patients with non-enhancing tumors (P = .005). CONCLUSION: Areas of OcE correspond to areas of higher CBV in DIPG, which may be an MRI marker for angiogenesis, but larger scale studies may be needed to determine its potential relevance to grading by imaging, treatment stratification, biopsy guidance, and evaluation of response to targeted therapy.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: Waterpipe use has increased dramatically in the Middle East and other parts of the world. Many users exhibit signs of dependence, including withdrawal and difficulty quitting, but there is no evidence base to guide cessation efforts. METHODS: We developed a behavioral cessation program for willing-to-quit waterpipe users, and evaluated its feasibility and efficacy in a pilot, two arm, parallel group, randomized, open label trial in Aleppo, Syria. Fifty adults who smoked waterpipe >/=3 times per week in the last year, did not smoke cigarettes, and were interested in quitting were randomized to receive either brief (1 in-person session and 3 phone calls) or intensive (3 in-person sessions and 5 phone calls) behavioral cessation treatment delivered by a trained physician in a clinical setting. The primary efficacy end point of the developed interventions was prolonged abstinence at three months post-quit day, assessed by self-report and exhaled carbon monoxide levels of <10 ppm. Secondary end points were 7 day point-prevalent abstinence and adherence to treatment. RESULTS: Thirty percent of participants were fully adherent to treatment, which did not vary by treatment group. The proportions of participants in the brief and intensive interventions with prolonged abstinence at the 3-month assessment were 30.4% and 44.4%, respectively. Previous success in quitting (OR=3.57; 95% CI=1.03-12.43) predicted cessation. Higher baseline readiness to quit, more confidence in quitting, and being unemployed predicted a better adherence to treatment (all p-values <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Brief behavioral cessation treatment for waterpipe users appears to be feasible and effective.

Abstract:Understanding the impact of geological events on diversification processes is central to evolutionary ecology. The recent amalgamation between ecological niche models (ENMs) and phylogenetic analyses has been used to estimate historical ranges of modern lineages by projecting current ecological niches of organisms onto paleoclimatic reconstructions. A critical assumption underlying this approach is that niches are stable over time. Using Notophthalmus viridescens (eastern newt), in which four ecologically diverged subspecies are recognized, we introduce an analytical framework free from the niche stability assumption to examine how refugial retreat and subsequent postglacial expansion have affected intraspecific ecological divergence. We found that the current subspecies designation was not congruent with the phylogenetic lineages. Thus, we examined ecological niche overlap between the refugial and modern populations, in both subspecies and lineage, by creating ENMs independently for modern and estimated last glacial maximum (LGM) newt populations, extracting bioclimate variables by randomly generated points, and conducting principal component analyses. Our analyses consistently showed that when tested as a hypothesis, rather than used as an assumption, the niches of N. viridescens lineages have been unstable since the LGM (both subspecies and lineages). There was greater ecological niche differentiation among the subspecies than the modern phylogenetic lineages, suggesting that the subspecies, rather than the phylogenetic lineages, is the unit of the current ecological divergence. The present study found little evidence that the LGM refugial retreat caused the currently observed ecological divergence and suggests that ecological divergence has occurred during postglacial expansion to the current distribution ranges.

Abstract:Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) express members of the tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), but the role of those receptors in the thymic development of Treg cells is undefined. We found here that Treg cell progenitors had high expression of the TNFRSF members GITR, OX40 and TNFR2. Expression of those receptors correlated directly with the signal strength of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and required the coreceptor CD28 and the kinase TAK1. The neutralization of ligands that are members of the TNF superfamily (TNFSF) diminished the development of Treg cells. Conversely, TNFRSF agonists enhanced the differentiation of Treg cell progenitors by augmenting responsiveness of the interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) and transcription factor STAT5. Costimulation with the ligand of GITR elicited dose-dependent enrichment for cells of lower TCR affinity in the Treg cell repertoire. In vivo, combined inhibition of GITR, OX40 and TNFR2 abrogated the development of Treg cells. Thus, expression of members of the TNFRSF on Treg cell progenitors translated strong TCR signals into molecular parameters that specifically promoted the development of Treg cells and shaped the Treg cell repertoire.

Title:The impact of counselor self-disclosure on clients: a meta-analytic review of experimental and quasi-experimental research.

Abstract:In an attempt to make sense of contradictory findings, meta-analysis was used to review 53 studies that examined counselor self-disclosure (CSD) vs. nondisclosure. CSD, overall, was found to have a favorable impact on clients/participants, with clients/participants having favorable perceptions of disclosing counselors and rating themselves more likely to disclose to counselors who had self-disclosed. Specifically, CSD that (a) revealed similarity between client and counselor; (b) was of negative content valence; or (c) was related to intra- or, especially, extratherapy experiences, had favorable impacts on clients/participants compared with nondisclosure. These types of disclosure resulted in more favorable perceptions of the counselor, especially in the area of professional attractiveness. CSD that revealed similarity between client and counselor also had a favorable impact on clients'/participants' allegiance-specifically, on their willingness to return-to disclosing counselors. Significant moderators of the impact of CSD on clients included researcher bias for or against CSD, type of "session" (e.g., written transcript, interview, real session), timing of CSD (whether before or after client self-disclosure), verb tense of extratherapy CSD, experimental setting, type of control group, and the number of CSDs in the experiment. Clinical implications include that CSD may be beneficial for building rapport, strengthening alliance, and eliciting client disclosure, with similar CSD being especially beneficial.

Abstract:Redissection of discarded lung resection specimens after routine pathology examination reveals missed lymph node metastasis. We sought to determine if size can be used to grossly select lymph nodes for microscopic examination. This is a prospective cohort study of lymph nodes retrieved from discarded lung resection specimens. The association between size and histologic characteristics of retrieved material was compared by the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. We retrieved 1094 grossly 'lymph node-like" tissue from 112 remnant lung resection specimens, of which 345 (32%) proved not to be lymph nodes and 71 (9%) of 749 lymph nodes had metastasis. Metastasis was present in discarded nodes in 26 (23%) of 112 patients. The non-lymph node tissue was significantly smaller than lymph nodes (P < .0001); lymph nodes with metastases were significantly larger than those without metastases (P < .0001). However, there was significant size overlap between the 3 types of grossly lymph node-like tissue. Thirty-two percent of nodes with metastasis were less than 1 cm; 15% of patients had at least 1 lymph node less than 1 cm with metastasis. The size difference between lymph nodes with and without metastasis is clinically unhelpful because of broad overlap. Size is insufficiently discriminatory and cannot be relied on to select materials for histologic examination. A third of grossly retrieved material was non-lymph node tissue. This probably occurs during routine pathologic examination and likely contributes to the low N1 lymph node count.

Abstract:25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3) is used as a clinical biomarker for assessment of vitamin D status. Blood levels of 25OHD3 represent a balance between its formation rate and clearance by several oxidative and conjugative processes. In the present study, the identity of human uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronyltransferases (UGTs) capable of catalyzing the 25OHD3 glucuronidation reaction was investigated. Two isozymes, UGT1A4 and UGT1A3, were identified as the principal catalysts of 25OHD3 glucuronidation in human liver. Three 25OHD3 monoglucuronides (25OHD3-25-glucuronide, 25OHD3-3-glucuronide, and 5,6-trans-25OHD3-25-glucuronide) were generated by recombinant UGT1A4/UGT1A3, human liver microsomes, and human hepatocytes. The kinetics of 25OHD3 glucuronide formation in all systems tested conformed to the Michaelis-Menten model. An association between the UGT1A4*3 (Leu48Val) gene polymorphism with the rates of glucuronide formation was also investigated using human liver microsomes isolated from 80 genotyped livers. A variant allele dose effect was observed: the homozygous UGT1A4*3 livers (GG) had the highest glucuronidation activity, whereas the wild type (TT) had the lowest activity. Induction of UGT1A4 and UGT1A3 gene expression was also determined in human hepatocytes treated with pregnane X receptor/constitutive androstane receptor agonists, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital. Although UGT mRNA levels were increased significantly by all of the known pregnane X receptor/constitutive androstane receptor agonists tested, rifampin, the most potent of the inducers, significantly induced total 25OHD3 glucuronide formation activity in human hepatocytes measured after 2, but not 4 and 24 hours, of incubation. Finally, the presence of 25OHD3-3-glucuronide in both human plasma and bile was confirmed, suggesting that the glucuronidation pathway might be physiologically relevant and contribute to vitamin D homeostasis in humans.

Abstract:INTRODUCTION: Waterpipe (also known as hookah) smoking is increasing around the world, including the United States, where waterpipe bars have sprung up rapidly around college campuses. Users are exposed to several toxicants, including carbon monoxide (CO). We evaluated change in exhaled CO and estimated carboxyhemoglobin levels among waterpipe bar patrons in Tampa, FL. METHODS: Exhaled breath samples were obtained immediately before entering and after leaving 6 waterpipe bars in Tampa, FL to measure CO boost and factors affecting CO change. Demographics, cigarette use status, and characteristics of waterpipe use during the bar visit also were assessed. RESULTS: Among the sample of 166 participants, mean CO increased from 6.5 parts per million (ppm) to 58.2 ppm (a 795% relative boost; p < .001). CO change was higher for patrons who were dual (waterpipe plus cigarette) smokers compared with waterpipe-only smokers, and significant factors of CO change were frequency of waterpipe use, number of charcoals, number of tobacco bowls, and time spent in the bar (all p values < .05). CONCLUSION: U.S. waterpipe bar patrons are exposed to considerable amounts of CO, which could put them at risk of acute illness and chronic heart and lung diseases. Environmental and policy controls are needed to curb this increasingly popular tobacco use method in the United States.

Abstract:Hypoxic stress and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play important roles in a wide range of tumors. We demonstrate that SPOP, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase component, is a direct transcriptional target of HIFs in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Furthermore, hypoxia results in cytoplasmic accumulation of SPOP, which is sufficient to induce tumorigenesis. This tumorigenic activity occurs through the ubiquitination and degradation of multiple regulators of cellular proliferation and apoptosis, including the tumor suppressor PTEN, ERK phosphatases, the proapoptotic molecule Daxx, and the Hedgehog pathway transcription factor Gli2. Knockdown of SPOP specifically kills ccRCC cells, indicating that it may be a promising therapeutic target. Collectively, our results indicate that SPOP serves as a regulatory hub to promote ccRCC tumorigenesis.

Abstract:Raman scattering is an inelastic phenomenon. Although its cross section is very small, recent advances in electronics, lasers, optics, and nanotechnology have made Raman spectroscopy suitable in many areas of application. The present article reviews the applications of Raman spectroscopy in food and drug analysis and inspection, including those associated with nanomaterials. Brief overviews of basic Raman scattering theory, instrumentation, and statistical data analysis are also given. With the advent of Raman enhancement mechanisms and the progress being made in metal nanomaterials and nanoscale metal surfaces fabrications, surface enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy has become an extra sensitive method, which is applicable not only for analysis of foods and drugs, but also for intracellular and intercellular imaging. A Raman spectrometer coupled with a fiber optics probe has great potential in applications such as monitoring and quality control in industrial food processing, food safety in agricultural plant production, and convenient inspection of pharmaceutical products, even through different types of packing. A challenge for the routine application of surface enhanced Raman scattering for quantitative analysis is reproducibility. Success in this area can be approached with each or a combination of the following methods: (1) fabrication of nanostructurally regular and uniform substrates; (2) application of statistic data analysis; and (3) isotopic dilution.

Abstract:MATR3 is an RNA- and DNA-binding protein that interacts with TDP-43, a disease protein linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia. Using exome sequencing, we identified mutations in MATR3 in ALS kindreds. We also observed MATR3 pathology in ALS-affected spinal cords with and without MATR3 mutations. Our data provide more evidence supporting the role of aberrant RNA processing in motor neuron degeneration.

Abstract:For decades, mouse and other rodents have been used for the study of oxidative or related studies such as the effect of fluoride. It is known that rodents normally synthesize their own vitamin C (VC) due to the presence of a key enzyme in ascorbic acid synthesis, l-gulono-lactone-gamma-oxidase (Gulo), while humans do not have the capacity of VC synthesis due to the deletion of most parts of the GULO gene. The spontaneous fracture (sfx) mouse recently emerged as a model for study of VC deficiency. We investigated the effect of fluoride on liver cells from wild type Balb/c and sfx mice. We found that activities of SOD, GPx, and CAT were reduced in both wild type and sfx mice; however, the amount of reduction in the sfx cells is more than that in Balb/c cells. In addition, while both cells increased MDA, the increase in the sfx cells is greater than that in Balb/c cells. Gene networks of Sod, Gpx, and Cat in the liver of humans and mice are also different. Our study suggests that reaction to fluoride in vitamin C deficient mice might be different from that of wild type mice.

Abstract:In animals, circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior result from coherent rhythmic interactions between clocks in the brain and those throughout the body. Despite the many tissue specific clocks, most understanding of the molecular core clock mechanism comes from studies of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus and a few other cell types. Here we report establishment and genetic characterization of three cell-autonomous mouse clock models: 3T3 fibroblasts, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and MMH-D3 hepatocytes. Each model is genetically tractable and has an integrated luciferase reporter that allows for longitudinal luminescence recording of rhythmic clock gene expression using an inexpensive off-the-shelf microplate reader. To test these cellular models, we generated a library of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against a panel of known clock genes and evaluated their impact on circadian rhythms. Knockdown of Bmal1, Clock, Cry1, and Cry2 each resulted in similar phenotypes in all three models, consistent with previous studies. However, we observed cell type-specific knockdown phenotypes for the Period and Rev-Erb families of clock genes. In particular, Per1 and Per2, which have strong behavioral effects in knockout mice, appear to play different roles in regulating period length and amplitude in these peripheral systems. Per3, which has relatively modest behavioral effects in knockout mice, substantially affects period length in the three cellular models and in dissociated SCN neurons. In summary, this study establishes new cell-autonomous clock models that are of particular relevance to metabolism and suitable for screening for clock modifiers, and reveals previously under-appreciated cell type-specific functions of clock genes.

Abstract:Pediatric osteosarcoma is characterized by multiple somatic chromosomal lesions, including structural variations (SVs) and copy number alterations (CNAs). To define the landscape of somatic mutations in pediatric osteosarcoma, we performed whole-genome sequencing of DNA from 20 osteosarcoma tumor samples and matched normal tissue in a discovery cohort, as well as 14 samples in a validation cohort. Single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) exhibited a pattern of localized hypermutation called kataegis in 50% of the tumors. We identified p53 pathway lesions in all tumors in the discovery cohort, nine of which were translocations in the first intron of the TP53 gene. Beyond TP53, the RB1, ATRX, and DLG2 genes showed recurrent somatic alterations in 29%-53% of the tumors. These data highlight the power of whole-genome sequencing for identifying recurrent somatic alterations in cancer genomes that may be missed using other methods.

Abstract:Pediatric high-grade glioma (HGG) is a devastating disease with a less than 20% survival rate 2 years after diagnosis. We analyzed 127 pediatric HGGs, including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) and non-brainstem HGGs (NBS-HGGs), by whole-genome, whole-exome and/or transcriptome sequencing. We identified recurrent somatic mutations in ACVR1 exclusively in DIPGs (32%), in addition to previously reported frequent somatic mutations in histone H3 genes, TP53 and ATRX, in both DIPGs and NBS-HGGs. Structural variants generating fusion genes were found in 47% of DIPGs and NBS-HGGs, with recurrent fusions involving the neurotrophin receptor genes NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 in 40% of NBS-HGGs in infants. Mutations targeting receptor tyrosine kinase-RAS-PI3K signaling, histone modification or chromatin remodeling, and cell cycle regulation were found in 68%, 73% and 59% of pediatric HGGs, respectively, including in DIPGs and NBS-HGGs. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the unique and shared pathways driving pediatric HGG within and outside the brainstem.

Abstract:The Connected Speech Test (CST) is used to measure the intelligibility of everyday speech; it is intended primarily for quantifying hearing aid benefit. The test consists of 48 passages of conversationally produced connected speech, each passage concerning a familiar topic and comprising 10 sentences. Listeners are apprised of the passage topic in advance and are required to repeat the sentences one at a time. Each passage contains 25 scoring words. The test is recorded audiovisually. In previous papers, we have reported the development of the test materials and investigations of the use of the audio portion with normally hearing and hearing-impaired listeners. Audio versions of the test have been developed for use with normal hearers (CST version 1), and for hearing-impaired listeners (CST version 2). In the present paper, we report a study of the test administered audiovisually. Twenty-six normally hearing subjects responded to audiovisual presentation of all 48 test passages. On the basis of the results, a new version of the test (CST version 3) was generated. In this new version, the test passages are presented in designated sets of four or six passages. The critical difference between two scores is estimated to be the same for both audio and audiovisual administration.

Abstract:The objective of this study was to evaluate a cost-effectiveness strategy of bevacizumab in a subset of high-risk advanced ovarian cancer patients with survival benefit. Methods. A subset analysis of the International Collaboration on Ovarian Neoplasms 7 trial showed that additions of bevacizumab (B) and maintenance bevacizumab (mB) to paclitaxel (P) and carboplatin (C) improved the overall survival (OS) of high-risk advanced cancer patients. Actual and estimated costs of treatment were determined from Medicare payment. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per life-year saved was established. Results. The estimated cost of PC is $535 per cycle; PCB + mB (7.5 mg/kg) is $3,760 per cycle for the first 6 cycles and then $3,225 per cycle for 12 mB cycles. Of 465 high-risk stage IIIC (>1 cm residual) or stage IV patients, the previously reported OS after PC was 28.8 months versus 36.6 months in those who underwent PCB + mB. With an estimated 8-month improvement in OS, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of B was $167,771 per life-year saved. Conclusion. In this clinically relevant subset of women with high-risk advanced ovarian cancer with overall survival benefit after bevacizumab, our economic model suggests that the incremental cost of bevacizumab was approximately $170,000.

Abstract:Over the last decades, researchers have characterized a set of "clock genes" that drive daily rhythms in physiology and behavior. This arduous work has yielded results with far-reaching consequences in metabolic, psychiatric, and neoplastic disorders. Recent attempts to expand our understanding of circadian regulation have moved beyond the mutagenesis screens that identified the first clock components, employing higher throughput genomic and proteomic techniques. In order to further accelerate clock gene discovery, we utilized a computer-assisted approach to identify and prioritize candidate clock components. We used a simple form of probabilistic machine learning to integrate biologically relevant, genome-scale data and ranked genes on their similarity to known clock components. We then used a secondary experimental screen to characterize the top candidates. We found that several physically interact with known clock components in a mammalian two-hybrid screen and modulate in vitro cellular rhythms in an immortalized mouse fibroblast line (NIH 3T3). One candidate, Gene Model 129, interacts with BMAL1 and functionally represses the key driver of molecular rhythms, the BMAL1/CLOCK transcriptional complex. Given these results, we have renamed the gene CHRONO (computationally highlighted repressor of the network oscillator). Bi-molecular fluorescence complementation and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrate that CHRONO represses by abrogating the binding of BMAL1 to its transcriptional co-activator CBP. Most importantly, CHRONO knockout mice display a prolonged free-running circadian period similar to, or more drastic than, six other clock components. We conclude that CHRONO is a functional clock component providing a new layer of control on circadian molecular dynamics.

Title:A social constructionist account of grief: loss and the narration of meaning.
Authors:['Neimeyer RA', 'Klass D', 'Dennis MR']
Affiliation:a Department of Psychology , University of Memphis , Memphis , Tennessee , USA.
Abstract:In contrast to dominant Western conceptions of bereavement in largely intrapsychic terms, the authors argue that grief or mourning is not primarily an interior process, but rather one that is intricately social, as the bereaved commonly seek meaning in this unsought transition in not only personal and familial, but also broader community and even cultural spheres. The authors therefore advocate a social constructionist model of grieving in which the narrative processes by which meanings are found, appropriated, or assembled occur at least as fully between people as within them. In this view, mourning is a situated interpretive and communicative activity charged with establishing the meaning of the deceased's life and death, as well as the postdeath status of the bereaved within the broader community concerned with the loss. They describe this multilevel phenomenon drawing first on psychological research on individual self-narratives that organize life experience into plot structures that display some level of consistency over time, whose viability is then negotiated in the intimate interpersonal domain of family and close associates. Second, they explore public communication, including eulogies, grief accounts in popular literature, and elegies. All of these discourses construct the identity of the deceased as he or she was, and as she or he is now in the individual and communal continuing bonds with the deceased. Finally, they consider different cultural contexts to see how expressions of grief are policed to ensure their coherence with the prevailing social and political order. That is, the meanings people find through the situated interpretive and communicative activity that is grieving must either be congruent with the meanings that undergird the larger context or represent an active form of resistance against them.

Abstract:Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) is a type of hematological malignancy that affects two percent of the overall population in the United States. Tetraspanin CD9 is a cell surface protein that has been thoroughly demonstrated to be a molecular facilitator of cellular phenotype. CD9 expression varies in two human lymphoma cell lines, Raji and BJAB. In this report, we investigated the functional relationship between CD9 and cell proliferation regulated by histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in these two cell lines. Introduction of CD9 expression in Raji cells resulted in significantly increased cell proliferation and HDAC activity compared to Mock transfected Raji cells. The increase in CD9-Raji cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) treatment. Pretreatment of BJAB cells with HDAC inhibitors resulted in a significant decrease in endogenous CD9 mRNA and cell surface expression. BJAB cells also displayed decreased cell proliferation after HDACi treatment. These results suggest a significant relationship between CD9 expression and cell proliferation in human lymphoma cells that may be modulated by HDAC activity.

Abstract:AIM: To discover novel [20(OH)D3] analogs as antiproliferative therapeutics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied in vitro liver microsome stability, in vivo toxicity using mice, vitamin D receptor (VDR) translocation, in vitro antiproliferative effect, CYP enzyme metabolism. RESULTS: 20S- and 20R(OH)D3 had reasonable half-lives of 50 min and 30 min (average) respectively in liver microsomes. They were non-hypercalcemic at a high dose of 60 mug/kg. Three new 20(OH)D3 analogs were designed, synthesized and tested. They showed higher or comparable potency for inhibition of proliferation of normal keratinocytes and in the induction of VDR translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus, compared to 1,25(OH)2D3. These new analogs demonstrated different degrees of metabolism through a range of vitamin D-metabolizing CYP enzymes. CONCLUSION: Their lack of calcemic toxicity at high doses and their high biological activity suggest that this novel 20(OH)D3 scaffold may represent a promising platform for further development of therapeutically-useful agents.

Title:Inhibitory modulation by cAMP of isoproterenol-induced prostacyclin synthesis in rabbit heart.
Authors:['Williams JL Jr', 'Malik KU']
Affiliation:Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163.
Abstract:beta-Adrenergic receptor activation in heart is associated with enhanced production of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and prostaglandins (PG). The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that cAMP mediates or modulates PG synthesis elicited by activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the isolated, perfused rabbit heart. Infusion of 8-(4-chlorophenylthio) (cpt)-cAMP (100 microM), an analogue of cAMP, or stimulation of endogenous cAMP generation with forskolin (2 microM) resulted in a reduction of perfusion pressure and an increase in heart rate and contractility but had no effect on 6-keto-PGF1 alpha output. 6-Keto-PGF1 alpha production elicited by a bolus injection of isoproterenol (Isop) (475 pmol), however, was reduced by greater than 50% in the presence of these agents, cpt-cAMP was also found to inhibit 6-keto-PGF1 alpha output elicited by the calcium ionophore A23187 but not that in response to exogenous arachidonic acid. Perfusion with the adenosine analogue adenylate cyclase inhibitor PIA (1 microM) enhanced by twofold Isop-stimulated output of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, whereas cAMP accumulation was prevented. Isop-stimulated production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was inhibited by 50% in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (50 microM), Ro 20-1724 (300 microM), or cilostamide (5 microM), whereas both basal and Isop-stimulated cAMP accumulations were enhanced by these agents. These data suggest that cAMP acts as an inhibitory modulator of PG synthesis in response to beta-adrenergic receptor activation in rabbit heart.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based treatment planning using pseudo CTs generated through atlas registration. METHODS: A pseudo CT, providing electron density information for dose calculation, was generated by deforming atlas CT images previously acquired on other patients. The authors tested 4 schemes of synthesizing a pseudo CT from single or multiple deformed atlas images: use of a single arbitrarily selected atlas, arithmetic mean process using 6 atlases, and pattern recognition with Gaussian process (PRGP) using 6 or 12 atlases. The required deformation for atlas CT images was derived from a nonlinear registration of conjugated atlas MR images to that of the patient of interest. The contrasts of atlas MR images were adjusted by histogram matching to reduce the effect of different sets of acquisition parameters. For comparison, the authors also tested a simple scheme assigning the Hounsfield unit of water to the entire patient volume. All pseudo CT generating schemes were applied to 14 patients with common pediatric brain tumors. The image similarity of real patient-specific CT and pseudo CTs constructed by different schemes was compared. Differences in computation times were also calculated. The real CT in the treatment planning system was replaced with the pseudo CT, and the dose distribution was recalculated to determine the difference. RESULTS: The atlas approach generally performed better than assigning a bulk CT number to the entire patient volume. Comparing atlas-based schemes, those using multiple atlases outperformed the single atlas scheme. For multiple atlas schemes, the pseudo CTs were similar to the real CTs (correlation coefficient, 0.787-0.819). The calculated dose distribution was in close agreement with the original dose. Nearly the entire patient volume (98.3%-98.7%) satisfied the criteria of chi-evaluation (<2% maximum dose and 2 mm range). The dose to 95% of the volume and the percentage of volume receiving at least 95% of the prescription dose in the planning target volume differed from the original values by less than 2% of the prescription dose (root-mean-square, RMS < 1%). The PRGP scheme did not perform better than the arithmetic mean process with the same number of atlases. Increasing the number of atlases from 6 to 12 often resulted in improvements, but statistical significance was not always found. CONCLUSIONS: MRI-based treatment planning with pseudo CTs generated through atlas registration is feasible for pediatric brain tumor patients. The doses calculated from pseudo CTs agreed well with those from real CTs, showing dosimetric accuracy within 2% for the PTV when multiple atlases were used. The arithmetic mean process may be a reasonable choice over PRGP for the synthesis scheme considering performance and computational costs.

Abstract:DNA damage is considered to be a prime factor in several spinocerebellar neurodegenerative diseases; however, the DNA lesions underpinning disease etiology are unknown. We observed the endogenous accumulation of pathogenic topoisomerase-1 (Top1)-DNA cleavage complexes (Top1ccs) in murine models of ataxia telangiectasia and spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy 1. We found that the defective DNA damage response factors in these two diseases cooperatively modulated Top1cc turnover in a non-epistatic and ATM kinase-independent manner. Furthermore, coincident neural inactivation of ATM and DNA single-strand break repair factors, including tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase-1 or XRCC1, resulted in increased Top1cc formation and excessive DNA damage and neurodevelopmental defects. Notably, direct Top1 poisoning to elevate Top1cc levels phenocopied the neuropathology of the mouse models described above. Our results identify a critical endogenous pathogenic lesion associated with neurodegenerative syndromes arising from DNA repair deficiency, indicating that genome integrity is important for preventing disease in the nervous system.

Abstract:Excessive weight gain is common after renal transplantation, but it is unknown whether environmental factors, such as food availability, contribute to this important clinical problem. We evaluated the effects of food availability (fast food restaurants, convenience stores, and grocery stores within 1, 2, and 3 mile buffers of transplant recipients' residences) on body mass index (BMI) change during the first year post-transplant. Participants (n = 299) resided in Memphis, Tennessee. BMI increased by 1.42 units (p < .001) corresponding to an average weight gain of 9.25 lbs (5.43%) during the first year post-transplant. The number of grocery stores within 1 mile of recipient's residence was associated with an increase in BMI (p < .05), but fast food restaurants and convenience stores were not significantly associated with BMI change.

Abstract:Soil flooding in wetlands is accompanied by changes in soil physical and chemical characteristics. These changes include the lowering of soil redox potential (Eh) leading to increasing demand for oxygen within the soil profile as well as production of soil phytotoxins that are by-products of soil reduction and thus, imposing potentially severe stress on plant roots. Various methods are utilized for quantifying plant responses to reducing soil conditions that include measurement of radial oxygen transport, plant enzymatic responses, and assessment of anatomical/morphological changes. However, the chemical properties and reducing nature of soil environment in which plant roots are grown, including oxygen demand, and other associated processes that occur in wetland soils, pose a challenge to evaluation and comparison of plant responses that are reported in the literature. This review emphasizes soil-plant interactions in wetlands, drawing attention to the importance of quantifying the intensity and capacity of soil reduction for proper evaluation of wetland plant responses, particularly at the process and whole-plant levels. Furthermore, while root oxygen-deficiency may partially account for plant stress responses, the importance of soil phytotoxins, produced as by-products of low soil Eh conditions, is discussed and the need for development of methods to allow differentiation of plant responses to reduced or anaerobic soil conditions vs. soil phytotoxins is emphasized.

Abstract:Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients are at high risk of contracting pneumococcal infection. To address this risk, they receive pneumococcal vaccines, and antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment. To assess the impact of SCD and these interventions on pneumococcal genetic architecture, we examined the genomes of more than 300 pneumococcal isolates from SCD patients over 20 years. Modern SCD strains retained invasive capacity but shifted away from the serotypes used in vaccines. These strains had specific genetic changes related to antibiotic resistance, capsule biosynthesis, metabolism, and metal transport. A murine SCD model coupled with Tn-seq mutagenesis identified 60 noncapsular pneumococcal genes under differential selective pressure in SCD, which correlated with aspects of SCD pathophysiology. Further, virulence determinants in the SCD context were distinct from the general population, and protective capacity of potential antigens was lost over time in SCD. This highlights the importance of understanding bacterial pathogenesis in the context of high-risk individuals.

Abstract:Tumor metastasis remains the major cause of cancer-related death, but its molecular basis is still not well understood. Here we uncovered a splicing-mediated pathway that is essential for breast cancer metastasis. We show that the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M (hnRNPM) promotes breast cancer metastasis by activating the switch of alternative splicing that occurs during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Genome-wide deep sequencing analysis suggests that hnRNPM potentiates TGFbeta signaling and identifies CD44 as a key downstream target of hnRNPM. hnRNPM ablation prevents TGFbeta-induced EMT and inhibits breast cancer metastasis in mice, whereas enforced expression of the specific CD44 standard (CD44s) splice isoform overrides the loss of hnRNPM and permits EMT and metastasis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the ubiquitously expressed hnRNPM acts in a mesenchymal-specific manner to precisely control CD44 splice isoform switching during EMT. This restricted cell-type activity of hnRNPM is achieved by competition with ESRP1, an epithelial splicing regulator that binds to the same cis-regulatory RNA elements as hnRNPM and is repressed during EMT. Importantly, hnRNPM is associated with aggressive breast cancer and correlates with increased CD44s in patient specimens. These findings demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism through which tumor metastasis is endowed by the hnRNPM-mediated splicing program.

Title:Characterization of phosphorylated amino acids by fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
Authors:['Dass C']
Affiliation:Charles B. Stout Neuroscience Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, University of Tennessee-Memphis 38163.
Abstract:Positive- and negative-ion fast-atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometry and linked-field scan techniques at constant B/E are used to characterize phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine amino acids. Abundant molecular ions are formed for all three amino acids in both modes of ionization. The dominant fragmentation is cleavage of the phosphate ester bond with charge retention in positive-ion FAB by the amino acid backbone and in the negative-ion mode by the phosphate group. The unique feature of positive-ion FAB mass spectra of phosphoserine and -threonine is the loss, from the ion [M + H]+, of a molecule of phosphoric acid (98 Da), whereas the corresponding tyrosine expels a HPO4 (96 Da) moiety to yield a stable phenylalanine ion.

Abstract:Previous histopathologic studies of sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) identified sarcoplasmic aggregation and myonuclear depletion of the predominantly nuclear heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) TDP-43 in sIBM myofibers. Here, we examined sIBM muscle for abnormalities in two other hnRNPs hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2B1, mutations in which cause multisystem proteinopathy associated with rimmed-vacuolar myopathies. Muscle biopsy specimens from 13 patients with sIBM and 13 patients without sIBM (dermatomyositis N=3, polymyositis N=3, muscular dystrophy N=3, motor neuron disease N=2, non-neuromuscular disease N=2) underwent immunohistochemistry for hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2B1, and TDP-43. Muscle transcriptional microarray data from 27 patients with sIBM and 12 patients without neuromuscular disease was analyzed. Depletion of hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2B1 was present in 15% and 7% of sIBM myonuclei, respectively, compared with 1% and 0% of myonuclei in non-sIBM muscle. Sarcoplasmic aggregates of hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2B1 distinct from TDP-43 aggregates were also found in sIBM. hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2B1, as well as other hnRNPs, gene expression was unaltered in sIBM compared to normal muscle. Along with TDP-43, other hnRNPs, including hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2B1, are depleted from sIBM myonuclei at the protein but not transcript level. The depletion of multiple hnRNPs from sIBM myonuclei together with their sarcoplasmic aggregation suggests that one aspect of sIBM pathophysiology may involve abnormal RNA metabolism that includes hyperassembly of ribonucleoprotein granules mediated by prion-like domains in hnRNPs, evolving into pathological aggregates.

Abstract:Biofeedback and related behavioral approaches have been employed for decades in the management of recurrent headache conditions, with ample evidence to support their clinical utility. Initially, these treatments were employed entirely in the office and required an extended number of face-to-face sessions. Researchers have entered a new era wherein they are focusing on ways to make these treatments less intensive on the part of therapists, less expensive on the part of patients, more widely available and accessible, and retain their level of effectiveness. Initial efforts have focused on PLOT, group, internet, and mass media delivery approaches. This article discusses further approaches being explored to continue to extend behavioral treatment options for patients, focusing on alternative approaches for managing headaches, discussing the value of exercise, addressing depression and sleep problems more directly, and incorporating techniques of motivational interviewing. The importance, role, and value of patient education are stressed throughout.

Abstract:Mutations in the PFN1 gene encoding profilin 1 are a rare cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Profilin 1 is a well studied actin-binding protein but how PFN1 mutations cause ALS is unknown. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has one PFN1 ortholog. We expressed the ALS-linked profilin 1 mutant proteins in yeast, demonstrating a loss of protein stability and failure to restore growth to profilin mutant cells, without exhibiting gain-of-function toxicity. This model provides for simple and rapid screening of novel ALS-linked PFN1 variants. To gain insight into potential novel roles for profilin 1, we performed an unbiased, genome-wide synthetic lethal screen with yeast cells lacking profilin (pfy1Delta). Unexpectedly, deletion of several stress granule and processing body genes, including pbp1Delta, were found to be synthetic lethal with pfy1Delta. Mutations in ATXN2, the human ortholog of PBP1, are a known ALS genetic risk factor and ataxin 2 is a stress granule component in mammalian cells. Given this genetic interaction and recent evidence linking stress granule dynamics to ALS pathogenesis, we hypothesized that profilin 1 might also associate with stress granules. Here we report that profilin 1 and related protein profilin 2 are novel stress granule-associated proteins in mouse primary cortical neurons and in human cell lines and that ALS-linked mutations in profilin 1 alter stress granule dynamics, providing further evidence for the potential role of stress granules in ALS pathogenesis.

Abstract:UNLABELLED: Teledentistry has the potential to address the oral care needs of those who have limited access to care. More research is needed to establish the evidence base to support teledentistry practice. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enormous potential exists to improve oral health services throughout the world by using information and communication technologies, such as teledentistry to expand access to primary, secondary and tertiary care. Comparison of teledentistry procedures with standard clinical procedures can demonstrate the relative effectiveness and cost of each approach. However, due to insufficient evidence, it is unclear how these strategies compare for improving and maintaining oral health, quality of life, and reducing health care costs. This review discusses the merits of teledentistry for the delivery of oral care. METHODS: This article summarizes the available literature related to the efficacy and effectiveness of teledentistry and presents possible barriers to its broader adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Teledentistry seems to be a promising path for providing oral health services where there is a shortage of oral health care providers.

Title:Onset of vitellogenin production and vitellogenesis, and their relationship to changes in the midgut epithelium and oocytes in the tick Dermacentor variabilis.
Authors:['Coons LB', 'Lamoreaux WJ', 'Rosell-Davis R', 'Tarnowski BI']
Affiliation:Biology Department, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:In Dermacentor variabilis (Say), the onset of vitellogenin production and vitellogenesis (uptake of vitellogenin into oocytes) began during the rapid-engorgement feeding period. Mating was required for both vitellogenin production and vitellogenesis to complete the tick's life cycle. Complete immunological identity, as measured by Ouchterlony's double diffusion test, existed between vitellogenin from the fat body, midgut and hemolymph, and vitellin from the ovaries and eggs. Antivitellin antibody did not react with host hemoglobin nor with fat body, midgut, and ovary extracts from feeding females prior to rapid engorgement, feeding unmated females, or unfed or fed males. Some unmated females fed for 13 days and then hand-detached from the host eventually began oviposition after going through a preoviposition period. In these ticks, organ extracts from the midgut, fat body and ovary reacted with antivitellin antibody. The presence or absence of presumed vitellogenic cells in the midgut and yolk bodies in oocytes corresponded with the presence or absence of vitellogenin and vitellogenesis as measured by Ouchterlony's test. Presumed vitellogenic cells increased in size during the preoviposition period. These cells reached their greatest size during the time when the most eggs were being produced, and then declined in size toward the end of oviposition. Vitellogenin was deposited directly into developing yolk bodies in oocytes and was not processed through lysosomes. Feeding was the process that initiated the formation of eggshell cuticle. Detachment from the host was required for the initiation of oviposition.

Title:Characterization of beta-endorphin in human pituitary by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry of trypsin-generated fragments.
Authors:['Dass C', 'Fridland GH', 'Tinsley PW', 'Killmar JT', 'Desiderio DM']
Affiliation:Charles B. Stout Neuroscience Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, College of Medicine, University of Tennessee, Memphis.
Abstract:A novel mass spectrometric method possessing a high level of structural specificity is described for characterization in biological fluids and tissues of endogenous beta-endorphin of the human amino acid sequence (beta h-EP). The method is based upon purification of tissue extracts by an RP-HPLC gradient, followed by trypsinolysis of that particular HPLC fraction corresponding to the elution time of synthetic beta h-EP. The tryptic digest of that endogenous beta h-EP fraction was purified further by a second RP-HPLC gradient. A unique tryptic fragment selected from the second gradient was analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and B/E linked-field scan MS/MS techniques to provide molecular weight and amino acid sequence-determining fragment ion information, respectively, of that fragment. Collectively, these independent analytical methodologies provided unequivocal structure evidence for the presence of endogenous beta h-EP in human pituitary. The method was established first by utilizing synthetic beta h-EP to optimize experimental parameters, and then applied to the analysis of beta h-EP in post-mortem human pituitary extracts. The suitability of the present method for semi-quantitation of tissue extracts is also demonstrated. The corresponding detection limit of the synthetic beta h-EP was 90 fmol, and human pituitary contained 1.5 pmol of beta h-EP mg-1 protein. The method can be extended readily to the analysis of beta-endorphin derived from other species and tissues.

Title:Platelet-aggregation is stimulated by lactose-inhibitable snake venom lectins.
Authors:['Ogilvie ML', 'Byl JW', 'Gartner TK']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Five lactose-specific lectins from snake venoms were tested for the ability to stimulate the aggregation of human platelets. Three of the lectins, bushmaster (Lachesis muta), cottonmouth (Ancistrodon piscivorous leukostoma) and rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) lectins, consistently stimulated secretion and aggregation. Thrombolectin (Bothrops atrox) occasionally caused aggregation. Copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix) lectin did not by itself cause platelet aggregation. Lactose, a specific inhibitor of hemagglutination mediated by these lectins was a potent inhibitor of lectin-induced aggregation. Antiserum specific for bushmaster lectin inhibited aggregation by bushmaster lectin. In contrast, the same antiserum and anti-cottonmouth lectin serum enhanced aggregation by low levels of the other lectins. A variety of substances were assayed in the aggregometer for the ability to inhibit aggregation in response to these lectins. Both secretion and aggregation were inhibited by PGI2 and PGE1. Furthermore, lectin-induced aggregation was completely blocked by trifluoperazine and partially blocked by indomethacin. Monoclonal antibodies specific for GP IIb/IIIa (AP2, A2A9, LJP5, LJCP8) but not monoclonals directed against other platelet membrane proteins (AP1 and AP3) inhibited lectin-induced aggregation. The peptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser but not Arg-Ala-Asp-Ser was a potent inhibitor of aggregation.

Title:Comfortable loudness level: stimulus effects, long-term reliability, and predictability.
Authors:['Cox RM']
Affiliation:Memphis State University.
Abstract:This paper reports the results of a series of investigations of comfortable loudness levels with particular reference to their application to hearing aid gain prescriptions. Experiment 1 studied the effects of several stimulus waveforms, bandwidths, and durations on comfortable loudness levels for normal and hearing impaired listeners. Speech band comfort levels were found to be significantly higher than equal-duration noise band or warble tone comfort levels. Comfortable loudness levels were found to be independent of warble tone modulation parameters and of stimulus bandwidth (stimuli did not exceed critical bandwidths). In Experiment 2, reliability of comfortable loudness levels was evaluated in hearing-impaired subjects over two consecutive 1-year periods. Results indicated that comfortable loudness levels were slightly less reliable than thresholds. In addition, the results were consistent with a hypothesis that exposure to amplified sound produces a small increase in comfortable loudness levels. In Experiment 3, data from 67 hearing-impaired subjects were used to develop regression equations for prediction of comfortable loudness levels. Thresholds at the test frequencies were combined with comfortable loudness data at 500 Hz and 4,000 Hz. The prediction method was then evaluated using a new group of 25 subjects. Accuracy of predictions of comfort levels was substantially better with the new method than with an older method that relied exclusively on threshold data. Relevance of the outcomes to hearing aid fitting procedures is discussed.

Title:A developmental analysis of the influence of body weight on the sociometry of children.
Authors:['Cohen R', 'Klesges RC', 'Summerville M', 'Meyers AW']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:The influence of relative weight on sociometric nominations (liking and disliking) and sociometric ratings by first, third, and fifth graders was assessed. In terms of nominations, first grade overweight males, relative to other males and to overweight females, received fewer liking nominations. On the sociometric ratings, third grade overweight males were rated lower by other males. Ratings by females at each grade level, and by fifth grade males, were influenced by gender considerations and not by weight considerations. That is, boys rated boys higher than they rated girls, and girls rated girls higher than they rated boys, regardless of the child's weight status. Additional analyses demonstrated that these findings were not qualified by the weight of the child making the ratings. Thus, developmental evidence was found for less liking (but not disliking) of overweight peers among first and third grade males, while weight did not appear to influence the decisions of fifth graders. These results call into question the validity of a social stigma often assumed to be associated with overweight children.

Title:Development of the Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) test for hearing aid comparisons.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'McDaniel DM']
Affiliation:Memphis State University.
Abstract:The Speech Intelligibility Rating (SIR) Test has been developed for use in clinical comparisons of hearing aid conditions. After listening to a short passage of connected speech, subjects generate a rating proportional to its intelligibility using an equal-appearing interval scale from 0 to 10. Before test passages are presented, the signal-to-babble ratio (SBR) is adjusted to a level that elicits intelligibility ratings of 7-8 for a "setup" passage. Then, with SBR held constant, three or more test passages are rated and the results averaged for each aided condition. This paper describes the generation of recorded test materials and their investigation using normally hearing listeners. Based on these data, a critical difference of about 2 scale intervals is recommended. A future paper will deal with results for hearing-impaired subjects.

Title:Relationship between feeding, mating, vitellogenin production and vitellogenesis in the tick Dermacentor variabilis.
Authors:['Rosell-Davis R', 'Coons LB']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Anti-vitellin IgG directed against Dermacentor variabilis egg vitellin was used in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gradient gel immunoblots to detect the presence of vitellin and its precursor, vitellogenin, in the organs of feeding adults and in the immature stages of this tick. Vitellin polypeptides were found in the egg, larvae, nymph, and in the unfed adult stages of both sexes. Vitellin polypeptides were first detected in the ovary of mated females during the rapid-engorgement feeding period. These polypeptides were also present in the ovaries of ovipositing females, unmated females fed for extended periods, and fed unmated females that were detached from the host and held for 12 h before dissection. The same anti-vitellin antibody was used in immunoblots to monitor the appearance of vitellogenin in the organs and hemolymph of female ticks. Immunoreactive peptides of vitellogenin were found in the fat body, midgut, and hemolymph of pre-rapid-engorging mated and unmated females. These polypeptides were not found in fed males nor in Malpighian tubes of feeding or ovipositing females. Our data supported the following conclusions: 1) presence of immunoreactive vitellogenin in the adult female fat body, hemolymph, and midgut was dependent upon feeding; 2) in mated feeding females, we could not detect the uptake of vitellogenin by the ovary until rapid engorgement; 3) in unmated females, vitellogenesis did not begin unless prolonged feeding occurred; and 4) during the early developmental stages of this tick, vitellin served as an embryonic nutrient reserve and as a reserve against starvation between feedings.

Title:The automatic extraction of pitch perturbation using microcomputers: some methodological considerations.
Authors:['Deem JF', 'Manning WH', 'Knack JV', 'Matesich JS']
Affiliation:Memphis State University.
Abstract:A program for the automatic extraction of jitter (PAEJ) was developed for the clinical measurement of pitch perturbations using a microcomputer. The program currently includes 12 implementations of an algorithm for marking the boundary criteria for a fundamental period of vocal fold vibration. The relative sensitivity of these extraction procedures for identifying the pitch period was compared using sine waves. Data obtained to date provide information for each procedure concerning the effects of waveform peakedness and slope, sample duration in cycles, noise level of the analysis system with both direct and tape recorded input, and the influence of interpolation. Zero crossing extraction procedures provided lower jitter values regardless of sine wave frequency or sample duration. The procedures making use of positive- or negative-going zero crossings with interpolation provided the lowest measures of jitter with the sine wave stimuli. Pilot data obtained with normal-speaking adults indicated that jitter measures varied as a function of the speaker, vowel, and sample duration.

Title:Calmodulin activity in whole body and fat body tissue extracts of Heliothis virescens larvae.
Authors:['Lockey TD', 'Ourth DD']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Calmodulin is an activator of many enzymatic activities. Total calmodulin activity in tissue extracts of Heliothis virescens larvae (5th instar), assayed by cyclic phosphodiesterase activation, was 0.48 unit/gm for whole body and 22.2 units/gm for fat body. Specific calmodulin activity was 0.1 unit/mg protein for whole body and 3.0 units/mg protein for fat body. The larval fat body is therefore the main site of calmodulin activity in this lepidopterous larva.

Abstract:In this paper we propose a stochastic model for the AIDS spread in a homosexual population. The probability generating function (PGF) of the numbers of latent persons, infective persons and AIDS cases is derived. By using the PGF, it is shown that the expected numbers and variances and covariances of these persons satisfy some ordinary differential equations. These equations have been solved numerically to assess effects of various factors on AIDS spread.

Abstract:The presence of the free opioid pentapeptide methionine enkephalin (ME) and of ME-containing peptide(s) was established firmly in decalcified, depulped human teeth by using a combination of methods including RP-HPLC, radioimmunoassay, radioreceptorassay, trypsin, carboxypeptidase B, fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and MS/MS methodology. Positive structural identification of ME was made with mass spectrometry. Those data demonstrate the presence of the preproenkephalinergic A system in the human trigeminal sensory termini.

Title:Use of the Connected Speech Test (CST) with hearing-impaired listeners.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC', 'Gilmore C', 'Pusakulich KM']
Affiliation:Department of Audiology & Speech Pathology, Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:Two studies were performed in which hearing-impaired subjects responded to the Connected Speech Test (CST). In experiment 1, 40 subjects, divided into four groups according to extent and configuration of hearing loss, responded to the CST version 1 (CSTv1). This version of the test consisted of 57 passages of connected speech: 48 test passages and 9 practice passages. It was developed on the basis of data for normal-hearing listeners. Performance of hearing-impaired listeners for the CSTv1 revealed that, although the passages were equal in average intelligibility for normal hearers, they were not equally intelligible for hearing-impaired persons. Based on results of data analyses, the 57 passages were reconstituted into 28 pairs of passages: 24 test pairs and 4 practice pairs. The pairs were equal in average intelligibility for both normal and hearing-impaired listeners. This form of the test was named the CST version 2 (CSTv2). In experiment 2, an additional 23 hearing-impaired subjects responded to the CSTv2. Critical differences and the slope of the signal to babble ratio (SBR) function were determined for the CSTv2 for hearing-impaired listeners. When two CSTv2 pairs were used per score, the 95% critical difference for hearing-impaired subjects was about 15.5 rationalized arcsine units (rau). The mean SBR function slope for hearing-impaired listeners was 8.5 rau/dB. Comparing the critical difference with the SBR function slope, it may be seen that, for hearing-impaired listeners, differences in intelligibility equivalent to a 2 dB change in SBR can be detected with CST scores based on mean performance across two passage pairs.

Title:Distribution of short-term rms levels in conversational speech.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Matesich JS', 'Moore JN']
Affiliation:Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38105.
Abstract:For 30 male and 30 female talkers, distributions of short-term rms speech levels, relative to the corresponding long-term rms levels, were determined in each of eight 1/3-oct bands for six short-term measurement intervals. Consecutive, Hanning-windowed, 20-ms time records were combined to produce nominal measurement intervals ranging from 20 to 120 ms. For each measurement interval, mean distributions of short-term rms speech levels relative to long-term levels were very similar for male and female talkers, and intertalker differences were small, especially for short-term amplitudes above the median level. The distribution of short-term rms speech levels relative to long-term rms speech levels varied with measurement interval for the short-term measurements. The effects of measurement interval was least for the highest amplitude speech levels and increased as speech levels decreased. For short-term amplitudes above the median level, the effect of measurement interval was greater in higher frequency regions, whereas for short-term amplitudes below the median level, measurement interval had the greatest effect on the lower frequency bands. These data may facilitate comparisons among investigations using different measurement intervals. In addition, they have implications for amplification strategies.

Affiliation:University of Tennessee, Charles B. Stout Neuroscience Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Memphis 38163.
Abstract:A mass spectral characterization of a set of anthracyclines and anthracyclinones comprised of daunorubicin, adriamycin and their modified analogs was carried out by using negative and positive fast atom bombardment (FAB) ionization techniques. Addition of more than one hydrogen to the molecular ions of the anthracyclines was observed. The choice of the FAB matrix played an important role in the characterization of these compounds. The dominant ions in the molecular ion region were M-. (or M+.) and MH- (or MH+.2) when sulfolane and glycerol, respectively, were employed as the FAB solvents. The major fragmentation was cleavage of the glycosidic bond with the charge retention mainly on the aglycone moiety. Aromatization of the tetracyclic ring promoted further fragmentation of the aglycone moiety. The anthracyclinones could be characterized only by negative FAB ionization using sulfolane as the FAB matrix. The assigned fragmentation pathways were confirmed by acquiring metastable ion spectra using B/E linked-field scans.

Title:Heat transfer analysis of frictional heat dissipation during articulation of femoral implants.
Authors:['Davidson JA', 'Gir S', 'Paul JP']
Affiliation:Materials Research Department, Richards Medical Company, Memphis, Tennessee.
Abstract:Previous studies have shown the tendency for frictional heating to occur during articulation of total hip systems in vitro under simulated hip loading conditions. The magnitude of this heating is sufficient to accelerate wear, creep, and oxidation degradation of the UHMWPE bearing surface. It was shown that ceramic articulating systems generate less frictional heating than polished cobalt alloy against UHMWPE. This frictional heating is expected to occur primarily for younger, heavier, and more active patients. Thus, long-term performance of the articulating hip system in these patients may not be that predicted from current, body-temperature wear, creep, and degradation studies. Although the tendency to generate frictional heat has been observed only during in vitro simulated hip loading, a heat transfer analysis of this phenomenon is presented to evaluate the ability of the hip joint to dissipate such heating in vivo. Additional experiments were performed using controlled resistance heaters inside a cobalt femoral head to verify the calculated levels of frictional heat and to assess the heat dissipation under simulated in vivo conditions. The effect of blood perfusion on the effective thermal conductivity of the joint capsule is also discussed. The present study describes and analyzes the various heat dissipation mechanisms present both in vitro and in vivo during articulation of metal and ceramic hip systems. From these tests and analyses, it is concluded that frictional heating in the reconstructed hip cannot be effectively removed, and that degredative elevated temperature processes can be expected to occur in vivo to both the UHMWPE and adjacent tissue under extended periods of excessive patient activity. This is particularly true for metal cobalt alloy femoral heads articulating on UHMWPE versus ceramic heads which generate significantly lower levels of heat.

Title:Composite speech spectrum for hearing and gain prescriptions.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Moore JN']
Affiliation:Memphis Speech and Hearing Center, TN 38105.
Abstract:Average long-term RMS 1/3-octave band speech spectra were generated for 30 male and 30 female talkers. The two spectra were significantly different in both low and high frequency bands but were similar in the mid-frequency region. It was concluded that a single spectrum could validly be used to represent both male and female speech in the frequency region important for hearing aid gain prescriptions: 250 Hz through 6300 Hz. In addition, the male and female spectra were compared with analogous spectra reported by Byrne (1977) and Pearsons, Bennett, and Fidell (1977). For each sex, significant differences were found among the three spectra in a few frequency bands. The best estimate of the average speech spectrum for each sex was obtained from a weighted average of the three sets of data, excluding the significantly different data points. The long-term RMS 1/3-octave band speech spectrum for male and female talkers combined was derived for use in hearing aid gain prescriptions.

Title:Wear, creep, and frictional heating of femoral implant articulating surfaces and the effect on long-term performance--Part II, Friction, heating, and torque.

Abstract:In Part I, (J.A. Davidson and G. Schwartz, "Wear, creep, and frictional heating of femoral implant articulating surfaces and the effect on long-term performance--Part I, A review," J. Biomed. Mater. Res., 21, 000-000 (1987) it was shown that lubrication of the artificial hip joint was complex and that long-term performance is governed by the combined wear, creep, and to a lesser extent, oxidation degradation of the articulating materials. Importantly, it was shown that a tendency for heating exists during articulation in the hip joint and that elevated temperatures can increase the wear, creep, and oxidation degradation rate of UHMWPE. The present study was performed to examine closely the propensity to generate heat during articulation in a hip joint simulator. The systems investigated were polished Co-Cr-Mo alloy articulating against UHMWPE, polished alumina ceramic against UHMWPE, and polished alumina against itself. Frictional torque was also evaluated for each system at various levels of applied loads. A walking load history was used in both the frictional heating and torque tests. The majority of tests were performed with 5 mL of water lubricant. However, the effect of various concentrations of hyaluronic acid was also evaluated. Results showed frictional heating to occur in all three systems, reaching an equilibrium after roughly 30 min articulation time. Ceramic systems showed reduced levels of heating compared to the cobalt alloy-UHMWPE system. The level of frictional torque for each system ranked similar to their respective tendencies to generate heat. Hyaluronic acid had little effect, while dry conditions and the presence of small quantities of bone cement powder in water lubricant significantly increased frictional torque.

Title:Electroacoustic calibration for sound field warble tone thresholds.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'McCormick VA']
Affiliation:Memphis State University, TN.
Abstract:Walker, Dillon, and Byrne (1984) suggested reference equivalent threshold sound pressure levels (RETSPLs) for warble tones with specific modulation parameter values audited from a test position at the critical distance in a semireverberant sound field. This study evaluated these RETSPLs in two typical audiometric rooms and with typically encountered FM tones. Thresholds were measured under earphones and in two sound fields for 6-11 normal hearers at six test frequencies. Results indicated that there was a small but statistically significant difference between earphone and sound field thresholds in 4 of 24 comparisons. However, in both sound fields, 99% of the sound field thresholds were within 10 dB of the earphone thresholds. It is concluded that these RETSPLs are appropriate for electroacoustic calibration of sound field warble tones similar to those used in this study.

Title:Bacterial sialic acid modulates activation of the alternative complement pathway of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus).
Authors:['Ourth DD', 'Bachinski LM']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:The alternative complement pathway (ACP) provides the non-immune channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) with protection against many Gram-negative bacteria. Very little serum bactericidal activity (0-13%) was found against 8 fish pathogens, but a strong bactericidal response (100%) was found against 7 non-pathogens. MgEGTA chelation of catfish serum did not essentially change the bactericidal results. Catfish serum heated at 56 degrees C and serum adsorbed with zymosan had no bactericidal activity. This demonstrated that the ACP was responsible for the bactericidal response. The molecular nature of the microbial surface determines whether or not the ACP will be activated. A relative lack of surface sialic acid has been found to be important for binding complement Factor B of the ACP by susceptible microbial surfaces. This study therefore examined the 15 Gram-negative bacterial fish pathogens and non-pathogens by determining their sialic acid content and their ability to elicit a bactericidal response by the catfish ACP. It was found that there was very little bactericidal activity against the fish pathogens that contained sialic acid but a very strong bactericidal response (100%) against the non-pathogens that lacked sialic acid (p = .0043). A relative lack of sialic acid or no sialic acid therefore correlated with a strong bactericidal response by the catfish ACP. Neuraminidase treatment of the bacterial fish pathogens to remove sialic acid greatly increased the bactericidal response against them by the catfish ACP when compared with untreated bacteria (p = .0431).

Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC', 'Gilmore C']
Affiliation:Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:This paper describes the first phase in the development of the Connected Speech Test (CST). This test of intelligibility of everyday speech has been developed primarily for use as a criterion measure in investigations of hearing aid benefit. The test consists of 48 passages of conversationally produced connected speech. Each passage contains 25 key words for scoring. All passages are of equal intelligibility for the average normal hearer. Key words vary in intelligibility within a passage but span the same intelligibility range in all passages. Several passages are administered, and the results averaged, to yield a single intelligibility score. For pairs of scores, each based on mean performance across 4 randomly-chosen passages, the 95% critical difference is estimated to be about 14 rationalized arcsine units (rau). The performance-intensity function for the CST has a slope of 12 rau/dB signal-to-babble ratio. Investigations of the test are continuing with hearing-impaired listeners.

Abstract:By combining the Michaelis-Menten kinetics of metabolism with the two-stage model of Moolgavkar and Knudson (1981) and the extended two-stage model of carcinogenesis proposed by Tan and Gastardo (1985), this paper proceeds to investigate the effects of metabolism of carcinogens on cancer tumor development. It is shown that the nonlinear kinetics of metabolism of carcinogens affect the dose-response relationship mainly through the mutation rates. If the initiator is affected by metabolism, then the metabolism of promoters has very little or negligible effects of the expected incidences and the number of tumors.

Abstract:Gastrulation is characterized by dramatic cell migration which is thought to require the interaction of cell adhesion molecules with extracellular molecules. We have tested two novel peptides, a fibronectin peptide and a fibronectin receptor peptide, for their effects on gastrulation of the leopard frog Rana pipiens. The fibronectin peptide DRVPHSRNSIT corresponds to residues 1373-1383 of the cell-binding domain of fibronectin; the receptor peptide DLYYLMDL corresponds to residues 124-131 of beta 1 subunit of a variety of integrins including alpha 5 beta 1. Either of these peptides significantly inhibited gastrulation after being microinjected into mid-blastulae. These results indicate that these sequences may correspond to the ligand/receptor interaction sites of fibronectin and its receptor(s).

Title:Cognitive behavioral strategies in athletic performance enhancement.
Authors:['Meyers AW', 'Whelan JP', 'Murphy SM']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, USA.
Abstract:While we might debate the role of sport in our culture, its influence is certainly pervasive. Each day millions of Americans engage in some form of competition, training, or physical exercise. Such popularity and the value our culture places on competition have made sport a valid area of psychological inquiry. Within the cognitive behavioral model, sport psychology and, specifically, athletic performance enhancement have experienced vigorous growth over the past two decades. Behavior change strategies familiar to most cognitive behaviorists form the core of virtually all athletic performance enhancement interventions. Goal setting, imagery or mental rehearsal, relaxation training, stress management, self-monitoring, self-instruction, cognitive restructuring, and modeling interventions dominate this literature. Our examination of these performance enhancement programs, both through a qualitative review and the Whelan et al. (1989) meta-analysis, supports the efficacy of cognitive behavioral interventions for the enhancement of sport performance. First, the average effect size across the empirical literature indicates that these interventions are reliably effective. Furthermore, this positive result is observed across variations in treatment conditions, control conditions, and across different types of dependent measures. Evidence on goal setting, imagery, arousal management, cognitive self-regulation, and packaged programs specifically support the behavior change efficacy of these interventions. These findings are encouraging, but much work needs to be done. Few investigators cited in this review attend to crucial internal and external validity issues. Attention to treatment integrity, including training of behavior change agents, verification of intervention implementation, and verification of reception of the treatment, is sorely lacking. Psychological skill development and its relationship to performance improvements are rarely checked. Now that cognitive behavioral interventions appear to be reliably effective at posttreatment, we must have meaningful evaluation of maintenance of psychological skill and performance changes. Six-month, 12-month, and longer follow-up evaluations are necessary. We must also begin more detailed evaluations of these effective interventions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

Title:Amino acid sequence determination of phosphoenkephalins using liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry.
Authors:['Dass C', 'Mahalakshmi P']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry (LSIMS) operating in the positive- and negative-ion modes was used to study fragmentation profiles and to obtain the amino acid sequences of a set of seven phosphoenkephalin peptides. The use of glycerol as the liquid matrix led to increase in fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The prominent amino acid sequence-determining ions in the positive-ion mode are y-type C-terminal ions; the N-terminal sequence-specific ions are observed sporadically. The most dominant ions in those mass spectra, however, are the immonium ions and a few low-mass side-chain cleavage products. The mass spectra in the negative-ion mode are more information-rich, and provide data complementary to that from the positive-ion mode. The phosphate group marker ions, m/z 79 (PO-3) and 97 (H2PO-4), are prominent and both N- and C-termini sequence ions are formed with equal facility in this mode of analysis. Both positive- and negative-ion mass spectral data are useful in determining the amino acid sequence of all the seven phosphoenkephalins. Thus, LSIMS alone can be a viable option to the tandem mass spectrometry approach when sufficient quantities (> 50 nmol) of phosphopeptides are available.

Abstract:EBV-induced lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-LPD) is a disorder most commonly associated with the immunocompromise that follows allogeneic organ transplantation. In patients receiving T cell-depleted bone marrow from HLA-mismatched or HLA-matched unrelated donors, the incidence of EBV-LPD is particularly high, ranging from 5 to 30%. Administration of EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes may be one means of preventing and treating this disease. We now describe a method that allows the routine and timely preparation of large numbers of such cells to allow their safe administration to bone marrow transplant recipients. We also describe how these cells may be genetically marked before infusion, to determine their fate and disposition in vivo.

Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Two surface analytical spectroscopic techniques (namely, angular-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and static secondary ion mass spectrometry) were used to characterize the nature and composition of the surface and near-surface layers formed on three biomedical polymers (namely, low-density polyethylene, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and a silicone elastomer) when exposed to Factor Xa in a buffer solution under adsorption conditions. It is shown that the results extracted from the spectroscopic measurements are consistent with each other. The clinical significance of the results is discussed in terms of screening biomedical polymers for use in fabricating cardiovascular system components.

Affiliation:School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, University of Memphis, TN 38105, USA.
Abstract:The purposes of this study were to determine the incidence of significant threshold shift (STS) for a large number of Naval fleet personnel, evaluate hearing conservation program (HCP) compliance for a large number of Naval ships, and determine whether two currently used compliance measures are useful means of evaluating HCP effectiveness. Data were collected from 12,492 medical records of 154 ships/submarines regarding STS incidence and follow-up, percent of valid audiograms, and other HCP elements. Data analyses suggested that STS incidence (29%) and follow-up compliance (62%) among fleet personnel may be too high and low, respectively, although audiogram compliance is 80.0 to 92.9%. Also, checklists commonly used to evaluate HCP compliance were not highly correlated with STS incidence. The data support literature recommendations for audiometric data base analyses to evaluate HCP effectiveness and for training for medical officers involved in the HCP. Recommendations and future implications are discussed.

Title:A full likelihood procedure for analysing exchangeable binary data.
Authors:['George EO', 'Bowman D']
Affiliation:Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:A full-likelihood procedure is proposed for analyzing correlated binary data under the assumption of exchangeability. The binomial and beta-binomial models are shown to occur as special cases correspondingly, respectively, to the choice of degenerate and beta-mixing distributions. For a finite exchangeable binary sequence of random variables, expressions for the joint distribution, moments, and correlations of all orders are derived. Maximum likelihood estimates of the moments of all orders are computed and used to estimate correlations and the distribution of the number of responses in a cluster. In an application to developmental toxicology data analysis, the procedure introduced is compared with a beta-binomial and a generalized estimating equation procedure in which mean response and intralitter correlation are linked to dose.

Abstract:PURPOSE: We evaluated the clinical efficacy of preirradiation carboplatin (CARBO) and etoposide (VP-16) in 25 patients with newly diagnosed embryonal CNS tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with high-risk medulloblastoma and nine with other embryonal tumors were treated with two daily doses of CARBO 350 mg/m2 and VP-16 100 mg/m2 (CARBO/VP) every 21 days for four cycles before standard craniospinal irradiation. Patients with disease progression (PD) before radiation therapy were additionally treated with intensive postirradiation cyclophosphamide (CYCLO) and vincristine (VINC). RESULTS: Among 23 assessable patients, 48% (95% confidence interval, 27% to 69%) had a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to CARBO/VP; eight had PD. Among the subgroup of 15 assessable patients with medulloblastoma, 53% had a CR or PR (95% confidence interval, 27% to 79%) and five PD. The toxicity of CARBO/VP was predominantly hematologic; although grade IV neutropenia was common, only five episodes of febrile neutropenia occurred. Only thrombocytopenia was a more common toxicity than in other reported chemotherapy regimens; ototoxicity was less common than in cisplatin (CDDP) regimens. CONCLUSION: The responses and survival associated with neoadjuvant CARBO/VP are similar to those with CDDP-containing and other neoadjuvant drug regimens. Although the rate of progression with this regimen may be higher than with similar CDDP-containing regimens, the numbers of patients in other published studies of these agents are too small to detect meaningful statistical differences. Future studies must balance the apparently comparable efficacy of CARBO and CDDP with their differing toxicities.

Title:A thoracic spine testbed for the comparative biomechanical evaluation of spinal instrumentations.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Drewry TD', 'Sherman MC']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:This study focuses on the design, materials selection, and fabrication of a human thoracic spine (T-3 to T-12) mechanical analog testbed and an examination of its suitability for use in the comparative evaluation of biomechanical characteristics of spinal instrumentations. In this case, two constructs involving the Texas Scottish Rite Hospital (TSRH) system (namely, a specially assembled unilateral rod and the standard dual rod scoliosis arrangements) were compared. It was found that there is no statistically significant difference between the direct axial compressive stiffnesses of the constructs using these arrangements. In addition, the von Mises stresses at three selected locations on one of the vertical rods constituting the instrumentation showed statistically significant decreases when the standard dual-rod construct was used compared to the case when the unilateral-rod construct was used. It was found that the relative change in stiffness between the constructs approximated that observed in previous cadaveric and animal studies. It is thus concluded that the testbed is suitable for the stated purpose.

Title:Contribution of calcium to isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in the isolated perfused rabbit heart.
Authors:['Schwartz DD', 'Williams JL', 'Malik KU']
Affiliation:Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163.
Abstract:The present study was performed to investigate the contribution of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and calcium to isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis in the isolated rabbit heart perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer according to the method of Langendorff. Isoproterenol (0.05-1.5 nmol) increased glycerol output, left ventricular dP/dtmax, and heart rate but decreased coronary perfusion pressure. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (50 microM) failed to alter the basal or isoproterenol-induced increase in glycerol output, whereas cilostamide (5 microM) enhanced basal and inhibited isoproterenol-stimulated glycerol output. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with (phenylisopropyl)adenosine reduced isoproterenol-stimulated mechanical parameters but had no effect on basal or isoproterenol-stimulated glycerol output, whereas the cAMP analogue 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP did not increase glycerol output but produced changes in mechanical parameters similar to isoproterenol. Decreasing perfusion fluid calcium concentration from 1.2 to 0.5 mM or infusion of the calcium channel antagonist diltiazem (23 microM) abolished the increase in glycerol output in response to isoproterenol. Activation of adenylyl cyclase with forskolin increased glycerol output, but the increase was abolished by reducing perfusion fluid calcium concentration or by diltiazem. These data suggest that, in the rabbit heart, isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis appears to be mediated predominantly by calcium as a secondary metabolic response provided by the increase in mechanical activity.

Title:Characterization of HIV infection and seroconversion by a stochastic model of the HIV epidemic.
Authors:['Tan WY', 'Lee SR', 'Tang SC']
Affiliation:Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Memphis, Tennessee.
Abstract:In this paper we use a stochastic model for the HIV epidemic in homosexual populations to characterize the HIV infection and seroconversion. Using computer generated data, we compare the fitting of infection distributions and of seroconversion distributions by different parametric models as well as by nonparametric methods. The nonparametric methods include the Kaplan-Meier method, EMS method, Bacchetti's method, and the spline approximation. The parametric models include most of the models which have been used in the literature. The comparison criteria are the chi-square statistic, the AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and the residual sums of squares. The numerical results suggest that for the proportional mixing pattern, the EMS method, the spline method, Bacchetti's method, and the generalized log-logistic distributions with three and with four parameters provide better fitting for the infection and the seroconversion distributions in most cases. For the restricted mixing patterns, the EMS method, the spline method, Bacchetti's method, and some mixtures of distributions provide close fitting to the infection and the seroconversion distributions.

Title:Sleep compression and sleep education for older insomniacs: self-help versus therapist guidance.
Authors:['Riedel BW', 'Lichstein KL', 'Dwyer WO']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:A treatment package consisting of a bed-time restriction strategy and education was administered to 50 insomniacs and 50 noninsomniacs 60 years or older. Half of the insomniacs and noninsomniacs received treatment through a self-help video only, whereas the remaining treated participants received therapist guidance to supplement the video. A waiting-list control group of 25 senior insomniacs was also included. Sleep knowledge was equivalent for senior insomniacs and noninsomniacs. The self-help insomniac group exhibited improvement on multiple sleep variables, but the addition of therapist guidance appeared to enhance treatment outcome for sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, and sleep satisfaction. Control participants also improved across time but were generally outperformed by treated insomniacs.

Abstract:This experiment examined the metabolic effects of smoking during rest and light activity under naturalistic conditions. Thirty-nine male subjects first completed a submaximal graded exercise treadmill test to standardize activity level. Then 3 groups of subjects--smokers smoking (SS), smokers not smoking (SNS), and nonsmokers (NS)--were exposed to 3 stages of rest or 3 stages of light activity with order of rest or activity randomly determined over 2 different days. Energy expenditure was monitored continuously during these sessions. Significant increases in smokers' energy expenditure were observed during light activity when compared with smokers not smoking and nonsmokers. No differences were identified among groups at rest. These findings strengthen the conclusion that smoking or its components contribute to metabolic changes during typical levels of daily activity and suggest a mechanism for the frequently observed relationship between smoking status and body weight.

Title:The abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a shortened version of the Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, to be called the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, or APHAB. DESIGN: The Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (PHAB) is a 66-item self-assessment, disability-based inventory that can be used to document the outcome of a hearing aid fitting, to compare several fittings, or to evaluate the same fitting over time. Data from 128 completed PHABs were used to select items for the Abbreviated PHAB. All subjects were elderly hearing-impaired who wore conventional analog hearing aids. Statistics of score distributions and psychometric properties of each of the APHAB subscales were determined. Data from 27 similar subjects were used to examine the test-retest properties of the instrument. Finally, equal-percentile profiles were generated for unaided, aided and benefit scores obtained from successful wearers of linear hearing aids. RESULTS: The APHAB uses a subset of 24 of the 66 items from the PHAB, scored in four 6-item subscales. Three of the subscales, Ease of Communication, Reverberation, and Background Noise address speech understanding in various everyday environments. The fourth subscale, Aversiveness of Sounds, quantifies negative reactions to environmental sounds. The APHAB typically requires 10 minutes or less to complete, and it produces scores for unaided and aided performance as well as hearing aid benefit. Test-retest correlation coefficients were found to be moderate to high and similar to those reported in the literature for other scales of similar content and length. Critical differences for each subscale taken individually were judged to be fairly large, however, smaller differences between two tests from the same individual can be significant if the three speech communication subscales are considered jointly. CONCLUSIONS: The APHAB is a potentially valuable clinical instrument. It can be useful for quantifying the disability associated with a hearing loss and the reduction of disability that is achieved with a hearing aid.

Title:Effect of methylene blue on the fracture toughness of acrylic bone cement.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:It has been advocated that the use of contrast acrylic bone cement (namely, a cement in which a suitable additive is included) for the fixation of a cemented arthroplasty will facilitate its revision (should this be necessary). It is useful, therefore, to determine the extent to which each of the relevant mechanical properties of the cement is affected by the presence of such an additive. It is shown, in the present work, that the addition of one contrast agent (an aqueous methylene blue solution) to a cement has no statistically significant effect on its mode-I plane-strain fracture toughness. This strengthens the case for the use of contrast cement for the aforementioned application.

Title:Characterization of adhesion of non-exogenously stimulated and resting platelets in normal plasma to fibrinogen and its fragments.
Authors:['Gartner TK', 'Amrani DL', 'Derrick JM']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Platelet adhesion to various forms of fibrinogen was studied using platelets in plasma and washed platelets. The study was designed to determine if platelets prepared with minimal handling in plasma at physiological pH containing normal levels of Ca2+ have different requirements for adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen than do washed platelets tested in the absence of plasma. Exposure of platelets to citrate and low pH did not seem to affect the requirements of washed platelets for adhesion to fibrinogen. Nonetheless, behavioural differences between these two types of platelets were seen. Surprisingly, in the absence of exogenous activation normal platelets in plasma behaved qualitatively as stimulated washed platelets. That is, both types of platelets adhered to all forms of fibrinogen which possessed at least one gamma-chain carboxyl terminal platelet binding site. Platelets in plasma treated with prostaglandin E1 (resting platelets) adhered only to forms of fibrinogen which contained two gamma-chain platelet binding sites. These observations also demonstrate that the fibrinogen alpha-chain arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-phenylalanine and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine sequences are not necessary or sufficient to mediate the adhesion of resting or stimulated platelets in plasma to fibrinogen. The presence of endogenous adenosine diphosphate appears to account, at least in part, for the ability of normal platelets in plasma to adhere to forms of fibrinogen which have only one gamma-chain platelet binding site.

Affiliation:University of Memphis, Department of Psychology, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:The aim of this work was to assess the accuracy of physicians' subjective assessments of obesity status. The subjects were participants in The Second National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES II) Survey. The physicians' subjective judgments of obesity were compared to BMI, an objective measure of actual body mass. Subjects with a body mass index (BMI = weight in kg/(height in cm/100)2) less than or equal to 27.5 were classified as normal weight and those with a BMI greater than or equal to 30.4 were considered to be obese. Physicians were accurate in their diagnosis of the normal weight group with only 4.03% being misdiagnosed as obese. However, 12.6% of the obese group was misdiagnosed as normal weight. The odds of an incorrect normal weight diagnosis increased with age. Similarly, as the fat distribution ratio increased, i.e., a more central pattern, the odds of being actually obese but incorrectly diagnosed as normal weight increased. Men were more likely than women to be incorrectly diagnosed as normal weight. Non-Caucasian normal weight persons appear to have been diagnosed more stringently than Caucasians as they were more likely to be misdiagnosed as obese regardless of their gender. There appear to be several variables affecting the physicians' subjective assessment of obesity status in this data set.

Title:Interactions between chronic haloperidol treatment and cocaine in rats: an animal model of intermittent cocaine use in neuroleptic treated populations.
Authors:['LeDuc PA', 'Mittleman G']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:This experiment investigated the possibility that rats maintained on chronic haloperidol treatment would show increased behavioral responsiveness to cocaine, similar to that observed in human stimulant abusers who are chronically treated with neuroleptics. Thus, the effects on locomotion and stereotyped behavior of intermittent injections of cocaine were investigated in female rats receiving chronic haloperidol treatment. Daily injections of haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg, IP) or vehicle were administered for 6, 12 or 18 days prior to the start of testing with cocaine and were then continued throughout cocaine testing. All rats received four doses of cocaine (0.0, 3.0, 7.5, or 15.0 mg/kg, IP) in random order with an intervening vehicle day between successive drug days. The four dose sequence of cocaine was repeated a total of four times. Initial cocaine administration produced dose dependent increases in locomotion and stereotyped behavior. When the sequence of cocaine doses was repeated, differences among treatment groups emerged. Groups treated with haloperidol exhibited heightened locomotion in response to cocaine and with repeated injections, showed a higher rate of behavioral sensitization than control animals. These differences in the behavioral response to cocaine were maintained for at least 2 months following termination of daily haloperidol treatment. In order to examine the mechanisms underlying this heightened responsiveness to cocaine, apomorphine-induced locomotion (dose range, 0-250 micrograms/kg, SC) was determined. Regardless of dose, rats treated with haloperidol showed different temporal patterns of locomotion in response to apomorphine suggesting that the increased response to cocaine was related to changes in dopaminergic receptor sensitivity.

Title:Complementary peptides that interfere with platelet aggregation and adherence.
Authors:['Gartner TK', 'Taylor DB', 'Derrick J']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:This article describes the application of the molecular recognition hypothesis to the critically important process of fibrinogen binding to platelets, a process that is the subject of extensive and intensive basic and clinical research. The objectives of the studies summarized below were to design, synthesize, and characterize peptides that can inhibit the binding of fibrinogen and related ligands to human platelets and thereby prevent platelet aggregation, adhesion, and clot retraction. The purpose of doing this work was twofold: first, to determine whether the molecular recognition hypothesis could serve as a useful rationale for the design of peptides that can specifically inhibit the binding of fibrinogen and related ligands to platelets; and second, to use these peptides to try to learn where fibrinogen binds to the platelet fibrinogen receptor. It was hoped that the results obtained not only would provide insight into platelet function but also might provide a rationale for the design of a clinically useful anti-thrombotic agent. Although our studies are not complete, they have resulted in the design of a variety of peptides that can inhibit platelet aggregation, adhesion, and clot retraction as a consequence of specifically inhibiting the binding of fibrinogen and related ligands to the platelet fibrinogen receptor. Although none of these peptides appears to be ligand specific, one or two of them may be specific for platelets.

Title:A parametric finite element analysis study of the stresses in an endosseous implant.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152.
Abstract:The finite element analysis method was used to obtain the stresses in the various structures in an endosseous implant-contiguous bone construct using a two-dimensional idealization. The results were obtained as a function of the materials used for the post and the crown of the implant. It is shown that these stresses are critically dependent on the post material (for a given crown material). The clinical significance of the results is discussed.

Title:Constructing inferences during narrative text comprehension.
Authors:['Graesser AC', 'Singer M', 'Trabasso T']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis.
Abstract:The authors describe a constructionist theory that accounts for the knowledge-based inferences that are constructed when readers comprehend narrative text. Readers potentially generate a rich variety of inferences when they construct a referential situation model of what the text is about. The proposed constructionist theory specifies that some, but not all, of this information is constructed under most conditions of comprehension. The distinctive assumptions of the constructionist theory embrace a principle of search (or effort) after meaning. According to this principle, readers attempt to construct a meaning representation that addresses the reader's goals, that is coherent at both local and global levels, and that explains why actions, events, and states are mentioned in the text. This study reviews empirical evidence that addresses this theory and contrasts it with alternative theoretical frameworks.

Title:Manipulation of ion-pairing reagents for reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic separation of phosphorylated opioid peptides from their non-phosphorylated analogues.
Authors:['Dass C', 'Mahalakshmi P', 'Grandberry D']
Affiliation:Charles B. Stout Neuroscience Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, University of Tennessee at Memphis 38163.
Abstract:The use of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for the separation of a mixture of 14 phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated enkephalins is described. The influence of two homologous series of hydrophobic ion-pairing reagents, consisting of perfluorinated carboxylic (trifluoroacetic, pentafluoropropionic and hexafluorobutyric) acids and sodium salts of sulfonic (butane-, hexane- and heptane-) acids, on the retention of enkephalin peptides was investigated. The incorporation of the phosphate group reduces retention time in proportion with the resulting change in hydrophobicity of the peptide. All peptides exhibit increase in retention time with increase in the counter ion hydrophobicity. The increase is proportional to the number of positively charged groups present in a peptide. Phosphopeptides show small increases in retention times than their corresponding non-phospho derivatives. The near-neighbor effect of the Tyr-O-phosphate group is responsible for suppression of the ion-pairing interaction of the mobile phase counter ions with the positively charged terminal amino group of enkephalins.

Abstract:This review provides a quantitative integration of research on the effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological treatments for nocturnal enuresis. With the use of experiments that compared treatments with either no treatment or another form of treatment, this article assesses (a) the overall effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological treatments, (b) the relative effectiveness of specific types of treatments, and (c) moderators of treatment effectiveness including investigator allegiance. Findings from the review confirm that enuretic children benefit substantially from treatment. However, more children improve from psychological than from pharmacological interventions. Moreover, psychological treatments involving a urine alarm are most likely to yield benefits that are maintained once treatment has ended.

Title:Polydipsia and dopamine: behavioral effects of dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agonists and antagonists.
Authors:['Mittleman G', 'Rosner AL', 'Schaub CL']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:Substantial evidence implicates dopaminergic neural systems in the occurrence of polydipsia in both animals and humans. Two experiments were conducted in order to specify the behavioral mechanisms whereby manipulation of dopaminergic neural transmission can affect scheduled-induced polydipsia (SIP). The role of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors was investigated by comparing the behavioral effects of dopamine D1 agonists (SKF 38393 and SKF 82958) and antagonists (SCH 23390 and SKF 83566) to those of a dopamine D2 agonist (quinpirole) and antagonist (haloperidol) by using an animal model of excessive water consumption, drinking evoked in the SIP paradigm. Additionally, the behavioral effects of these relatively specific compounds were compared to those of the indirect agonist d-amphetamine sulfate and the nondopaminergic drug, diazepam. All of the drugs produced dose-related decreases in SIP. With the exception of SKF 38393 and SCH 23390, the decreased drinking appeared to be a behaviorally nonspecific drug effect in that changes in activity consistently preceded or accompanied reductions in water consumption. Some of the drugs tested, including quinpirole, haloperidol and SKF 83566, also produced changes in behavior consistent with decreased hunger, which may have also contributed to the reductions in SIP. These results are generally suggestive that dopamine neural systems are involved mainly in the motor or performance aspects of established SIP and that disruptions in established SIP produced by dopamine agonists or antagonists may result from a change in the balance of activation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. These results may be relevant to understanding the factors influencing polydipsia in humans.

Title:Relationship between in-situ distortion and hearing aid benefit.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Taylor IM']
Affiliation:Memphis Speech and Hearing Center, University of Memphis, Tennessee.
Abstract:In-situ hearing aid distortion is defined as distortion measured in the ear canal with stimulus inputs and hearing aid settings that are similar to those the hearing aid wearer will experience in daily life. This preliminary study examined possible relationships between in-situ distortion and benefit for appropriately fitted contemporary hearing aids. Simulated in-situ distortion was determined for 97 hearing aid fittings, divided among three typical listening environments: living room, classroom lecture, and social event. Measures included intermodulation, harmonic, and transient distortion. Overall results of between- and within-subject analyses of data suggested that there was a significant relationship between distortion and benefit in both reverberant and noisy environments similar to a classroom lecture and a social event, respectively. This outcome was seen despite the fact that distortion was quite low in absolute terms. Analyses also suggested that in-situ harmonic distortion was most closely related to benefit and that the other types of distortion measured did not make additional contributions to benefit prediction. We propose that measurements of in-situ harmonic distortion might be a valuable addition to hearing aid evaluations.

Abstract:The thrust of the present work is the demonstration of the feasibility of using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection and quantification of a monoclonal antibody human serum. The antibodies used, 7E3 and D3GP3, have been proposed as platelet receptor blockers, being directed specifically against the platelet membrane receptors (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) and thus of significance in the management of patients at a very hgih risk of thrombotic occlusion. It is shown that 7E3 is more easily adsorbed than D3GP3 and hence has a higher potential for the stated application.

Title:Cloning, sequencing, and expression of a fibronectin/fibrinogen-binding protein from group A streptococci.
Authors:['Courtney HS', 'Li Y', 'Dale JB', 'Hasty DL']
Affiliation:Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis, Tennessee 38104.
Abstract:Lipoteichoic acid and several streptococcal proteins have been reported to bind fibronectin (Fn) or fibrinogen (Fgn), which may serve as host receptors. We searched for such proteins by screening a library of genes from M type 5 group A streptococci cloned into Escherichia coli. Lysates of clones were probed with biotinylated Fn and biotinylated Fgn. One clone expressed a 54-kDa protein that reacted with Fn and Fgn. The protein, termed FBP54, was purified and used to immunize rabbits. Anti-FBP54 serum reacted with purified, recombinant FBP54 and with a protein of similar electrophoretic mobility in extracts of M type 5, 6, and 24 streptococci. Anti-FBP54 serum also reacted with 5 of 15 strains of intact, live streptococci, suggesting that FBP54 may be a surface antigen. Southern blot analysis confirmed that the gene is found in group A streptococci but not in Staphylococcus aureus or E. coli. The cloned gene was sequenced and contained an open reading frame encoding a protein with a calculated molecular weight of 54,186. Partial amino acid sequencing of purified FBP54 confirmed that this open reading frame encoded the protein. As determined by utilizing fusion proteins containing truncated forms of FBP54, the primary Fn/Fgn-binding domain appears to be contained in residues 1 to 89. These data suggest that FBP54 may be a surface protein of streptococci that reacts with both Fn and Fgn and therefore may participate in the adhesion of group A streptococci to host cells.

Authors:['Coons LB', 'Lessman CA', 'Ward MW', 'Berg RH', 'Lamoreaux WJ']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Type III acini from feeding female Dermacentor variabilis varied in size during in vitro and in vivo fluid production. As the type III acinus enlarged, its lumen enlarged and the adlumenal cell became thinner. As the acinus contracted, its lumen became smaller while the adlumenal cell became wider. Actin was demonstrated in salivary glands using an immunoblot technique. Actin was localized in the adlumenal cells of type III acini with fluorescent microscopy using rhodamine-phalloidin and with electron microscopy using heavy meromyosin to decorate actin filaments. Pre-treatment of salivary glands with cytochalasin D abolished fluorescence in adlumenal cells subsequently treated with rhodamine-phalloidin. These results support the hypothesis that the adlumenal cell in type III acini functions as a myoepithelial cell.

Abstract:Isolated salivary glands from female Dermacentor variabilis (Say) were pre-treated with either cytochalasin D or nocodazol, followed by stimulation with dopamine. Glands pre-treated with 1 microM-cytochalasin D did not secrete fluid; pre-treatment with 1 nM-cytochalasin D did not significantly reduce fluid secretion. Glands pre-treated with 1 microM-nocodazol had a significant reduction in fluid secretion (P = 0.003); 1 nM-nocodazol did not significantly affect fluid secretion. Ligation of the main salivary duct and pre-treatment with 1 microM-cytochalasin D significantly increased gland weight compared to the dopamine stimulated controls (P = 0.0412). Cytochalasin D-treated type III acini had a significantly larger mean diameter compared to the dopamine control (P = 0.0047). Glands treated with 1 mM-verapamil plus 10 microM-dopamine exhibited a significant decrease in fluid secretion (P = 0.017), and when ligated, had a significantly decreased weight compared to the controls (P = 0.0028).

Title:Taxol-induced assembly of brain and testis tubulins, and ovarian follicle tubulin dynamics in the frog (genus Rana), in vitro.
Authors:['Lessman CA']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:1. Tubulins from brain and testes of the frog (genus Rana) were purified by taxol and cyclic assembly-disassembly. 2. Attempts to purify ovarian tubulins by this same method were unsuccessful. 3. Oocyte fractions isolated in microtubule-stabilizing detergent buffer were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies to tubulins. 4. In the fully-grown ovarian follicle (diameter approx. 1.7 mm), the majority of tubulin was present in the supernatant fraction. 5. Tubulin was routinely detected in the medium speed (16,000 g) prophase I oocyte pellet. 6. Nocodazole treatment of ovarian follicles in vitro reduced the pelletable tubulin detected, while taxol increased tubulin in the pellet and decreased the supernatant tubulin. 7. These results indicate that taxol is useful in the purification of brain and testes tubulin from Rana tissue; while oocyte tubulin appears to respond to taxol in vivo, another method will be required for in vitro assembly and purification of ovarian tubulin.

Title:The role of D1 and D2 receptors in the heightened locomotion induced by direct and indirect dopamine agonists in rats with hippocampal damage: an animal analogue of schizophrenia.
Authors:['Mittleman G', 'LeDuc PA', 'Whishaw IQ']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Rats with limbic system damage display increases in responsivity to sensory stimulation and changes in the sensitivity to amphetamine, suggesting that their condition may parallel that of human schizophrenia. This experiment examined locomotion and stereotyped behavior in mature, male rats that had received aspirative lesions of the hippocampus, control lesions of the overlying parietal cortex, or were unoperated controls. Locomotion, measured as photocell beam breaks, was recorded during 2- or 3-h test sessions. Behavioral stereotypy was simultaneously rated. Hippocampal lesioned rats exhibited a selective enhancement in locomotion following D-amphetamine (0.0-5.6 mg/kg) when compared to animals in the control groups. Similar results were observed following injections of apomorphine (0.0-0.25 mg/kg), a mixed D1 and D2 agonist. In order to determine if D1 or D2 receptors were involved in this increased locomotion, the D1 agonist SKF 38393 (0.0-15 mg/kg) and the D2 agonist quinpirole (0.0-0.5 mg/kg) were tested alone and in combination. Hippocampal-ablated rats showed significantly increased locomotion only in response to quinpirole, suggesting that these lesion-induced increases were largely mediated by D2 receptors. When both drugs were administered together, SKF 38393 further enhanced the locomotor stimulating effects of quinpirole in hippocampal lesioned rats, indicating a synergistic interaction between D1 and D2 receptors in the modulation of locomotion. These findings provide further evidence of hippocampal modulation of locomotion and suggest that dopaminergic mechanisms in the nucleus accumbens, probably involving changes in receptor sensitivity, are involved. The results are discussed in relation to the functional roles of the nucleus accumbens and in terms of their implications for mental diseases including schizophrenia.

Title:Opsonic effect of the alternative complement pathway on channel catfish peripheral blood phagocytes.
Authors:['Jenkins JA', 'Ourth DD']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:This study determined the effect of the alternative complement pathway (ACP) on neutrophil and monocyte phagocytes from peripheral blood of channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus. Fluorescent-labeled latex microspheres, Edwardsiella ictaluri and Escherichia coli were used to quantify phagocytic attachment and ingestion. Activation of the ACP enhanced the attachment of bacteria and microspheres to neutrophils and monocytes. Activation of the ACP by serum opsonization of Escherichia coli increased its ingestion by neutrophils in comparison with Edwardsiella ictaluri and microspheres. Inactivation of the ACP and C3b diminished attachment by neutrophils and monocytes, and ingestion by neutrophils of microspheres and bacteria. Ingestion by monocytes was not affected by activation of the ACP. In the present study, we found that the ACP functions in opsonophagocytosis in catfish and that ingestion by neutrophils was especially enhanced.

Title:Posttranslational modifications and assembly characteristics of goldfish tubulin.
Authors:['Lessman CA', 'Zhang J', 'MacRae TH']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Cell-free extracts from goldfish brain, ovarian follicles, testes and the cell line, ATCC CCL-71, were analyzed for posttranslationally modified tubulins. All samples, with the exception of that from brain where the reverse was true, contained more tyrosinated than detyrosinated alpha-tubulin. Additionally, extracts from brain and testes exhibited acetylated alpha-tubulin whereas this isoform was not visualized on blots of cell-free preparations from follicles and CCL-71 cells. Assembly of brain and ovary tubulin was induced with taxol. Brain tubulin, partially purified through three cycles of assembly/disassembly was associated with a variety of putative microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), most of which had a high molecular mass. There were very few cold stable microtubules in brain preparations whereas, for ovary, purification of tubulin was hampered by significant losses of cold stable polymer. Comparison of brain and ovary showed there was no correlation between the extent of alpha-tubulin detyrosination or acetylation and cold stability of microtubules. Moreover, cycled tubulin from ovary contained acetylated tubulin even though this was not observed on blots of cell-free extracts from ovary or from follicles. Cultured goldfish cells contained extensive arrays of microtubules, many of which originated from discrete organizing centers. The results reveal the widespread distribution of posttranslationally modified tubulins in goldfish tissues, the differing assembly/disassembly characteristics of tubulin from brain versus ovary, and the presence of putative neural MAPs, mostly with a high molecular mass.

Abstract:The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of botulinum toxin injection on measures of depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints in patients diagnosed as having spasmodic dysphonia. Patients were asked to complete preinjection questionnaires with self-ratings of depression, state and trait anxiety, and somatic complaints. Approximately 1 week and 2 months following injection, patients were again asked to complete the questionnaires. The spasmodic dysphonic subjects exhibited significantly elevated mean levels of depression and anxiety. These levels were significantly reduced approximately 1 week after injection. Two months later, depression and anxiety measures did not change significantly from their 1-week postinjection values. The results suggest that patients with spasmodic dysphonia who demonstrate significantly elevated measures of depression and anxiety show a reduction in those measures following treatment with botulinum toxin.

Title:On the evaluation of a new generation of hearing aids.
Authors:['Cox RM']
Affiliation:Memphis State University, TN 38112.
Abstract:Hearing aids with new technological features offer the promise of novel speech-processing and loudness-control capabilities. Full exploitation and assessment of these capabilities will call for the acceptance of fitting and evaluation strategies different from those currently used for traditional linear hearing aids. Until an appropriate set of procedures comes into relatively widespread use, it will be difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the desirability and effectiveness of the new options in amplification systems. This paper reviews some of the issues that should be considered as new evaluation procedures are explored.

Title:Isolation and characterization of the reaction product of 4-diazobenzenesulfonic acid and gamma-carboxyglutamic acid: modification of the assay for measurement of beta-carboxyaspartic acid.
Authors:['Nishimoto SK', 'Zhao J', 'Dass C']
Affiliation:Department of Biochemistry, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163.
Abstract:gamma-Carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-containing proteins are extracellular proteins with enhanced cation or mineral-binding properties. Discovery of new Gla-containing proteins is facilitated by methods that decrease the number of steps and time involved in assaying for Gla. Reaction of 4-diazobenzenesulfonic acid (DBS) and Gla or Gla-containing proteins produces an intensely red-colored product. This method has been used to identify Gla-containing proteins in crude extracts of proteins. The reaction product of Gla and DBS has been purified by reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by uv-visible spectroscopy and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS). The red-colored product exhibits an absorption maximum at 530 nm. The ESI-MS data of the colored derivative of Gla are consistent with replacement of the two gamma-carboxyl groups in Gla with two DBS groups. DBS also reacts with another malonic acid derivative, beta-carboxyaspartic acid (Asa). The optimum conditions for colorimetric assay of Asa were established, and the potential of this reaction as an assay for Asa and Asa-containing proteins was studied.

Abstract:The mass spectral behavior of a set of eight 2- and 10-disubstituted phenoxazines putatively possessing anticancer drug enhancer properties was investigated. Both electron ionization (EI) and keV-ion beam bombardment (liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry, LSIMS) were used. As expected, EI led to extensive fragmentation to produce structurally characteristics ions. Except in one example, the molecular ions were reasonably abundant. Two different liquid matrices--sulfolane and 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol--were used to obtain LSIMS data. The use of the latter produced more stable molecular ions. Ion beam bombardment also produced several structure-specific fragments. A unique feature of the LSI spectra obtained using either of the above matrices is production of both M+. and [M + H]+ ions, with the former being more abundant in most cases. Adduct formation with the liquid matrices was also observed for many compounds.

Title:Preschoolers' evaluations of physical disabilities: a consideration of attitudes and behavior.
Authors:['Cohen R', 'Nabors LA', 'Pierce KA']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, Tennessee 38152.
Abstract:Assessed preschoolers' attitudes about orthopedically handicapped individuals with a standard picture-ranking task. Children generally exhibited a functionally related preference for nonhandicapped individuals. One month later, the same children were videotaped reading and playing basketball with a female adult in a wheelchair or in a chair. Preferences for a normal play partner during reading or during sports on the picture-ranking task did not relate to frequency of social interactions. Liking preference for a normal play partner, in conjunction with gender of the child, predicted frequency of social interactions during both tasks regardless of examiner's handicap status. Thus, the adoption of a negative bias had a general influence; any potential behavioral biases, as reflective of preference biases, were undifferentiated and unfocused in these preschoolers.

Title:Induction of cecropin-like and attacin-like antibacterial but not antiviral activity in Heliothis virescens larvae.
Authors:['Ourth DD', 'Lockey TD', 'Renis HE']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, TN 38152.
Abstract:Inducible cecropin-like and attacin-like proteins were isolated from immune hemolymph obtained from vaccinated Heliothis virescens larvae. The attacin-like protein had a molecular weight of approximately 25,000 daltons and was not dialyzable. The cecropin-like peptide had an estimated molecular weight of 6,000-7,000 daltons and was dialyzable, heat-stable and sensitive to trypsin digestion. The cecropin-like peptide showed bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae, and the attacin-like protein showed bactericidal activity against E. coli. The immune hemolymph was bactericidal against E. coli, E. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ultrastructural cell envelope damage to E. coli, produced by the immune hemolymph, was observed by scanning electron microscopy. No antiviral activity by the inducible cecropin-like and attacin-like proteins was detected against herpes simplex virus-1 and the vesicular stomatitis virus.

Abstract:The mode-I plane-strain fracture toughness values of eight posterior restorative composite materials were determined using straight-sided chevron-notch short-rod specimens and a special loading module. These results, together with the values of the modulus of elasticity, modulus of resilience, and flexural strength of these materials (as given in a paper by a previous worker) were used in a detailed correlational exercise, with the values of the clinical wear of restorations made from these materials (as given in the aforementioned paper) being the dependent variable. It was found that clinical wear may best be predicted using values of all four aforementioned mechanical properties.

Title:Prediction of hearing aid benefit: the role of preferred listening levels.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:The listening level chosen by a hearing aid wearer for receiving amplified speech in noise has a substantial impact on the benefit that the hearing aid can provide. Chosen listening levels determine (1) the extent to which audibility of speech cues is improved by amplification, (2) the in situ distortion generated by the hearing aid, and sometimes (3) the auditory resolution abilities available to the hearing-impaired listener. All of these variables have been shown to affect hearing aid benefit. Thus, to predict benefit in any particular listening environment, the listening level that the wearer would choose in that setting must be known with some precision. This paper reports two studies of chosen, or preferred, listening levels. We present evidence to show that preferred listening levels vary with changes in the listening environment, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio is favorable. We describe a method for predicting preferred listening level changes in some environments that differ in talker levels and/or signal-to-noise ratios.

Affiliation:Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:Key aspects of a successful recruitment program to attract bright, talented students to this dynamic profession are (a) providing informative and attractive printed materials about the professions and the program, (b) establishing key personnel to provide personal contact with each student applicant, (c) specifying deadlines for application submission and decisions, (d) providing efficient feedback, (e) maintaining consistent contact with students prior to matriculation, and (f) offering several social and academic activities to orient new students. Although concepts important to retention are not included here, they are similarly important and should be considered carefully. Given the cyclical nature of student enrollment in the professions, a program's emphasis on recruitment may change. However, in order to keep student enrollment levels constant, consistent recruitment is necessary.

Title:Lack of involvement of 4-hydroxynorephedrine in phenylpropanolamine-induced anorexia in rats.
Authors:['Rushing PA', 'Mittleman G']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:The anorexic effects of phenylpropanolamine (PPA) appear to be qualitatively different in humans and rats. One factor that may account for these differences is that PPA is excreted essentially unchanged in humans, while nearly 30% is metabolized into 4-hydroxynorephedrine (4-OHN) in rats. To investigate the contribution of 4-OHN to the anorexic properties of PPA, this experiment compared the effects of equal doses (0.0-20.0 mg/kg, IP) of both drugs on eating and drinking during restricted feeding trials in the same group of food-deprived, female rats. Both 15.0 and 20.0 mg/kg of PPA significantly decreased eating when compared to saline vehicle, while 5.0-20.0 mg/kg of the drug reduced prandial drinking. In comparison, only the highest dose of 4-OHN (20.0 mg/kg) significantly suppressed food and water intake. When the percentage of reduction produced by corresponding doses of the two drugs was compared, PPA proved to be more than twice as potent as 4-OHN. It is concluded that, at the doses used, 4-OHN is unlikely to significantly contribute to reductions in deprivation-induced eating produced by the acute administration of PPA.

Title:Prevalence of uveitis: a retrospective study.
Authors:['Simmons CA', 'Mathews D']
Affiliation:Omni Eye Service, Memphis, TN 38117.
Abstract:BACKGROUND: Uveitis is commonly seen in optometric practice, and anterior uveitis accounts for more than 75% of all uveitis. Uveitis may be the initial manifestation of an associated systemic disease process; and, with proper testing and diagnosis, the patient's ocular and systemic condition may be more effectively treated. METHODS: Retrospectively, 194 charts from a referral practice with a general diagnosis of uveitis, retinitis, or chorioretinal scar were reviewed to determine medical history, clinical findings, tests performed, and specific diagnoses obtained. RESULTS: The majority of cases, 87.6%, were anterior uveitis with more than half, 54.7%, presenting with undetermined etiology. Trauma was the cause of the next most common group of anterior uveitis patients, 21.8%, and accounted for 19.1% of all uveitis cases. Glaucomatocyclitic crisis was seen in 8 cases, 4.1%, while there were 7 patients with sarcoid disease, and 5 with ankylosing spondylitis or systemic lupus erythematosus. Posterior uveitis was the principle finding in 12.4% of cases with ocular histoplasmosis being most common. There were 4 cases of toxoplasmosis and 3 cases of pars planitis. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of laboratory testing proved to be most valuable in the treatment and management of uveitis. Although there were fewer cases of pars planitis reported in our study in comparison to previous reports, the mix of cases of uveitis in our study was comparable to the work of others in the field. Accurate diagnosis of these cases is quite important since the treatment and prognosis for recovery is variable and different with its associated diseases.

Title:Characterization of adhesion of "resting" and stimulated platelets to fibrinogen and its fragments.

Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Adhesion of resting and stimulated platelets to immobilized fibrinogen (Fg) was characterized using various forms of Fg, receptor peptide mimics, and antibodies to glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa and Fg. Resting platelets adhered to Fg, but to less than half the extent of the same platelets stimulated with epinephrine/ADP. The adhesion of resting and stimulated platelets to Fg was inhibited by a receptor peptide mimic (G13, a peptide corresponding to residues 300-312 of GPIIb), anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies, and a monoclonal antibody (4A5) against the carboxyl terminus of the gamma chain of Fg. The results presented here demonstrate that the alpha chain RGD platelet recognition sites are not required to mediate the adhesion of either stimulated or resting platelets to immobilized Fg. Although stimulated platelets can adhere extensively to monomeric Fg containing one functional gamma chain, resting platelets require bivalent Fg containing two functional gamma chains to mediate irreversible adhesion to Fg.

Title:Mass spectrometric analysis of opioid and tachykinin neuropeptides in non-secreting and ACTH-secreting human pituitary adenomas.

Abstract:In a study to test the hypothesis that defects in the metabolism of neuropeptides might be a contributing factor to human anterior pituitary tumor formation, the proenkephalin A, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and tachykinin systems, which produce methionine enkephalin (ME), beta-endorphin (BE), and substance P (SP), respectively, were measured in patients who had a wide variety of pituitary tumors. Mass spectrometry was used to optimize the level of molecular specificity of the ME and BE analytical measurements, and radioimmunoassay was used to measure SP-like immunoreactivity (SP-li). Compared to data obtained from pituitaries from post-mortem controls, the non-secreting tumors contained a significantly lower amount of the POMC neuropeptide, BE. The lower ME level was not significant. However, two adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-secreting tumors contained ME, BE, and SP-li amounts that were much higher than both the controls and nonsecreting tumors. These data suggest that a hypometabolism of the POMC precursor may be operating in non-secreting tumors, and that a hypermetabolism of the proenkephalin A, POMC, and tachykinin precursors may be operating in two ACTH-secreting tumors. These data demonstrate that mass spectrometry plays a critical role in the study of human pituitary tumors.

Title:Antiviral melanization reaction of Heliothis virescens hemolymph against DNA and RNA viruses in vitro.
Authors:['Ourth DD', 'Renis HE']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:1. Antiviral activity of Heliothis virescens larval hemolymph was determined using a cytotoxicity/virus inhibition test (TClD50) done in Vero cell tissue cultures. Excellent antiviral activity was found especially against herpes simplex viruses-1 and -2 and also against vesicular stomatitis, parainfluenza-3, coxsackie B3 and sindbis viruses. 2. Prolonged incubation of herpes simplex virus-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus with hemolymph was virucidal and greatly reduced infectivity of the two viruses in tissue culture. 3. Antiviral activity was produced by both normal and immune (vaccinated larvae) cell-free hemolymphs. 4. Antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus-1 could be generated in vitro with hemolymph phenoloxidase or mushroom tyrosinase using four different substrates including tyrosine. 5. Activation of the insect melanization reaction by phenoloxidase was necessary for antiviral activity to occur.

Title:Prediction of benefit from linear hearing aids in nonreverberant listening environments.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:Hearing aid benefit, defined in terms of improved speech intelligibility, was measured for 16 elderly hearing-impaired subjects. Twelve conditions were tested, simulating a range of daily situations from typical home environments to moderate-sized social gatherings, and assuming a small talker-listener distance (thus maintaining essentially nonreverberant listening conditions). Each subject was fitted with the same type of programmable hearing aid. The goals were to develop a model for the prediction of benefit based on hearing loss, listening environment, and amplification variables, and to assess the potential accuracy of the model. Two models were developed using multiple linear regression analyses. The prefitting model used data that would be available before a hearing aid fitting, that is, audiogram and listening environment data. This model, although potentially useful as a counseling tool, was relatively inaccurate. Six of the 16 subjects yielded benefit data that were consistently different from the model's predictions. The postfitting model used information that could be obtained during a hearing aid fitting about audibility changes resulting from amplification. This model produced more accurate, but still imperfect predictions of benefit. Benefit obtained by three subjects deviated substantially from the predictions of the postfitting model. It was concluded that a model producing fairly accurate benefit predictions must encompass additional variables beyond those considered here. Nevertheless, these models may be useful for prediction of typical benefit for potential hearing aid wearers.

Title:Effects of phenylpropanolamine on regulatory and nonregulatory ingestion in adult rats.
Authors:['Mittleman G', 'Rushing PA', 'Winders SE']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:This experiment examined the effects of phenylpropanolamine (0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0 mg/kg PPA) on regulatory (RG) and nonregulatory (NRG) eating and drinking in rats using a within-subjects design. Administration of PPA produced dose-dependent reductions in eating in animals deprived to 80-85% of baseline weight, and reduced drinking after 23.5-h of water deprivation. Nonregulatory eating, elicited by tail pinch in nondeprived animals, was similarly inhibited. Nonregulatory drinking was elicited in the schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) paradigm. Water consumption, locomotion, licking, lick efficiency (licks/ml water), and entries into the food magazine were simultaneously measured. At the lowest dose, only locomotion was significantly reduced. At 10.0 mg/kg, lick efficiency and entries into the food magazine were also significantly reduced, while all measured behaviors, including licking and water consumption, were decreased by the highest dose of PPA. The reduction in lick efficiency suggested a PPA-induced motor impairment in the capacity for licking. Considered together, these results indicated that the observed decreases in regulatory and nonregulatory eating and drinking could be at least partially accounted for by the drug's effects on behaviors contributing to ingestion, as well as apparent motor impairments in ingestive behavior at higher doses.

Title:Effects of phenylpropanolamine infusion and withdrawal on body weight and dietary composition in male and female rats.
Authors:['Rushing PA', 'Winders SE', 'Mittleman G']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, Memphis State University, TN 38152.
Abstract:Male and female rats with ad lib access to separate sources of carbohydrate, fat, and protein were implanted with minipumps providing one of three dosages (0.0, 40.0, or 80.0 mg/kg/day) of phenylpropanolamine (PPA) for 2 weeks. Body weight, macronutrient intake, and water consumption were measured daily before, during, and after PPA treatment. Phenylpropanolamine lowered body weight and caloric intake in males and females, and water consumption in females, but did not alter dietary composition in either sex. After PPA termination, caloric intake returned to control levels in both males and females. However, body weight returned to control levels in males only, while PPA-treated females continued to weigh less than controls. Phenylpropanolamine termination was associated with significant increases in water consumption and the percentage of total calories consumed from protein and reductions in the percentage of calories from carbohydrate in males. In contrast, water and macronutrient consumption was similar comparing PPA-treated females to controls after drug termination. These results suggest there are sex differences in the effects of PPA termination on water and macronutrient consumption that result in differential weight gain in males and females.

Abstract:In this paper we develop a stochastic model for the HIV epidemic in a homosexual population and use the model to characterize the HIV infection distribution and seroconversion distribution. Through computer-generated infection distributions and seroconversion distributions, we assess the effects of various risk factors on these distributions. The fitting of some data sets generated by computer suggests that the three-parameter generalized log-logistic distribution should be assumed as the infection distribution for the proposed stochastic model of HIV epidemics.

Title:Indices of frequency and temporal resolution as a function of level.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC']
Affiliation:Memphis State University, Tennessee.
Abstract:Several investigators have suggested that between-subject variations in hearing aid benefit may be related to between-subject variations in auditory resolution. Evaluation of this relationship is complicated by the need to assess resolution at several frequencies and levels in hearing-impaired listeners who may not tolerate lengthy test procedures. This paper reports data from normal-hearing listeners for abbreviated indices of frequency and temporal resolution. For a particular frequency-stimulus level combination, both indices may be derived from three pure-tone thresholds obtained with different masking stimuli. Norms are reported as a function of masker level for each index at four test frequencies. Changes in the indices as a function of masker level were consistent with expectations based on related studies by other investigators. Norms were obtained using a supra-aural earphone. Comparison of results from supra-aural and insert earphones suggested that low-frequency sound leakage substantially affected the norms for 500 Hz. Reliability of individual indices was good to excellent.

Abstract:We measured the interaural attenuation for click stimuli using insert earphones. Electrocochleographic thresholds were determined when clicks were presented both ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the recording ear. The interaural attenuation was calculated as the difference between ipsilateral and contralateral thresholds. Results from normal listeners showed that crossover occurred. Results agree with previous investigators who used a different approach. Results confirm that one may need to mask the nontest ear in clinical evoked potential testing even though insert earphones are used. Several approaches to the question of when to mask are proposed.

Abstract:Predicated on a postmodern epistemology, constructivist theories emphasize the proactive, self-organizing features of human knowing and their implications for psychotherapy. This article outlines the potential contributions of 4 clinical lineages sharing a constructivist philosophy--personal construct theory, structural--developmental cognitive therapy, narrative reconstruction, and constructivist family therapy--and briefly reviews emerging trends in psychotherapy research compatible with this perspective. Although current constructivist approaches confront problems as well as prospects, they represent a growing force within psychotherapy, contributing to the sophistication of psychological theory, the diversification of clinical research, and the extension of therapeutic technique.

Abstract:The mutagenicity of p-phenylenediamine and its derivatives was tested using Ames Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100. p-Phenylenediamine was weakly mutagenic to TA98 with metabolic activation. 2-Nitro-p-phenylenediamine was directly mutagenic to both strains, while 2-methyl-p-phenylenediamine required S9 mix. All the test compounds induced a dose-related increase in chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in the absence of the S9 mix. The mutagenicity and toxicity of these compounds did not correlate with their oxidation potentials, or any other tested physicochemical properties including the energy difference between the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied molecular orbital, ionization potential, and dipole moment.

Title:Patterns of symptomatic change in depressed patients in a private inpatient mood disorders program.
Authors:['Neimeyer RA', 'Baker KD', 'Haykal RF', 'Akiskal HS']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:This naturalistic study of 352 depressed patients admitted to a mood disorders program in a private psychiatric hospital demonstrated that, for the majority of patients, combining cognitive group therapy with ongoing supportive individual, psychoeducational, milieu, and pharmacological interventions resulted in rapid overall improvement and discharge within a few weeks. Improvement was manifested across cognitive and vegetative factor scores of the Beck Depression Inventory. However, patterns of symptom remission differed for subgroups defined by different lengths of stay. For example, patients hospitalized for 4 weeks showed good initial response, followed by a plateau in improvement, and, finally, continued response. These patients eventually reached the same level of functioning at discharge as did more rapidly responding patients with briefer stays. In contrast, a subset of patients (10% of the sample) hospitalized 5 weeks or more showed less overall improvement (especially in vegetative symptoms), plateauing at a moderately symptomatic level. These data suggest that in a minority of depressed individuals, continuing physiological disturbances may underlie dysthymia or residual depression. However, in contrast to the high rates (20-30%) of chronicity reported from tertiary care settings, these data indicate the relatively good initial treatment response of depressed patients admitted to a private psychiatric hospital.

Title:Mechanical properties of vacuum-mixed acrylic bone cement.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Austin GE']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The thrust of the present work was the experimental determination of the uniaxial static compressive and fully reversed tension-compression fatigue properties of CMW 3 acrylic bone cement whose constituents were mixed in a proprietary chamber while simultaneously subjected to a vacuum. Selected indices of performance in this material are: mean static compressive strength, 81.4 MPa; mean compressive modulus of elasticity, 1.95 GPa; endurance limit, 8.1 MPa; and characteristic fatigue life (using a three-parameter Weibull fit to the fatigue test data obtained at a stress of +/- 10 MPa), 238,712 cycles. The difficulties in comparing results obtained using different cement formulations, preparation conditions, and test conditions are detailed. With this in mind, it is suggested that the present results are within the range of values reported by previous workers for other formulations mixed using a variety of methods. The clinical significance of the present results is discussed.

Title:Neuropeptide Y suppresses prolactin secretion from rat anterior pituitary cells: evidence for interactions with dopamine through inhibitory coupling to calcium entry.
Authors:['Wang J', 'Ciofi P', 'Crowley WR']
Affiliation:Department of Pharmacology, University of Tennessee, Memphis College of Medicine 38163, USA.
Abstract:Expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the medial basal hypothalamus is increased during lactation, and at least part of this increase is due to the appearance of the peptide in hypothalamic tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons, a cell population that does not exhibit NPY expression in other physiological conditions. The present studies tested the hypothesis that NPY affects PRL secretion by modulating the action of dopamine (DA) at the lactotroph. In static incubations of cultured anterior pituitary (AP) cells, the addition of either NPY or DA in concentrations of 0.1-500 nM resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of PRL secretion, and the combination of DA and NPY in submaximal concentrations produced an additive inhibition of PRL release. NPY also inhibited PRL secretion induced by TRH in perifused AP cells, and the effects were again additive with DA. The interactions of NPY and DA on TRH-induced elevations in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) were examined by loading cultured AP cells of lactating rats with the fluorescent calcium probe fura-2 TRH produced a dose-dependent stimulation of [Ca2+]i, which was characterized by a rapid transient spike and a more prolonged plateau. Both phases were attenuated by either DA or NPY at 100 nM and were nearly abolished by the combination of DA and NPY, whereas neither DA nor NPY altered resting [Ca2+]i. DA and NPY also inhibited the increases in PRL secretion and [Ca2+]i induced by elevated extracellular K+ in an additive manner. Stimulation of AP cells with TRH in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in an attenuated spike of PRL release and [Ca2+]i and no plateau phase. Under these conditions, DA still inhibited the residual [Ca2+]i and PRL responses, but the inhibitory effects of NPY on PRL secretion and [Ca2+]i, and the potentiation by NPY of DA inhibition, were abolished. These results suggest that one physiological function of the NPY expressed in tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons in lactation is to amplify the inhibitory action of DA on PRL secretion through negative coupling to the Ca2+ messenger system, particularly the entry of extracellular Ca2+.

Title:Purification and characterization of lysozyme from hemolymph of Heliothis virescens larvae.
Authors:['Lockey TD', 'Ourth DD']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Division of Molecular Sciences and Microbiology, The University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Lysozyme is an important antibacterial protein in the insect defense system. Lysozyme was isolated from hemolymph of Heliothis virescens larvae using gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. Heliothis lysozyme had a molecular mass of 16,000 daltons by SDS-PAGE. Using acid gel electrophoresis, Heliothis lysozyme migrated faster than egg white lysozyme. The pI of Heliothis lysozyme was estimated as greater than 9.5. Heliothis lysozyme had specific bactericidal activity against three Gram-positive bacteria but no activity against Escherichia coli. The bactericidal activity was stable at 100 degrees C at pH 3.0 after 60 min incubation, but was labile at 100 degrees C at pH 6.8 after 60 min incubation. Heliothis lysozyme was an inducible protein that increased 9 times when comparing unvaccinated with vaccinated larvae. Lysozyme from H. virescens was more similar in molecular mass, heat sensitivity and pH sensitivity to lysozyme isolated from Galleria mellonella and Bombyx mori than to lysozyme isolated from Hyalophora cecropia.

Title:Characterization of HIV incubation distributions and some comparative studies.
Authors:['Tan WY', 'Lee SR', 'Tang SC']
Affiliation:Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:In this paper we use a general stochastic model to characterize the HIV incubation distributions. We generate some Monte Carlo data under different conditions and compare the fitting of HIV incubation distributions by some well known parametric models and some non-parametric methods. The parametric models include most of those that have appeared in the literature. The non-parametric methods include the Kaplan--Meier method, the EMS method, the spline approximation and the Bacchetti method. The comparison criteria are the chi-square statistic, the residual sum of squares, the AIC and the BIC. We show that the non-parametric methods, especially the EMS method, provide excellent fits in almost all cases; for the parametric models, the generalized log-logistic distributions with three and with four parameters fit better than other parametric models.

Title:Formation of pores in Escherichia coli cell membranes by a cecropin isolated from hemolymph of Heliothis virescens larvae.
Authors:['Lockey TD', 'Ourth DD']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, Division of Molecular Sciences and Microbiology, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The insect humoral defense system produces antibacterial peptides called cecropins. Cecropins were initially isolated from Hyalophora cecropia pupae and have since been isolated and identified in various insects. In this study, we have isolated and identified a cecropin from Heliothis virescens larvae. Rabbit IgG were raised against synthetic cecropin B. Affinity chromatography with the rabbit anti-(cecropin B) IgG was used to isolate a cecropin from hemolymph of H. virescens larvae. Acid gel electrophoresis followed by a bacterial-overlay analysis showed that Heliothis cecropin is a basic peptide of low molecular mass with bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli K12 D31. Heliothis cecropin is therefore analogous to synthetic cecropin B. One unresolved issue concerning cecropins and other antibiotic peptides is the mode of action by which they kill bacteria. By means of electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry with gold-labeled rabbit anti-cecropin IgG, binding of purified and synthetic cecropin to the cell membranes of E. coli K12 D31 cells was observed. Small lesions in the cell membrane were seen that had a diameter of 9.6 nm and internal pore of 4.2 nm. The Heliothis cecropin was found to be a pore-forming molecule that causes lesions in the cell membrane of E. coli K12 D31. The lesions lead to leakage of cytoplasmic contents and death of bacteria.

Title:Schizophrenia and psychostimulant abuse: a review and re-analysis of clinical evidence.
Authors:['LeDuc PA', 'Mittleman G']
Affiliation:Psychology Department, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The authors selected articles from those published between 1975 and 1994 that specifically documented psychostimulant abuse in patients determined to be schizophrenic according to recent and relatively uniform diagnostic criteria. These articles indicated that the incidence of psychostimulant abuse in schizophrenics is 2-5 times higher than that of the general public. Additionally, unlike the decline in stimulant use seen in older adults in the general population, high rates of abuse appeared to be maintained in schizophrenics. Although the incidence of abuse in this group was high, comparisons of abuse rates generated by self report with those obtained by urinalysis indicated that the frequency of abuse is being underestimated by 15-21%. Potential factors contributing to stimulant abuse in schizophrenics, including the disease process, and the influence of chronic neuroleptic medication, were evaluated. Results indicated that the incidence of psychostimulant abuse was neither a common property of psychiatric patients, nor exclusive to schizophrenics, but appeared to be related to chronic treatment with neuroleptic drugs. Symptom severity was generally similar in schizophrenic abusers and non-abusers, which also suggested a degree of independence from the disease process. In a majority of the studies surveyed, abuse of stimulants followed disease onset. It was also found that stimulant abuse was associated with marked increases in hospitalization in this patient group, including those known to be neuroleptic medication compliant. Possible explanations for the initiation and maintenance of psychostimulant abuse in schizophrenics are discussed in relation to clinical and preclinical evidence on drug addiction.

Title:Phosphorylation of enkephalins enhances their proteolytic stability.
Authors:['Dass C', 'Mahalakshmi P']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Pharmacological action of enkephalins as opioid peptides is limited because of their rapid degradation by endoproteases. A novel approach is used in this study to prolong the life of those peptides. Phosphorylation of N-terminal tyrosine residue is found to have a profound influence in improving the stability of [Met]enkephalin and [Leu]enkephalin against the action of aminopeptidase M. Whereas, breakdown of [Met]enkephalin and [Leu]enkephalin is essentially complete in less than one min when incubated at 37 degree C with purified aminopeptidase M (EC3.4.11.2; substrate:enzyme = 1:0.1) in Tris buffer (pH 7.02), the corresponding phospho analogs are still detected 60 min after start of incubation. The rate of disappearance of phospho-[Met]enkephalin and phospho-[Leu]enkephalin follows first-order kinetics with half-lives of 7.3 and 8.3 min, respectively.

Abstract:The Ames Salmonella/microsomal assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of some benzamines (aniline, and o- and p-phenylenediamine) and their nitro-derivatives (p-nitroaniline, 2-nitro-p-phenylenediamine, 3- and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine), using strains TA98 and TA100 and their nitroreductase-deficient mutants, TA98NR and TA100NR, in the presence and absence of rat S9 mix. The addition of the nitro-group to benzamine molecules converted them into direct mutagens. Furthermore, the position of the nitro-group affected their mutagenic activities. Cytotoxicity testing with Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) showed that the presence of the nitro-group in these compounds had no specific effect on toxicity. The test compounds all showed a dose-related increase in inducing chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells. However, the presence of the nitro-group did not affect potency in inducing chromosomal aberrations. Compounds containing the nitro-group had higher initial oxidation potentials and dipole moments (mu) than their nonnitro-containing counterparts. The mutagenicity and toxicity of these compounds were not related to physico-chemical properties, including oxidation potential, energy difference (deltaE) between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), ionization potential (I.P.), and mu.

Abstract:The recovery of gamma delta T lymphocytes was studied in 31 recipients of T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow (BMT) to determine if the dynamics of reconstitution could be related to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or other complications of marrow transplantation. Two distinct patterns of regeneration were apparent. In 12 patients, there was a progressive rise in both the percentage and the absolute number of peripheral blood gamma delta T cells over the first year post-transplantation, but these increases never breached levels found in 14 healthy donors. Each of the 19 remaining patients had abnormally high proportions and numbers of gamma delta T cells on at least two occasions following transplantation. The clinical factor that best explained these observations was the frequency of intercurrent infections. Of 19 patients with abnormally increased percentages and numbers of gamma delta T lymphocytes, 18 had one or more episodes of confirmed viral or fungal infection, contrasted with only two of 12 in the comparison group (P < 0.001). There was no significant association of gamma delta T cell recovery patterns with the presence of GVHD (P = 0.33). We conclude that the recovery of gamma delta T lymphocytes after marrow transplantation may vary. Supranormal levels of this T cell subset are associated with infection and may contribute significantly to cellular immune defenses against fungal or viral disease.

Title:Variabilin, a novel RGD-containing antagonist of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa and platelet aggregation inhibitor from the hard tick Dermacentor variabilis.
Authors:['Wang X', 'Coons LB', 'Taylor DB', 'Stevens SE Jr', 'Gartner TK']
Affiliation:Department of Biology, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:A novel inhibitor of human platelet aggregation, named variabilin, was isolated from salivary glands of the hard tick Dermacentor variabilis using a combination of gel filtration and high pressure liquid chromatography. Variabilin was a potent antagonist of the fibrinogen receptor glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa; alphaIIbbeta3) and the vitronectin receptor alphavbeta3. Amino acid sequence analysis by Edman degradation revealed that it has 47 residues, with a molecular weight of 4968.5. Like many other naturally occurring antagonists of GPIIb-IIIa, variabilin contains the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif. However, unlike the RGD-containing antagonists of GPIIb-IIIa, the RGD sequence of variabilin is not positioned in a loop bracketed by cysteine residues. It has little sequence homology to the other known naturally occurring antagonists of GPIIb-IIIa, including the disintegrins from snakes, decorsin and ornatin from leeches, and disagregin from soft ticks. Variabilin is the first RGD-containing antagonist isolated from ticks.

Abstract:OBJECTIVES: To determine changes in bone mineral content (BMC) in male athletes, to examine the mechanisms of changes, and to evaluate the effects of intervention. DESIGN: Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) tests were administered over a 2-year period, and calcium loss during training was determined by analysis of sweat and urine. Calcium supplementation was administered during year 2. SETTING--A midsouth university. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven members of a college Division I-A basketball team. INTERVENTION: Based on observed calcium loss, athletes received differential levels of calcium supplementation. Intervention commenced the week prior to the fall training season and continued through postseason play. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Changes in BMC. RESULTS: Total body BMC decreased 3.8% from preseason to midseason of year 1 (mean decrease, 133.4 g, P = .02), increased nonsignificantly by 1.1% (mean increase, 35.3 g, P = .22) during the offseason, but decreased an additional 3.3% during summer months when practices resumed (mean decrease, 113.1 g, P = .01). Dermal calcium loss averaged 247 mg [corrected] per training session. From preseason to late summer, there was an overall decrease of 6.1% in total BMC and a 10.5% decrease in BMC of the legs. Calcium supplementation was associated with significant increases in BMC and lean body mass. CONCLUSIONS: Bone loss is calcium related and exercise is positively related to BMC provided that calcium intake is sufficient to offset dermal loss.

Title:Behavior segmentation by boys as a function of aggressiveness and prior information.
Authors:['Courtney ML', 'Cohen R']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Previous research documents a hostile attribution bias by aggressive boys when considering a social situation with ambiguous cues as to the intention of the participants. The present research evaluated whether this bias extends to the manner in which boys process incoming information. Aggressiveness of boys in grades 3-6 was assessed with peer behavior nominations. In a separate session, each child viewed a videotape of 2 boys playing tag on a playground and segmented the actions using a standard behavior segmentation procedure. A critical event occurred when one of the boys fell down after being tagged, slowly got up, then resumed the game. Prior to viewing the videotape each child received one of three information conditions: benign (the boys were friends), hostile (the boys did not like one another), or neutral (no specific information about the relationship between the boys). Aggressiveness predicted change in segmentation after the critical event only in the neutral prior information condition. Thus aggressiveness, found in other research to be associated with a hostile attribution bias, also was found to be related to differences in the organization of incoming information.

Title:Parametric stress analysis of bonded "combination-materials" type of orthodontic brackets.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Manickam S', 'Smart FM']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The finite element analysis method and a two-dimensional idealization were used to conduct a detailed parametric study of the stresses in and displacement of models of bonded edgewise "combination-materials" type of orthodontic brackets when subjected to loading and constraint conditions that are deemed to be the same as those that exist in vivo. A "combination-materials" type bracket is herein defined as one in which different materials are used in fabricating the main body and the archwire slot. The present study was conducted in three parts. In Part 1, 16 model cases were analyzed, involving 4 different combinations of materials (for the main body of the bracket and its archwire slot) and 4 different overall bracket configurations (comprising main body, base and slot). The focus of Part 2 was the model bracket configuration that was, on the basis of Part 1 results, deemed to show the "optimum performance". In this part, the parameter investigated was the value of the modulus of elasticity of the adhesive, Eadh. In Part 3, the concept of an efficiency index of the bonded bracket-archwire system, eta, was introduced and explained. The dependence of eta on stated characteristics of a rectangular archwire, for the "optimum performance" model, was explored. Part 1 results led to the conclusion that the "optimum performance" model has equally angulated buccal and lingual edges and the main body and archwire slot are fabricated from glass fiber-reinforced polycarbonate and stainless steel, respectively. Part 2 results showed that, for the aforementioned "optimum performance" model, the longitudinal displacement of the archwire slot is fairly insensitive to Eadh. Part 3 results showed that eta is intimately related to each of the wire characteristics studied (namely cross-sectional dimensions, "interbracket distance" and modulus of rigidity of the material).

Title:Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor attenuates physiological sleep in rabbits.
Authors:['Takahashi S', 'Kapas L', 'Seyer JM', 'Wang Y', 'Krueger JM']
Affiliation:Department of Physiology, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163, USA.
Abstract:The involvement of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in sleep regulation was investigated by blocking TNF using a synthetic TNF receptor fragment (TNFRF) in rabbits. Intracerebroventricular injection of 50 micrograms TNFRF decreased spontaneous non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep across the 21 h recording period. After 6 h of sleep deprivation (SD), both duration of NREM sleep and electroencephalographic (EEG) slow wave activity during NREM sleep were enhanced. TNFRF suppressed SD-enhanced NREM sleep and EEG slow wave activity. SD per se did not affect rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, but TNFRF treatment increased REM sleep after SD. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that TNF is involved in the regulation of physiological NREM sleep.

Title:A numerical analysis of factor X activation in the presence of tissue factor--factor VIIa complex in a flow reactor.

Abstract:A mathematical model has been developed to investigate previously obtained experimental findings relating to the activation of factor X by surface-bound tissue factor--factor VIIa (TF:VIIa) in a tubular flow reactor. In those experiments, factor X was perfused through a microcapillary tube over a range of flow (shear) conditions and the activated product, factor Xa, was measured at the outlet of the tube using a chromogenic assay. In the present study, the steady-state convection-diffusion equation with Michaelis-Menten kinetics used to describe the reaction at the wall was numerically integrated using an implicit method based on linear systems of ordinary differential equations. The results from the numerical analysis indicated that shear rate directly affects both Km and Vmax. Values of Km decreased from 151 to 16 nM as the shear rate increased from 25 to 2400 sec-1. Additionally, there was a twofold increase in Vmax from 1.4 to 3.0 pmol/cm2/min as the shear rate increased from 25 to 300 sec-1. These findings are in contrast with classical enzyme behavior and imply a direct effect of fluid flow on the kinetics of factor X activation.

Title:An interleukin-1 receptor fragment inhibits spontaneous sleep and muramyl dipeptide-induced sleep in rabbits.

Abstract:Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is hypothesized to be involved in physiological sleep regulation and in sleep responses occurring during infectious disease. If this hypothesis is correct, then inhibition of endogenous IL-1 should reduce both normal sleep and N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP)-induced sleep. MDP is a somnogenic substance derived from bacterial cell walls. We report here the effects of a synthetic IL-1 receptor fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 86-95 of the human type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RF) on spontaneous sleep and IL-1 beta- and MDP-induced sleep and fever in rabbits. Two doses of the IL-1RF (25 and 50 micrograms) were injected into normal rabbits intracerebroventricularly (icv). Both doses significantly decreased spontaneous non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) across a 22-h recording period. Pretreatment of rabbits with 25 micrograms of IL-1RF blocked the somnogenic actions of 10 ng icv IL-1. Similarly, central pretreatment of animals with 25 micrograms IL-1RF significantly attenuated the NREMS-promoting and REMS-suppressive actions of 150 pmol MDP injected centrally. The increase in NREMS and decrease in REMS induced by systemic injection of 12.5 micrograms/kg MDP were also significantly suppressed by central administration of 50 micrograms IL-1RF. In contrast, the febrile response induced by either intracerebroventricularly or intravenously injected MDP were not significantly affected by IL-1RF. These results support the hypothesis that endogenous, brain-derived IL-1 contributes to the maintenance of normal sleep and may mediate sleep responses to systemic as well as central bacterial infections.

Abstract:The finite element analysis method was used to obtain values of the von Mises equivalent stress (SEQV) at selected locations within the adhesive layer of two-dimensional models of bonded orthodontic brackets. In all, 39 model cases were analyzed involving 4 overall bracket configurations, 3 combinations of materials of fabrication of the bracket, 3 types of debonding forces and 4 adhesives. The results are presented to show the sensitivity of SEQV to each of the parameters studied. Comments are made on the usefulness of the results in the development of a standard protocol for experimental determination of the bond strength of adhesives used in securing orthodontic brackets.

Title:The role of a liquid matrix in controlling FAB-induced fragmentation.
Authors:['Dass C']
Affiliation:Department of Chemistry, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Substantial differences were observed in terms of extent of fragmentation and type of ions in the conventional fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectra of peptides between different liquid matrices (such as glycerol, thioglycerol, dithiothreitol, thiodiglycol, 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol, diglyme, and sulfolane). The use of glycerol leads to extensive fragmentation. Such differences were also observed for other classes of analytes such as anthracyclines and phosphocinnamates. It is rationalized that the internal energy of the molecular ions of the analyte is controlled by desolvation of the FAB-desorbed analyte/matrix clusters. Differences in the relative abundances of the amino acid sequence determining ions were also noted. For example, in glycerol, the z-type sequence ions are more prominent for peptides containing basic amino acid residues, whereas in thioglycerol and dithiothreitol, the y-type ions dominate. These differences are correlated to the ion-dipole type of adduct formation in glycerol.

Title:Antiplatelet agents affecting the interaction of Tissue Factor-Factor VIIa complex with Factor X in a continuous-flow reactor.
Authors:['Gir S', 'Reavis R', 'Turitto VT', 'Gollamudi R']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The purpose of the present study was to examine the role of antithrombotic agents in the activation of Factor X in the presence of the Tissue Factor-Factor VIIa (TF-VIIa) complex in a continuous-flow reactor. Tissue Factor immobilized in a phospholipid bilayer on the inner surface of a capillary tube (internal diameter = 0.27 mm) was exposed to a perfusate containing Factors VIIa and X flowing at a flow rate of 12.7 microliters/min, corresponding to a wall shear rate of 100 s-1. Factor Xa (the activated form of Factor X) in the effluent was determined by a chromogenic assay. The effectiveness of two platelet aggregation inhibitors, alpha,alpha'-bis-[3-(N,N-diethylcarbamoyl)piperidino-p-xylene dihydrobromide (A-1) and alpha,alpha'-bis-[3-N-benzyl-N-methylcarbamoyl)piperidino]-p-xylen e dihydrobromide (A-4) in inhibiting Factor X activation is reported here. The results suggest that the Tissue Factor pathway, mediated through TF-VIIa complex, produces significantly lower levels of Factor Xa in the presence of compounds A-1 and A-4. On the basis of these findings, it appears that the anticoagulation action of these compounds reinforces their platelet aggregation-inhibitory properties. These carbamoylpiperidines (nipecotamides) therefore appear to be useful antithrombotic agents.

Title:Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha as a result of glia-T-cell interaction correlates with the pathogenic activity of myelin basic protein-reactive T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

Abstract:Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has attracted the greatest attention as a major factor in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) pathogenesis. We compared rats undergoing EAE with manipulated but healthy animals by examining TNF-alpha gene expression in cells recovered from the brain. We used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as a sensitive assay for detection and Northern blot hybridization as a reliable quantitative assay of TNF-alpha mRNA. TNF-alpha gene expression was consistently detected in rats immunized with myelin basic protein (MBP) emulsified in complete Freund adjuvant (CFA), but not in rats immunized with MBP emulsified in incomplete Freund adjuvant (IFA), which does not induce EAE. Similarly, brain-derived cells from rats injected with cloned encephalitogenic T cells contained increased amounts of TNF-alpha mRNA compared with rats injected with nonencephalitogenic T cell clones similar in antigen specificity and in vitro lymphokine-producing capacity. Considering that the differing pathogenic capacity of MBP-reactive T cells might result from differing patterns of interaction with glia, we examined the impact of T-cell-glia interaction in vitro on cytokine gene expression in both cell types. Glial components were efficient in inducing TNF-alpha expression in T cells; T cells and T-cell-derived cytokines could elicit expression of several lymphokine genes in glial cells. Comparison of RT-PCR and blot hybridization assays, however, suggested that cytokine expression was much more efficient, on a per cell basis, in T cells than in glia. TNF-alpha was shown to have direct cytotoxic effect on glial cells, which was greatly enhanced by small amounts of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).

Abstract:By using a two stage model of carcinogenesis, we generated Monte Carlo studies to assess the efficiency and robustness of the 3-poly test for animal carcinogenicity experiments. The Monte Carlo results indicate that the 3-poly test is quite powerful for detecting the carcinogenic effects of complete carcinogens, moderate promoters, and initiators with moderate or large effect, but, in some cases, it is less powerful for weak initiators or weak promoters. As expected, the 3-poly test is insensitive to the toxicity of many agents.

Abstract:This study examined the effects of ingesting nutritional supplements designed to promote lean tissue accretion on body composition alterations during resistance training. Twenty-eight resistance-trained males blindly supplemented their diets with maltodextrin (M), Gainers Fuel 1000 (GF), or Phosphagain (P). No significant differences were observed in absolute or relative total body water among groups. Energy intake and body weight significantly increased in all groups combined throughout the study with no group or interaction differences observed. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry-determined body mass significantly increased in each group throughout the study with significantly greater gains observed in the GF and P groups. Lean tissue mass (excluding bone) gain was significantly greater in the P group, while fat mass and percent body fat were significantly increased in the GF group. Results indicate that total body weight significantly increased in each group and that P supplementation resulted in significantly greater gains in lean tissue mass during resistance training.

Title:Visuospatial attention in the rat and posterior parietal cortex lesions.
Authors:['Rosner AL', 'Mittleman G']
Affiliation:Psychology Department, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Covert attention to visuospatial stimuli was assessed in rats using a modified version of a task designed for human subjects. Rats were trained to respond toward bright target lights presented to the right or left visual space. Dim cue lights served to attract their attention prior to the onset of the bright target lights. Consistent with previous research using similar paradigms, rats in this experiment displayed longer reaction times during trials in which the cue and target lights were presented on opposite sides of visual space. Throughout pre- and post-operative testing, individual subjects showed lateralized differences in the performance of this task as indicated by asymmetries in reaction time, the percentage of correct responses, and the number of responses made to each side of visual space (response bias). Lesioning the area of cortex thought to be a possible homolog of the posterior parietal cortex in primates produced no specific effects on performance. It is suggested that this paradigm may tap into an evolutionarily conserved attentional process, but that this process may be subserved by somewhat different neural structures in different species.

Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, USA.
Abstract:This experiment evaluated the efficacy of television delivery of a behavioral weight reduction program. Seventy-one overweight adults were randomly assigned to a live-contact weight loss group that was videotaped for viewing by other groups, a live-contact group that was not videotaped, a television-delivered group that observed the videotaped weight loss sessions, or a waiting-list control group. Participants in all 3 treatment groups lost significantly more weight during the 8-week treatment program than those in the waiting-list control group. There was no significant weight loss differences among the 3 treatment groups during the program. These weight changes were maintained at 3-month follow-up. At 15-month follow-up, the television-delivered group and the live-contact group maintained their weight losses, whereas the videotaped group did not. Cost-effectiveness analyses indicated that the television-delivered group received the most cost-effective treatment.

Title:Melatonin treatment affects the attractiveness of the anogenital area scent in meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus).
Authors:['Ferkin MH', 'Kile JR']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Department of Biology, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Seasonal differences exist in the attractiveness of scents in meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus. To determine whether photoperiodically induced changes in the attractiveness of a sex-specific scent is governed by melatonin, we implanted long-photoperiod male and female scent donors with a Silastic implant containing a 10-mm active length of melatonin, a 20-mm active length of melatonin, or no melatonin. The first experiment shows that 8 weeks of melatonin treatment is sufficient to induce long-photoperiod voles to produce scents that are no longer attractive to the opposite sex. The second experiment shows that a similar time course of melatonin treatment was sufficient to induce long-photoperiod females treated with melatonin to produce scents that are attractive to short-photoperiod females. Melatonin implants lowered the gonadal hormone titers and reduced the weight of the gonads of treated long-photoperiod voles to titers and weights that are characteristic of short-photoperiod voles. In both experiments, the behavioral and physiological effects were independent of whether scent donors received 10- or 20-mm implants of melatonin. Together, the results of the two experiments reveal that melatonin mediates the photoperiodically induced changes in gonadal hormone titers that control the seasonal differences in the sexual attractiveness of the anogenital area scent produced by meadow voles.

Title:The hippocampus and reward: effects of hippocampal lesions on progressive-ratio responding.
Authors:['Schmelzeis MC', 'Mittleman G']

Abstract:Two experiments investigated the effects of ibotenic-acid lesions of the hippocampus on food-rewarded performance under a progressive-ratio 10 schedule of reinforcement. The results of Experiment 1 indicated that rats with hippocampal lesions showed profound increases in breakpoint and enhancements in the efficiency of responding. In a second experiment the same rats were challenged with prefeeding, increases in the height of the response lever, and the substitution of sucrose- for grain-based reward pellets. Responding in both groups was similarly reduced by prefeeding and increases in the effortfulness of responding, but lesioned rats were significantly more responsive to the change to sucrose reward. Overall, the results indicated that hippocampal damage increased responding by enhancing the activational or hedonic properties of the delivered food pellets, while not affecting food-motivation or the motor capacity to respond.

Abstract:The Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins plays important roles in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and cell growth. Activation of these GTPases involves the replacement of bound GDP with GTP, a process catalyzed by the Dbl-like guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, all of which seem to share a putative catalytic motif termed the Dbl homology (DH) domain, followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Here we have examined the role of a Dbl-like molecule, the faciogenital dysplasia gene product (FGD1), which when mutated in its Dbl homology domain, cosegregates with the developmental disease Aarskog-Scott syndrome. We report that a polypeptide of FGD1 encompassing the DH and PH domains can bind specifically to the Rho family GTPase Cdc42Hs and stimulates the GDP-GTP exchange of the isoprenylated form of Cdc42Hs. Microinjection of this FGD1 polypeptide into Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cells induces the formation of peripheral actin microspikes, similar to that previously observed when cells were injected with a constitutively active form of Cdc42Hs. This effect of FGD1 on actin organization is readily inhibited by coinjection of a dominant-negative mutant of Cdc42Hs. Examination of NIH 3T3 cells expressing the FGD1 fragment revealed that similar to cells expressing Dbl, two independent elements downstream of Cdc42Hs, the Jun NH2-terminal kinase and the p70 S6 kinase, became activated. Hence, our results indicate that FGD1, through its DH and PH domains, acts as a Cdc42Hs-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor and suggest that the Cdc42Hs GTPase may have a role in mammalian development.

Title:Benefit acclimatization in elderly hearing aid users.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC', 'Taylor IM', 'Gray GA']
Affiliation:School of Audiology & Speech-Language Pathology, University of Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.
Abstract:A previous study from this laboratory indicated that the benefit obtained from a hearing aid in a noisy environment might increase over the first few months of hearing aid use. It was hypothesized that this acclimatization of benefit was due to a process in which the individual optimized his/her use of modified or newly available high-frequency acoustic speech cues. This investigation further explored the effect in 22 elderly individuals with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing losses, fitted unilaterally with hearing aids. None of the subjects was a current or recent hearing aid wearer. Speech intelligibility testing over a 12-week post-fitting period indicated that a significant improvement in benefit was seen for the group as a whole, probably beginning after about 6 weeks of regular hearing aid use. However, the magnitude of improvement was very small for most subjects. Only three individuals experienced a dramatic improvement in their benefit for speech in noise over this period. No evidence was found for a specific role of high-frequency cues. Seven subjects participated in a long-term follow-up in which benefit was measured after several months of use of their newly acquired personal hearing aids. Further increase in benefit was noted but was due exclusively to a decline in performance for unaided listening.

Abstract:Various pathologies, notably rheumatoid arthritis and/or trauma, are all known to cause severe pain and/or reduction of functional motion at the elbow joint. Implantation of a total arthroplasty, in such cases, has emerged as the first choice for management. For acceptable clinical performance, such an arthroplasty should be designed fully cognizant of various germane aspects of the anatomy, kinesiology and biomechanics of the normal joint. These aspects, together with a critical appraisal of the different classes of arthroplasty designs and a discussion of areas for further research (aimed at improving the in vivo performance of the prosthesis), are the subjects of the present review.

Abstract:The stresses in various sections of two-dimensional models of the elbow joint, without and with a prosthesis (the humeral component of a total elbow prosthesis), were obtained using the finite element analysis method. Three parameters were varied: type of applied load; method of fixation of the prosthesis to the contiguous bone; and shape of the head of the prosthesis. The results are discussed with particular reference to stress shielding and overload in the cortical and cancellous bones, respectively, and a qualitative comparison between the present values and those given by previous workers who used three-dimensional models. Comments are made regarding the clinical implications of the results.

Abstract:Chromosomal polymorphism was assessed in the southern short-tailed shrew (Blarina carolinensis) using standard metaphase chromosome and G-banding techniques. Twenty-one animals (11 males, 10 females) from the Meeman Biological Station in Shelby Co., Tennessee, were examined for diploid number. Results showed diploid numbers of 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 and 41 and fundamental numbers of 41, 42, 43, 44 and 45. No diploid numbers or fundamental numbers were unique to a specific collecting locality. The first G-banded karyotypes are reported for the species. These results indicate that Robertsonian polymorphisms, inversions, and possibly other events are responsible for chromosomal variation in B. carolinensis.

Abstract:One of the problems inherent in using women in clinical research is the effect that oral contraceptive (OC) use might have on physical indexes. Although weight gain is frequently reported as a side effect of OC use, there is little empirical evidence that such weight gain actually occurs. The current study investigated differences in energy balance [ie, dietary intake, resting energy expenditure (REE), and physical activity] between groups of users and nonusers of OCs. Each group completed a protocol that covered one menstrual cycle and consisted of daily recording of dietary intake, measurement of REE once during each phase of the menstrual cycle, and reporting of physical activity over the entire cycle. Comparisons indicate that there was a marginal interaction (P = 0.06) of OC use with total energy intake, indicating a different pattern of intake for the two groups. There were qualitative between-group differences such that the OC group consumed a greater percentage of energy as fat (P = 0.02) and a lesser percentage of energy as carbohydrate (P = 0.008). No group differences were found in the percentage of energy consumed as protein, but both groups consumed significantly less protein during menses (P = 0.008). There were no significant differences in REE. Both groups of women reported marginally more activity (P = 0.09) during menses than during the luteal phase.

Title:The effects of limbic lesions on locomotion and stereotypy elicited by dopamine agonists in the rat.

Abstract:The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the functional contributions of various limbic structures to locomotion and stereotypy induced by dopaminergic drugs. Female rats were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups (n = 10-14 rats/group) that received either a lesion of the hippocampus (colchicine + kainic acid), basolateral amygdala (quinolinic acid), frontal cortex (aspiration), nucleus accumbens (ibotenic acid), or served as unoperated controls. Beginning at least 2 weeks following surgery locomotion (measured as photocell beam breaks) elicited by D-amphetamine (0.0, 0.32, 1.0 and 3.2 mg/kg), SKF 82958 (0.0, 0.04, 0.08 and 0.16 mg/kg) or quinpirole (0.0, 0.25, 0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) was determined. In agreement with previous results rats with hippocampal lesions were hyperactive in response to amphetamine. In comparison to these changes in drug-induced locomotion, lesions of the basolateral amygdala, and frontal cortex had only minor effects on drug-induced locomotion. Lesions of the nucleus accumbens produced consistent hyperactivity that was suppressed by doses of amphetamine or quinpirole that elicited behavioral stereotypy. These results provide evidence suggesting that, in comparison to other limbic structures that have substantial inputs to the nucleus accumbens, the hippocampus play a relatively prominent role in the modulation of drug-induced locomotion.

Abstract:The role that ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) wear at bearing surfaces in total hip and knee arthroplasties plays in the clinical life of these implants cannot be overemphasized. This subject has therefore been attracting enormous research attention on both fundamental and technological levels. Given this, it is important to detail the main features of the knowledge base and describe research directions that may culminate in the production of new and/or improved varieties of UHMWPE material and components. These aspects are the subject of the present review.

Title:How much weight gain occurs following smoking cessation? A comparison of weight gain using both continuous and point prevalence abstinence.

Abstract:Estimates of postcessation weight gain vary widely. This study determined the magnitude of weight gain in a cohort using both point prevalence and continuous abstinence criteria for cessation. Participants were 196 volunteers who participated in a smoking cessation program and who either continuously smoked (n = 118), were continuously abstinent (n = 51), or who were point prevalent abstinent (n = 27) (i.e., quit at the 1-year follow-up visit but not at others). Continuously abstinent participants gained over 13 lbs. (5.90 kg) at 1 year, significantly more than continuously smoking (M = 2.4 lb.) and point prevalent abstinent participants (M = 6.7 lbs., or 3.04 kg). Individual growth curve analysis confirmed that weight gain and the rate of weight gain (pounds per month) were greater among continuously smoking participants and that these effects were independent of gender, baseline weight, smoking and dieting history, age, and education. Results suggest that studies using point prevalence abstinence to estimate postcessation weight gain may be underestimating postcessation weight gain.

Title:Are weight concerns predictive of smoking cessation? A prospective analysis.
Authors:['Meyers AW', 'Klesges RC', 'Winders SE', 'Ward KD', 'Peterson BA', 'Eck LH']
Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Participants in an 8-session, community based smoking cessation intervention rated whether they would stay quit if they experienced weight gain. The majority reported that they would not relapse to smoking, even after a 20-lb, (9.07-kg) weight gain. Those who were weight concerned were more likely to be female, to weight less and be normal or underweight, and to report chronic dieting. This group was also significantly less likely to be abstinent posttreatment, and at the 1-, 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Individuals presenting for formal smoking cessation interventions may be less weight concerned than the general population of smokers. However, weight-concerned smokers who do present for treatment are less likely to quit smoking. Implications for recruitment and intervention are discussed.

Title:Properties of acrylic bone cement: state of the art review.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:Acrylic bone cement occupies a distinctive place in the hierarchy of synthetic biomaterials, because it is the only material currently used for anchoring the prosthesis to the contiguous bone in a cemented arthroplasty. However, the cement is not without its drawbacks. The main one is the role that it has been postulated to play in the aseptic loosening and, hence, clinical life of the arthroplasty. In turn, this role is directly related to the mechanical properties of the cement, especially the resistance to fracture of the cement in the mantle at the cement-prosthesis interface or the cement-bone interface. The present work is a detailed critical review of the recent literature on the properties of bone cement that are considered germane to its use in the stated application. The relevant properties are identified and a case is made for including each of them. Compilations of the values of these properties, obtained under clearly identified conditions, are presented for the six commercial formulations of bone cement in current popular orthopedic use. The gaps and unresolved questions in the current data base, efforts that should be made to address these issues, and research directions are covered.

Title:Testing for treatment related trend with partially exchangeable clustered data.
Authors:['George EO', 'Wu H']
Affiliation:Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:When testing for treatment related effect, it is common to focus on data that describe some primary response, even though an experiment might yield data on secondary, less conspicuous effects. An example of such an experiment can be found in developmental toxicity studies, where a primary response might be the presence of skeletal malformation in a fetus, and a secondary effect might be reduced weight. In such studies, weight reduction may occur not only among malformed fetuses, but also among normal fetuses. In this paper, we use a likelihood ratio procedure to construct treatment related trend tests for developmental experiments with such outcomes. We assume that within each cluster, data are partially exchangeable and we use the presence or absence of malformations as categorical covariates. Two models are considered for the covariance structures: In the general model, partially exchangeable covariance matrices are used for each cluster within dose groups. In the homogeneous model, a common exchangeable covariance matrix is used for all clusters. Maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of unknown parameters in the general model are obtained by directly maximizing the log-likelihood function through careful numerical consideration, while MLEs of parameters of teh homogeneous model are obtained through an iterative procedure. Two applications to developmental toxicity data are described.

Title:Disfluency in spasmodic dysphonia: a multivariate analysis.
Authors:['Cannito MP', 'Burch AR', 'Watts C', 'Rappold PW', 'Hood SB', 'Sherrard K']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Tennessee, USA. mpcannito@cc.memphis.edu
Abstract:This study examined visual analog scaling (VAS) judgments of disfluency by normal listeners in response to oral reading by speakers with spasmodic dysphonia (SD) and by nondysphonic controls, as well as the variables of frequency of occurrence of disfluencies, speaking rate, number of reading errors, and temporal acoustic measures of interword interval duration and articulation time. MANOVA yielded statistically significant differences between SD and control speakers for all variables except reading errors. Although no significant fluency-related differences were observed in terms of type of vocal spasm or voice tremor, significant differences in disfluency measures were obtained for clinical ratings of severity of dysphonia. Greater dysphonia severity ratings were associated with decreased fluency, but milder ratings were not necessarily associated with disfluency. Stepwise multiple regression analysis demonstrated that frequency of disfluency occurrence, speaking rate, and reading errors accounted for more than three fourths of the variability in VAS judgments of disfluency. Findings suggest that although disfluency is not a defining feature of SD, it does contribute significantly to the overall clinical impression of severity of the disorder.

Title:Mice lacking the TNF 55 kDa receptor fail to sleep more after TNFalpha treatment.
Authors:['Fang J', 'Wang Y', 'Krueger JM']
Affiliation:Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA.
Abstract:Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a well characterized sleep-regulatory substance. To study receptor mechanisms for the sleep-promoting effects of TNF, sleep patterns were determined in control and TNF 55 kDa receptor knock-out (TNFR-KO) mice with a B6 x 129 background after intraperitoneal injections of saline or murine TNFalpha. The TNFR-KO mice had significantly less baseline sleep than the controls. TNFalpha dose-dependently increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) in the controls but did not influence sleep in TNFR-KO mice. Although TNFR-KO mice failed to respond to TNFalpha, they had an increase in NREMS and a decrease in rapid eye movement sleep after interleukin-1beta treatment. These results indicate that TNFalpha affects sleep via the 55 kDa receptor and provide further evidence that TNFalpha is involved in physiological sleep regulation. Current results also extend the list of species to mice in which TNFalpha and interleukin-1beta are somnogenic.

Title:Microinjection of anti-alpha-tubulin antibody (DM1A) inhibits progesterone-induced meiotic maturation and deranges the microtubule array in follicle-enclosed oocytes of the frog, Rana pipiens.

Abstract:Microinjection of anti-alpha-tubulin (Dm1A) inhibited progesterone-induced meiotic maturation in large follicle-enclosed oocytes of the frog, Rana pipiens. DM1A (46 nl; 10 mg/ml) injection significantly increased the ED50 value for progesterone as determined by germinal vesicle dissolution (GVD) bioassay. By contrast, low doses of microinjected DM1A (46 nl; 2.5 mg/ml), anti-actin (clone KJ43A), anti-cytokeratin (C-11), anti-intermediate filament antibody (IFA), generic IgG (46 nl; 20 mg/ml) or sodium azide (46 nl; 1 mg/ml), an antibody preservative, were without inhibitory effect in this bioassay. Microinjected, affinity-purified DM1A (46 nl; 7.5 mg/ml) was also inhibitory, but preabsorption with pure tubulin prior to injection significantly reduced the inhibitory effect. DM1A injection had no effect on centrifugation-induced germinal vesicle migration (GVM). Previous work indicated that drugs (e.g. demecolcine and nocodazole), which destabilise microtubules, enhance both centrifugation-induced GVM and progesterone-induced GVD in Rana oocytes. Taking these results together, it is suggested that DM1A injection may have differential effects on microtubules in this cell. Thus, while the majority of microtubules were apparently depolymerised by DM1A (46 nl; 10 mg/ml) injection, a small subpopulation appeared to be stabilised as bundles. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of follicle-enclosed oocytes after DM1A injection revealed a major loss of microtubules throughout the cell; however, apparent sparse bundles of microtubules arranged in an approximately 600 microns shell were associated with the injectate region 24 h post-injection. By contrast, control follicle-enclosed oocytes topically labelled with DM1A post-fixation had extensive microtubule arrays similar to those previously reported in Xenopus oocytes. Intracellular recording after DM1A injection and progesterone treatment yielded an intermediate membrane potential (Vm = -31.8 mV) compared with control (immature) DM1A-injected cells (Vm = -44.7 mV) or potassium balanced salt solution (KBS)-injected cells matured with progesterone (Vm = -13.9 mV). These results suggest that DM1A injection does not completely inhibit electrophysiological changes initiated by progesterone. Working hypotheses are proposed that suggest a role for microtubules in the action of progesterone which normally lifts the prophase I block in the Rana follicle-enclosed oocyte.

Title:The peptide LSARLAF causes platelet secretion and aggregation by directly activating the integrin alphaIIbbeta3.
Authors:['Derrick JM', 'Taylor DB', 'Loudon RG', 'Gartner TK']
Affiliation:Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, University of Memphis, Campus Box 526041, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:A novel peptide (designed to bind to alphaIIbbeta3) caused platelet aggregation and aggregation-independent secretion of the contents of alpha-granules in an alphaIIbbeta3-dependent fashion. The agonist peptide induced secretion in the presence of prostaglandin E1. In cell-free assays, alphaIIbbeta3 bound specifically to immobilized agonist peptide and the peptide enhanced the binding of fibrinogen to immobilized alphaIIbbeta3. The agonist peptide apparently activates alphaIIbbeta3 by directly inducing a conformational change in the receptor. This change activates the platelets and causes secretion in a manner independent of fibrinogen binding.

Abstract:BACKGROUND: A retrospective study evaluated the clinical characteristics, prognostic factors, and outcome of patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial malignant gliomas treated with preirradiation chemotherapy. METHODS: Of 41 patients with supratentorial malignant gliomas accrued between 1984-1994, all had neuroimaging documentation of the extent of resection and 37 had complete neuraxis staging prior to treatment; 80% were treated with one of a variety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens. RESULTS: Thirteen patients had anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), 25 had glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and 3 had anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Gross total resection (GTR) was performed in 10 patients, subtotal resection (STR) in 22 patients, and biopsy (Bx) alone in 9 patients. For the entire group the 3-year overall and progression free survivals were 35 +/- 8% and 18 +/- 6%, respectively. Tumor recurrence was dominantly local. However, 9 patients with initially local disease failed at a distant neuraxis site, giving a 26 +/- 7% actuarial risk of dissemination at 3 years. The only significant prognostic factor was extent of tumor resection: patients who underwent GTR survived longer than those who underwent STR or Bx (P = 0.004). Histology (GBM vs. AA), age, and the use of enhanced local dose radiation therapy (brachytherapy or stereotactic irradiation) did not affect survival. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with a survival rate significantly different from that observed in adjuvant chemotherapy studies. Systematic neuraxis staging at diagnosis and recurrence revealed a rate of neuraxis dissemination as a component of recurrence that was higher than previously reported; the utility of craniospinal irradiation in preventing isolated dissemination remains uncertain.

Abstract:PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of primary tumor site, age at diagnosis, extent of resection, and histology on progression-free survival (PFS) in pediatric low-grade astrocytoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical, pathologic, and imaging information were reviewed for 142 children (ages 2 months to 19 years) with low-grade astrocytoma treated between January 1984 and July 1994. Gross total resection (GTR) was attempted for cerebellar and cerebral hemisphere tumors, with biopsy or less aggressive resection used predominantly for tumors in other sites. Surgery was followed by observation in 107 cases, radiation therapy in 31, and chemotherapy in four. RESULTS: The overall survival rate was 90% +/- 3% (SE) at 4 years. PFS was significantly better for patients with cerebellar and cerebral hemisphere tumors (n = 75) than those with tumors in all other sites (P = .0006). Within the former group, there was no significant difference in PFS for patients in whom GTR was achieved versus those with incomplete resections (4-year estimates, 89% and 77%, respectively). Histology (juvenile pilocytic v astrocytoma not otherwise specified [NOS]) was not related to PFS in an analysis that controlled for tumor site and patient age. Patients younger than 5 years at diagnosis had a significantly poorer PFS than older children, regardless of histology (P < .03) or tumor site (P < .002). Treatment for progressive/recurrent disease was effective in a majority of patients, but appeared more successful in patients with hemispheric than thalamic or hypothalamic tumors. CONCLUSION: The overall survival in this series of pediatric low-grade astrocytomas is excellent. Age at diagnosis and tumor location, but not histology, had a significant impact on PFS. Efforts to improve treatment outcome should focus on young patients (< 5 years) and on those with central midline tumors. The majority of patients with completely resected hemispheric tumors were monitored without further therapy, which supports attempted GTR of cerebral and cerebellar hemisphere low-grade astrocytoma.

Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA.
Abstract:This investigation was designed to identify the risk factors associated with different stages of cigarette use in a large biracial adolescent sample. A questionnaire assessing smoking habits and variables thought to be related to smoking was administered to 6,967 7th graders. Analysis revealed that the best predictor of experimentation with cigarettes was the perception that they were easily available. Regular smoking appeared to be heavily influenced by cost. Social influences contributed to both experimental and regular smoking, but the impact of social models varied with ethnicity and gender. Analysis further revealed that weight-related variables were closely tied to regular smoking. Implications of the findings for smoking prevention programs are discussed.

Abstract:Implantation of an interlocking intramedullary nail has rapidly become the modality of choice for the management of various fractures of the humeral shaft; namely, those that are not minimally displaced, impacted and/or stable. The mechanical properties of the nail per se or the nail-bone construct are essential to the nail's satisfactory clinical performance. The present work is a critical review of this topic, using reports given in the opne literature. Whence, gaps and unresolved controversies in the current knowledge base are identified. Expositions on future work, based on the foregoing observations as well as uncharted topics, are presented.

Abstract:The finite element analysis method and a two-dimensional idealization were used to conduct a parametric study of the effect of the archwire slot (or insert) profile on the stresses in, deformation of, and efficiency of a model of a bonded edge-wise "combination-materials" type of orthodontic bracket. The results are consistent with a priori expectations and are qualitatively the same as those obtained by previous workers who used the two-dimensional photoelasticity stress analysis method. The results thus highlight a possible approach to improving the clinical performance of these brackets.

Title:The role of putative fibrinogen Aalpha-, Bbeta-, and GammaA-chain integrin binding sites in endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction.
Authors:['Smith RA', 'Mosesson MW', 'Rooney MM', 'Lord ST', 'Daniels AU', 'Gartner TK']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, Memphis, Tennessee 38152, USA. rsmith@utmem1.utmem.edu
Abstract:In this study, endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction was supported by fibrin generated from several purified fractions of plasma fibrinogen, purified proteolytic fragments of plasma fibrinogen, recombinant normal fibrinogen, and recombinant variant fibrinogen. These results were surprising because some of these fibrinogens lack domains that are known binding sites for the integrin receptors that support clot retraction. Specifically, fibrinogens lacking Aalpha-chain RGD residues at 572-574 or lacking the gamma-chain residues AGDV 408-411 supported endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction as well as intact fibrinogen. Thus, clot retraction mediated by endothelial cells is not dependent on either of these sites. A variety of monoclonal antibodies against the integrin alphavbeta3 partially inhibited the endothelial cell-mediated retraction of clots formed from plasma fibrinogen. As expected, an antibody to the platelet integrin alphaIIbbeta3 did not inhibit endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction. These results indicate that this retraction is mediated at least in part by alphavbeta3. These results support the conclusion that (a) neither of the two fibrinogen cell binding sites described above is required to support clot retraction or that (b) either site alone or in conjunction with other fibrin(ogen) region(s) can support clot retraction. Thus, endothelial cell-mediated clot retraction appears to be dependent on fibrinogen cell binding sites other than those required to support adhesion of resting platelets to immobilized fibrinogen and platelet aggregation.

Although exact reasons for poor growth have not been established, increased calorie and protein needs and deficiencies in zinc, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and E may be factors. To determine whether inadequate nutrient intake contributes to this poor growth, we conducted a survey of the nutrition knowledge and practices of families affected by sickle cell disease. Sixty-one patients with a median age of 8 years (range, 13 months to 17 years) participated in the study. Patients with homozygous S hemoglobin (sickle cell) disease (Hb SS, n = 34) and sickle beta zero thalassemia (Hb S beta zero-thalassemia, n = 2) were combined; 19% were below the fifth percentile for height. The other patients, with sickle hemoglobin C disease (Hb SC, n = 21) and sickle beta plus thalassemia (Hb beta(+)-thalassemia, n = 4), were grouped, and 4% were below the fifth percentile for height (P = .043). Ninety percent of the study patients or their parents were familiar with the food groups indicated on the US Department of Agriculture's Food Guide Pyramid, but most patients failed to consume appropriate amounts from those groups. Although two thirds of the patients ate the recommended number of servings daily from the meat group, only 20% to 31% of the recommended servings from each of the other food groups was consumed. This was possibly related to low socioeconomic status. The patients in the Hb SS group ate significantly less from the bread (P < .037) and milk (P < .022) categories than the patients in the Hb SC group. Fifty-nine percent of families had incomes below the poverty level, and 79% participated in a food assistance program. We conclude that the nutrient intake of patients with sickle cell disease is often inadequate. Education for patients with sickle cell disease should focus on (1) specific nutrient needs, with proper distribution of dietary intake among the food groups, (2) ways to provide nutritious meals on a limited income, and (3) methods for increasing calorie and protein intake.

Title:Inhibition of brain interleukin-1 attenuates sleep rebound after sleep deprivation in rabbits.

Abstract:It is hypothesized that interleukin-1 (IL-1) is involved in physiological sleep. If this hypothesis is correct, inhibition of IL-1 should attenuate sleep responses after sleep deprivation. We tested the effect of intracerebroventricular or intravenous injection of an IL-1 inhibitor, an IL-1 receptor fragment (IL-1RF), on sleep rebound after sleep deprivation in rabbits. Six hours of total sleep deprivation significantly increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and enhanced electroencephalogram slow-wave activity during NREMS. Intracerebroventricular treatment with the IL-1RF (50 micrograms) significantly attenuated the sleep responses after sleep deprivation. Furthermore, 1.0 mg/kg i.v. injection of the IL-1RF significantly suppressed spontaneous NREMS in rabbits that were not sleep deprived. However, intravenous administration of the IL-1RF (1.0 mg/kg) failed to attenuate the sleep responses following the 6-h sleep deprivation period. These results support the hypothesis that central pools of IL-1 are important for physiological sleep regulation.

Abstract:The present study was an investigation of the effect of the method of mixing the constituents of CMW3 bone cement on selected physical and mechanical properties of the fully polymerized cement. Five such methods were used: hand mixing; "active" vacuum mixing; mixing in a machine that allowed simultaneous mechanical mixing and centrifugation; mixing using this machine followed by application of a "passive" vacuum; and application of a passive vacuum followed by mixing in the machine. It was found that the best overall results were obtained from cement that had been mixed using the second and fifth methods and the values of the properties were: density, 1220 to 1246 kg/m3; areal porosity, 0.02 to 7.04%; ultimate compressive strength, 84 to 112 MPa; ultimate compressive strain, 5.1 to 6.4%; and compressive modulus of elasticity, 2249 to 2877 MPa.

Title:Gender differences in the outcome of an unaided smoking cessation attempt.
Authors:['Ward KD', 'Klesges RC', 'Zbikowski SM', 'Bliss RE', 'Garvey AJ']

Abstract:There is conflicting evidence concerning gender differences in success at quitting smoking. Information is especially lacking regarding gender differences among unaided quitters who make up the vast majority of those attempting to quit. One hundred thirty-five smokers who made an unaided attempt at quitting were interviewed before quitting and were followed for 1 year after cessation. Relapse rates were extremely high both for men and women, with 62% of participants returning to regular smoking within 15 days after cessation. Women and men were equally likely to maintain short-term abstinence (through 15 days), but women were more than three times as likely to relapse subsequently. Nine percent of men, but no women, had biochemically verified sustained abstinence throughout the 1-year follow-up period. For both men and women, any smoking after the quit attempt inevitably led to full-blown relapse. Most participants resumed regular smoking within 24 hours after the first episode of smoking. Gender differences were observed for several variables related to smoking history, demographics, social support, perceived stress, and motivational factors, but these differences did not explain the increased risk of relapse for women. Our results clearly indicate that women are less likely than men to maintain long-term smoking abstinence following an unaided quit attempt, but reasons for this gender difference need further exploration.

Title:Chronic dieting and the belief that smoking controls body weight in a biracial, population-based adolescent sample.
Authors:['Klesges RC', 'Elliott VE', 'Robinson LA']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Tennessee, USA. bklesges@cc.memphis.edu
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of weight concerns and smoking for body weight reasons as a function of race and gender. DESIGN: A questionnaire measuring a number of factors thought to be predictive of smoking was administered. SETTING: The Memphis (Tennessee) school system. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 6961 seventh-grade students (mean age 13 years). This population consisted of 80.8% black children, 16.5% white children, and 2.7% of other ethnic origins. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight concerns were assessed using items from a restraint scale. Students were questioned regarding their smoking status, beliefs that smoking controls body weight, and their own weight-control smoking behaviour. RESULTS: Dietary restraint interacted with race in that, whereas white girls scored the highest on dietary restraint, black boys scored higher on dietary restraint than white boys. Almost 40% of subjects at this school level believed that smoking controls their body weight. Of the regular smokers, 12% indicated they have smoked to control their weight, with white girls endorsing this belief significantly more than other respondents. CONCLUSIONS: The propensity to smoke for weight control reasons, previously described by other researchers among white females of college and high-school age, was also found among this sample of students of junior high school age.

Abstract:We studied the impact of gross total resection on progression-free survival (PFS) and postoperative morbidity in 40 children with locally advanced medulloblastoma characterized by tumor invading the brain stem. These patients represented 40% of children treated for newly diagnosed medulloblastoma at a pediatric oncology center over a 10-year period. All patients underwent aggressive initial surgical resection. Review of surgical and neuroimaging findings documented gross total resection in 13 cases, near-total resection (< 1.5 cm2 residual tumor on imaging) in 14 cases, and subtotal resection (> than 50% resection with > or = 1.5 cm2 residual) in 13 cases. Overall, 85% of patients had a > 90% resection. Subsequent therapy comprised craniospinal irradiation in all cases and chemotherapy on institutional or cooperative group protocols in 35 cases. At a median follow-up of 4 years, postirradiation PFS is 61% (SE = 10%). There was no difference in PFS for patients who underwent gross total resection compared to those with any detectable residual tumor (p > 0.70). The posterior fossa syndrome occurred in 25% of cases, and had no apparent relationship to the extent of resection (p > 0.5, exact test). In this series, true gross total resection was not associated with a PFS advantage when compared to strictly defined near-total and subtotal resection. Although there was no operative mortality, the frequency of the posterior fossa syndrome is of concern and emphasizes the need for careful consideration of the risk/benefit ratio in the surgical approach to this subgroup of patients.

Title:Controlling false positive rates in prognostic factor analyses with small samples.
Authors:['Liu Q', 'Li Y', 'Boyett JM']
Affiliation:Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101, USA.
Abstract:Exploratory data analyses in medical research usually involve many potential risk factors. Typically, one performs numerous hypothesis tests to identify variables that are of prognostic value. Because of the multiplicity of tests, one must control the overall false positive rate. The Bonferroni adjustment is simple to use, but may be overly conservative when applied to correlated tests. We propose an exact adjustment method, based on the joint permutational distributions of the test statistics, in settings where the acquired sample size only allows analysis of a single feature at a time. We demonstrate our method with two examples.

Title:Stability of deslorelin injection.

Affiliation:Parenteral Medications Laboratory, University of Tennessee, College of Pharmacy, Memphis 38163, USA.
Abstract:The stability of deslorelin, a nonapeptide drug, in an injectable drug formulation was studied for 60 months. An HPLC analytical method was developed to quantify deslorelin and benzyl alcohol in deslorelin injection. The samples containing 500 micrograms/mL of deslorelin were stored at--10, 6, 25, 40 and 50 degrees C. No deslorelin degradation was observed in samples stored at 6 degrees C, but the loss of deslorelin in samples stored at 25, 40 and 50 degrees C was found to increase with temperature. The T90 of the product at 6 degrees C was estimated to be greater than 20 years from the short-term stability data of four lots stored at 25, 40 and 50 degrees C. The long-term stability results confirmed that there was no degradation of deslorelin stored at 6 degrees C for 5 years. Liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry analysis of aged samples showed hydrolysis of deslorelin and the production of a hexapeptide (< Ser-Tyr-D-Trp-Leu-Arg-Pro-NH-Et) with a molecular weight of 847. A second product resulted from the oxidation of the tryptophan indoylyl ring. The oxyindoyle decapeptide structure had an ion m/z of 1298. The mass spectrum of pure deslorelin also is reported.

Title:The contour test of loudness perception.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC', 'Taylor IM', 'Gray GA']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: This article presents the underlying rationale, normative data, and reliability data for a test of loudness perception (the Contour Test) that was devised for use in clinical hearing aid fitting. The Contour Test yields data describing the sound level required for each of seven categories of loudness ranging from very soft to uncomfortably loud. DESIGN: Two experiments are described. Experiment 1 yielded norms for the test. The subjects were 23 male and 22 female normal-hearing listeners. Test stimuli included warble tones at six frequencies and broad band speech. Experiment 2 assessed the reliability of the test results. Ten hearing-impaired listeners responded to the test at two frequencies on two occasions separated by several days. Both experiments also evaluated the effect of using different stimulus increment sizes on the measured levels of loudness categories. RESULTS: Based on the data from experiment 1, norms for each category of each stimulus are reported in terms of mean level and typical between-subject variation in responses. Data are provided in HA-12 cm3 coupler levels as well as in hearing levels (dB HL). The shape of the loudness growth function for warble tones was somewhat different from that for speech. When data were expressed in HL, there were no differences in mean loudness category levels across warble tone test frequencies. Thus, test frequencies were combined and equations were generated to describe the upper and lower limits of typical normal performance for warble tone stimuli. These equations can be used to construct a template for clinical comparison of normative values to patient loudness growth curves. Experiment 2 provided information about the test-retest variability of data yielded by the Contour Test. Reliability appears to be similar to that of the few other category scaling tests described in the literature. Most test-retest differences were 6 dB or less. Although a moderate variation in test increment size did not significantly affect the loudness category levels for young normal-hearing listeners, levels corresponding to loudness categories were significantly higher when larger increments were used with elderly hearing-impaired listeners. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this and other research indicates that standardized measurement of loudness perception is an achievable goal for clinical practice. The Contour Test appears to offer a viable approach to clinical measurement of loudness perception: It has good patient acceptance and combines fairly rapid administration with acceptable reliability. Details of test procedures and scoring sheets for manual administration can be downloaded from the Internet at www.ausp.memphis.edu/harl. However, it is important to keep in mind that the application of loudness perception data for narrowband stimuli (such as warble tones) to hearing aid prescription is complicated by the need to account for the effects of loudness summation across bandwidth. There is a need for additional research to establish an empirical link between clinically measured loudness perception and optimal amplification characteristics.

Title:Antitumor responses induced by transgenic expression of CD40 ligand.

Affiliation:Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cell and Gene Therapy Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.
Abstract:Because CD40 ligand (CD40L) is a co-stimulator molecule for multiple components of the immune response, we wanted to determine whether transgenic expression of the molecule would increase immune responses against a weakly immunogenic murine tumor, neuro-2a. Tumor cells were transduced with a retroviral construct containing the CD40L gene and co-injected with variable numbers of non-CD40L transduced cells into syngeneic mice. Mice injected with cells that expressed CD40L had a significant reduction in average tumor size as compared to controls (p < 0.0001). In addition, survival of the neuro-2a/CD40L mice was 48 days versus 34 days for the neuro-2a/neo controls (p < 0.02). Expression of CD40L by less than 1.5% of neuro-2a cells was sufficient for significant antitumor effects (p < 0.001). These antitumor effects protected mice from subsequent challenge with parental neuro-2a cells. The protective effects of CD40L were associated with systemic immunomodulation. In vivo depletion of CD8+ cells abrogated the CD40L-mediated antitumor effects. Analysis of spleens from CD40L-protected animals showed increased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, the majority of which co-expressed the activation marker CD25. In addition, an increased number of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) expressed the co-stimulatory molecule CD86. These experiments illustrate that transducing even a small percentage of tumor cells with CD40 ligand can create a long-lasting systemic immune response capable of impeding growth of unmodified neuroblastoma cells.

Title:Isolation of full-length RNA from a thermophilic cyanobacterium.
Authors:['Luo XZ', 'Stevens SE Jr']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:Isolation of full-length mRNA without degradation is critical in the study of in vivo gene regulation and transcription, cDNA synthesis and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. It is particularly difficult to isolate full-length mRNA from thermophiles, which have higher turnover rates of mRNA degradation. Mastigocladus laminosus is a thermophilic heterocystous cyanobacterium. The assay of M. laminosus cell lysates showed that RNase activity was high and was resistant to the conventional guanidine thiocyanate and 2-mercaptoethanol denaturation methods. The mRNA isolated by several conventional methods was completely degraded. A method was developed to purify full-length mRNA by a combination of fast cooling, vanadyl-ribonucleoside-complex inhibition, phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction, lithium chloride precipitation and the lysing of cells with the French Press. This method produced high-quality, full-length mRNA in high yield. Purified mRNA was suitable for Northern blotting, cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR. This method could be applicable to other thermophiles in which the RNase activity is high and/or is resistant to guanidine thiocyanate.

Abstract:The purpose of this investigation was to explore gender and ethnic differences in the prevalence of risk factors for smoking onset. As part of a larger study, 6,967 seventh graders completed a questionnaire measuring variables shown in previous research to predict cigarette smoking. The results indicated that at this age level, risk factors for smoking initiation are less prevalent among African Americans than European American youth and among girls relative to boys. These findings are consistent with the lower incidence of smoking among African Americans and girls at this young age. Future research should examine changes in risk factors over time to determine whether such changes accompany the rising smoking rate typically observed among girls and African Americans later in adolescence.

Title:Modeling the tensile behavior of human Achilles tendon.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Shaw KM']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152-6576, USA.
Abstract:Uniaxial quasi-static tensile stress, sigma versus strain, epsilon, data were obtained from 29 cadaveric Achilles tendons (donor ages: 36 to 100 years), at a strain rate of either 10 or 100%/s. These results were then used in modeling the elastic component of the tensile deformational behavior of this tissue. Two approaches were taken. In the first, it was shown that the following constitutive relation provided an excellent fit to the elastic section of the sigma-epsilon curve, sigma = C epsilon exp[D epsilon + F epsilon 2], with C, D and F being material constants, whose values for the present dataset were found to be C = 2.00 +/- 0.99, D = 0.089 +/- 0.087 and F = -0.0047 +/- 0.0095. The values of these coefficients were not statistically significantly affected by either donor age or test strain rate. In the second approach, the value of the modulus of elasticity of a filamentary polymer matrix composite material was computed as a function of various combinations of values of the modulus of elasticity of the fiber, the modulus of elasticity of the matrix, and angle of orientation of the principal material axes with respect to the reference coordinate axes (theta) for a fiber volume fraction of 0.6 and a material Poisson's ratio of 0.4. By comparing these results with the experimentally-obtained values of the tangent modulus of elasticity of the tendons (defined as the slope of the linear section of the post-toe zone in the sigma-epsilon plot), and assuming that the tendon may be idealized as a filamentary polymer matrix composite material, the suggestion is made that the winding angle of the fibers (collagen fibrils) in the tendon (taken to be equal to theta) is about 6 degrees.

Abstract:Positive-ion liquid secondary ionization mass spectrometry in combination with 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol as the liquid matrix was used to investigate the mass spectral features of a set of 21 N10-substituted derivatives of 2-chlorophenoxazine. The N-10 substitution included propyl, butyl and acetyl groups containing various secondary amines (N,N-diethylamine, N,N-diethanolamine, morpholine, piperidine, pyrrolidone or beta-hydroxyethylpiperazine) or a chloro group. These compounds are potent multi-drug resistance modulators. The molecular ions are observed as M+ and [M + H]+ ions. In general, the fragmentation pathways of these molecules are similar and very straightforward. The phenoxazine ring system remains stable under the Cs+ ion beam bombardment conditions, while fragmentations are observed along the length of the alkyl and acetyl side-chains. The fragmentation reactions were corroborated by acquiring product ion and constant neutral loss tandem mass spectrometric scans of the pertinent ions.

Title:Tensile properties of human tendo Achillis: effect of donor age and strain rate.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Shaw KM']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152-6576, USA. glewis@cc.memphis.edu
Abstract:Two sets of tensile tests were conducted on tendo Achillis taken from 16 embalmed cadavers (donor ages, 36 to 100 years). From the stress, sigma-versus-strain, epsilon results, values of the following properties were obtained: linear stiffness, ST (which is defined as the slope of the linear zone of the post-toe region of the load-versus-extension plot), ultimate tensile strength [UTS], the strain at the UTS point (herein called the ultimate tensile strain) [epsilon max], and the tangent modulus of elasticity, [ET] (which is the slope of the linear zone of the post-toe region of the sigma-epsilon curve). In the first set of tests, the loading rate was 10%/sec. The results are thus: linear stiffness: 685 +/- 262 N/mm.; UTS = 59 +/- 18 MPa; epsilon max = 22 +/- 7%; and ET = 375 +/- 102 MPa. It was found that donor age exerts an insignificant effect on linear stiffness, a marked effect on UTS, an insignificant effect on epsilon max, and a moderate effect on ET (Student's t-test; p < 0.05). In the second set of tests, the test tendons were taken from the cadavers of "middle-aged" donors (52 to 67 years), and the strain rate was 100%/sec. By combining the results of the first and second sets of tests for a subset of this group (i.e., those with matched counterparts), it was found that strain rate has a statistically significant effect on ST and ET but not on UTS and epsilon max (paired Student's t-test; p < 0.05). Based on all results and findings, donor age is suggested as one of the considerations when selecting tendo Achillis to be used as allografts for the repair of severely damaged or ruptured tendo Achillis or anterior cruciate ligament.

Abstract:In this paper, we develop a stochastic model for the interaction between CD4+ T cells and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virus by taking into account the basic biological mechanism as described in [1-4]. We studied this stochastic model through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that, in some cases, there is a positive probability that the virus will be eliminated by the process. We have also shown that, at the earlier stage of the infection, the probability distributions of the CD4+ T cells and free HIV are skewed; however, these distributions will eventually converge to the Gaussian distributions after several years. A real-data example is given to illustrate the application of our model.

Title:The major soluble tubulins are found in mega dalton (MDa) fractions in fully-grown oocytes and eggs but not in brain of the frog, Rana pipiens.

Abstract:During progesterone-induced oocyte maturation, the cell is converted from prophase I to metaphase II, which is known to involve microtubule changes. We hypothesize that progesterone affects the polymeric state of tubulins, isoform dynamics, as well as tubulin synthesis and degradation. To test the former, leopard frog (Rana pipiens) oocytes were treated with progesterone, homogenized and centrifuged at 16,000 x g. The resulting pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed using immunoblots probed with anti-alpha-tubulin antibody DM1A and anti-beta-tubulin antibody DM1B. The results indicate that the majority of tubulins are in supernatant fractions (soluble cellular component) and further indicate changes in size of pelletable tubulins with time post-progesterone treatment. To characterize the supernatant tubulins, Superose-6b columns were used to fractionate 16,000 x g supernatant materials. The results indicate tubulins in fractions of up to 5 MDa (equivalent in size to c. 50 tubulin dimers or 5,000 kDa) predominate, while tubulin dimers and monomers of 110 kDa and 55 kDa, respectively, are relatively minor components. The tubulin in MDa fraction pools in the oocyte soluble component seem to be tissue specific, since the reverse patterns were found in either frog brain or rat (Rattus norvegicus) brain tissue under the same conditions. Microtubule poisons, taxol and nocodazole, were used to test the dynamics of tubulin in MDa fractions and the results were opposite to that expected, i.e., taxol, a microtubule stabilizer, decreased tubulin in large MDa fractions while nocodazole, a microtubule destabilizer, increased it. Preliminary data also indicated that progesterone treatment alters the tubulin size classes (size-shift) in comparison with that in immature oocytes. These results, in combination with other research reports, suggest that tubulin in MDa fractions may either be associated with other cellular components or act as intermediates in microtubule dynamics, perhaps via oligomerization, during oocyte maturation and early development.

Title:Geometrical properties and torsional fatigue life of a tibial interlocking intramedullary nail segment.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Holland D']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152-6576, USA.
Abstract:OBJECTIVES: The first goal was to present details of a methodology for selecting the cross-sectional geometry and associated dimensions for a tibial interlocking intramedullary (i.m.) nail segment, given a set of candidate geometries. The second goal was to study the effect of four variables on the torsional fatigue life of specimens that constitute a segment of a tibial i.m. nail. METHODS: For the cross-sectional geometry study, the geometric element modeling and analysis method was used to obtain the areas (A) and moments of inertia (I and J) of each of the cross-sectional geometries in the set considered. In the fatigue tests, a specimen was subjected to a load at the end of a lever arm, through an actuator, at a fixed frequency. RESULTS: On the basis of the values of the A, I, and J and consideration of compatibility with the biological envelope, the hourglass cross-section geometry was selected as the best compromise. The cannulation, fillet radius, and main radius of this hourglass were determined to be 3.96, 1.02, and 4.06 millimeters, respectively. Fatigue test specimens fabricated from Ti-6Al-4V and having three sets of additional characteristics performed equally well as those fabricated from 316L stainless steel. These sets of characteristics are hourglass cross-section and mill annealed only; hourglass cross-section and mill annealed, followed by machining and anodization to give a gray coating; and cloverleaf cross-section and mill annealed, followed by machining and anodization to give a gray coating. CONCLUSION: Tibial IM nails with hourglass cross-sectional shape and fabricated of Ti-6Al-4V or Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy, having appropriate mechanical, thermal, and surface treatments, may be competitive with the current "gold standard" (namely cloverleaf cross-section and fabricated of 316L stainless steel in the cold-worked state).

Title:Multiple parameters for the comprehensive evaluation of the susceptibility of Escherichia coli to the silver ion.
Authors:['Zhao G', 'Stevens SE Jr']
Affiliation:Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The susceptibility of Escherichia coli B to the antibacterial activity of silver ions was measured in terms of the initial inhibitory concentration, complete inhibitory concentration, postagent effect for bacteriostatic susceptibility, minimum bactericidal concentration, maximum tolerant concentration, and log killing time for bactericidal activity. At a concentration of 9.45 microM and an inoculum size of 10(4-5) CFU ml-1, silver caused growth delay of E. coli; at a concentration of 18.90 microM, silver completely inhibited bacterial growth. Prolonged postagent effects ranged between 1.5 and 12 h at 0.75 x the initial inhibitory concentration, 1.0 x the initial inhibitory concentration, and 1.5 x the initial inhibitory concentration of the silver ion. One log-unit of viable bacterial population size was lost every 30 min at the minimum bactericidal concentration of the silver ion. Silver tolerance was determined as 20 times the initial inhibitory concentration with 48 h of exposure. This study presents an evaluative model as a reference for the quantitative analysis of the susceptibility of bacteria to silver ions.

Abstract:Interlocking intramedullary nailing is currently the leading method of treating a wide assortment of tibial fractures. Satisfactory clinical performance of such a nail is interwoven with the mechanical characteristics (chiefly, static strength, fatigue strength, fatigue life and stiffness) of the nail-contiguous fractured bone construct. The present work reviews the open literature on these nails and the mechanical performance of the constructs. Based on the observations made in the review, areas for future work are identified and expounded upon.

Title:Is smoking associated with lower body mass in adolescents? A large-scale biracial investigation.
Authors:['Klesges RC', 'Robinson LA', 'Zbikowski SM']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, TN, USA. bklesges@cc.memphis.edu
Abstract:The present investigation evaluated the relationship between smoking and body weight (body mass index [BMI]) in a large, biracial sample of seventh-grade students. Participants were 6751 (5,607 African American, 1,144 White) seventh-grade students participating in an evaluation of smoking determinants in adolescence. In addition to providing, in this survey design, information about their smoking status, participants self-reported both their height and weight, which was converted into a BMI. Contrary to predictions, smoking was positively related to BMI. That is, with increasing levels of smoking exposure, BMI significantly increased. Thus, it appears that smoking is not related to lowered BMI in adolescent populations. Implications and possible reasons for these findings are discussed.

Title:Solving the mystery of intermittent fluency breaks in a preschool child: chronic stuttering or normal fluency breaks?
Authors:['Manning WH']
Affiliation:School of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology, University of Memphis, TN, USA.
Abstract:The possibility of chronic stuttering is investigated in a preschool boy with a brief history of intermittent fluency breaks. The variability of the behavior adds to the mystery and makes the diagnosis of unusual or stuttering-like fluency breaks particularly difficult. Clues for solving this mystery are obtained from both the child and his parents. Verbal and nonverbal behaviors are considered, and the child's capacity for producing fluent speech is stressed during a formal evaluation to determine the effect of communicative demands. Detective work by the investigator takes the reader through a series of diagnostic decisions that eventually leads to cracking the case.

Title:Effects of interleukin-1 beta on sleep are mediated by the type I receptor.
Authors:['Fang J', 'Wang Y', 'Krueger JM']
Affiliation:Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163, USA.
Abstract:Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is a well characterized sleep regulatory substance. To study receptor mechanisms for the sleep-promoting effects of IL-1 beta, sleep patterns were determined in control and IL-1 type I receptor knockout (IL-1RI KO) mice with a B6x129 background after intraperitoneal injections of saline or murine recombinant IL-1 beta. The IL-1RI KO mice had slightly but significantly less sleep during the dark period compared with the controls. IL-1 beta dose dependently increased non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and suppressed rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) in the controls. The IL-1RI KO mice did not respond to IL-1 beta. In contrast, the IL-1RI KO mice increased NREMS and decreased REMS after administration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), another well characterized sleep-promoting substance. These results 1) provide further evidence that IL-1 beta is involved in sleep regulation, 2) indicate that the effects of IL-1 beta on sleep are mediated by the type I receptor, and 3) suggest that TNF-alpha is capable of inducing sleep without the involvement of IL-1.

Title:Cytokine rescue of p53-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest is mediated by distinct Jak kinase signaling pathways.

Abstract:Exposure of hematopoietic progenitors to gamma-irradiation (IR) induces p53-dependent apoptosis and a p53-independent G2/M cell cycle arrest. These responses to DNA-damage can be inhibited by treatment with cytokine growth factors. Here we report that gamma-IR-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest are suppressed by specific cytokines (e.g., erythropoietin and interleukin-3) and that activation of the Jak kinase is necessary and sufficient for these effects. Using myleoid cells expressing a series of erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) mutants, we have demonstrated that Jak kinase-dependent signals initiated from the membrane proximal domain of EpoR were sufficient to prevent IR-induced apoptotic cell death, but failed to prevent cell cycle arrest. Cell survival by Epo did not require activation of other known signaling pathways including PI-3 kinase, PLC-gamma, Ras or Stats. Signaling targets of Jak kinase pathways included members of the Bcl-2 family of anti-apoptotic proteins, and enforced expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL was as effective as cytokine treatment in blocking IR-induced apoptosis but did not prevent growth arrest. A distinct signal derived from a membrane distal domain of EpoR is required to overcome growth arrest associated with DNA damage. These findings functionally link the Jak signaling pathway to suppression of p53-mediated cell death by cytokines and demonstrate that the apoptotic and growth arrest responses to DNA damage in hematopoietic cells are modulated by distinct, cytokine specific signal transduction pathways.

Title:Accuracy of predicted ear canal speech levels using the VIOLA input/output-based fitting strategy.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Flamme GA']
Affiliation:University of Memphis, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Tennessee, USA.
Abstract:OBJECTIVE: The Visual Input/Output Locator Algorithm (VIOLA) is a software-assisted method for prescribing amplification targets and selecting a hearing aid to match the targets. Although the procedure calls for selection and fitting of hearing aids in terms of their pure-tone input/output functions in a coupler, it is assumed that a hearing aid that matches the coupler prescription targets will produce specific amplified speech levels in the patient's ear canal. This investigation evaluated the validity of that assumption. DESIGN: Six hearing aids were evaluated. They were representative of linear and compression processing as well as single- and 2-channel designs. The "subject" was a KEMAR manikin with realistic assumed hearing loss and loudness perception characteristics. Each hearing aid was configured to match the subject's VIOLA prescription as closely as possible. Predicted ear canal speech levels were determined using the prescription rules and modified by the differences between coupler prescription targets and coupler performance of the actual hearing aids. With the subject wearing each hearing aid coupled to an unvented earmold, continuous speech was presented in the sound field and measured, after amplification, in the ear canal. The match between observed and predicted levels of amplified speech indicated the validity of the VIOLA assumptions under examination. RESULTS: The match between predicted and observed levels was good for soft speech input levels. As speech input levels increased, the differences between observed and predicted levels also increased, with the largest differences seen for loud speech inputs. When differences were seen between observed and predicted levels, they were always in the direction of lower than predicted ear canal levels. The differences between observed and predicted levels were attributed to the effects of limiting, effects of compression ratio in wide range compression, the individual subject's field-to-microphone transfer function, and the subject's individual real-ear-to-coupler level difference. CONCLUSIONS: Ear canal speech levels were reasonably close to predicted values, and the deviations from predicted levels were plausibly accounted for by consideration of hearing aid performance. Thus, the approach used by the VIOLA procedure holds considerable promise for extending clinical control over the complex and interactive parameters of nonlinear hearing aids. The results of this study indicate that selection and fitting of hearing aids using the current VIOLA procedure usually will result in the generation of lower than predicted ear canal speech levels, especially for loud speech inputs. However, the accuracy of the procedure could be improved substantially by modification of the software to account for the effects of limiting and those of the compression ratio in systems with compression thresholds lower than the level of unamplified loud speech.

Abstract:OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of different cognitive orientations focused on social comparison or self-comparison, followed by success or failure feedback, on mood, task persistence, and task difficulty choice in children with cancer. METHOD: Children with cancer (N = 79) and a group of age-matched controls (N = 72 were randomly assigned in a 2 (Achievement Orientation) x 2 (Feedback) between-subjects design. RESULTS: Between-group differences revealed that children with cancer chose more difficult tasks for the future than those in the comparison group, while the comparison subjects chose to persist longer with the problems than did children with cancer, with no significant differences on measures of mood. CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of achievement orientation as a clinical manipulation may not be as robust as expected with a medically ill population, due to the apparent stability of achievement orientations.

Affiliation:The University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA. g.mittleman@mail.psyc.memphis.edu
Abstract:Structural abnormalities in the hippocampal formation and overactive dopamine neurotransmission in the ventral striatum are thought to be key pathologies in schizophrenia. This experiment examined the functional contribution of different hippocampal subfields to locomotion elicited by D-amphetamine (0.32-3.2 mg/kg) and the direct agonists quinpirole (0.025-0.5 mg/kg) and SKF 38393 (2.5-15.0 mg/kg). Male rats served as unoperated controls or received one of six different lesions (hippocampal formation, fimbria-fornix, subiculum, CA3-4, entorhinal cortex or dentate gyrus (DG)). The main results indicated that extensive ibotenic acid-induced lesions of the hippocampal formation, or colchicine-induced lesions of the DG enhanced locomotion elicited by the D2 agonist quinpirole. Electrolytic lesions of the fimbria-fornix, in comparison, had much larger effects and resulted in increases in the locomotor response to amphetamine and quinpirole. These results extend previous demonstrations of hippocampal modulation of the ventral striatum by showing that this modulatory influence is dependent on both the location and total extent of cell loss within the hippocampal formation. The results are discussed in relation to the causes of and neurophysiological mechanisms involved in enhanced drug-induced locomotion and in terms of their implications for mental diseases including schizophrenia.

Title:Peptide LSARLAF activates alpha(IIb)beta3 on resting platelets and causes resting platelet aggregate formation without platelet shape change.
Authors:['Derrick JM', 'Loudon RG', 'Gartner TK']
Affiliation:Microbiology and Molecular Cell Sciences, University of Memphis, TN 38152-6041, USA.
Abstract:Adhesion of resting platelets to fibrinogen was enhanced by a peptide which was designed to bind near the presumptive fibrinogen gamma-chain binding site of the alpha subunit of the integrin alpha(IIb)beta3. This peptide, but not a scrambled control peptide, induced adhesion of resting platelets to fibronectin, vitronectin, von Willebrand factor, and monovalent (lacks one functional gamma-chain) fibrinogen. Resting platelets not treated with the agonist peptide did not adhere to these ligands. Agonist peptide induced adhesion of resting platelets to Fg was not secretion dependent and was inhibited by the monoclonal antibody 7E3. The agonist peptide caused aggregation of resting platelets on resting platelets adherent to immobilized Fg without causing platelet shape change. Therefore, the agonist peptide may activate alpha(IIb)beta3 by directly inducing a conformation change in the receptor on resting platelets.

Title:Verification of statements about story worlds that deviate from normal conceptions of time: what is true about Einstein's Dreams?

Affiliation:Department of Psychology, University of Memphis, TN 38152-6400, USA. a-graesser@memphis.edu
Abstract:College students read chapters from a novel written by Alan Lightman (Einstein's Dreams) and later provided verification judgments on the truth/falsity of test statements. Each chapter described a different fictional village that incorporated assumptions about time that deviate from our normal TIME schema, e.g., citizens knowing exactly when the world will end, time flowing backward instead of forward. These novel assumptions about time provided interesting insights about life and reality. In two experiments, we examined whether readers could accurately incorporate these novel assumptions about time in the fictional story worlds, as manifested in the verification judgments for statements after story comprehension. The test statements included verbatim typical, verbatim atypical, inference typical, and inference atypical information from the perspective of mundane reality that meshes with a normal TIME schema. Verification ratings were collected on a 6-point scale in Experiment 1, whereas Experiment 2 used a signal-response technique in which binary true/false decisions were extracted at-.5, 1.5, 3.5, 5.5, and 10.0 s. The college students were measured on literary expertise, reading skill, working memory span, and reading time. Readers with comparatively high literary expertise showed truth discrimination scores that were compatible with a schema copy plus tag model, which assumes that readers are good at detecting and remembering atypical verbatim information; this model predicts better (and faster) truth discrimination for verbatim atypical statements than for verbatim typical statements. In contrast, fast readers with comparatively low literary expertise were compatible with a filtering model; this model predicts that readers gloss over (or suppress) atypical verbatim information and show advantages for verbatim typical information. All groups of readers had trouble inferentially propagating the novel assumptions about time in a fictional story world, but the slower readers were more accurate in their verification of the atypical inferences. A construction-integration model could explain the interactions among literary expertise, reading time, and the typicality of test statements.

Affiliation:Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.
Abstract:Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most common genetic alteration in human cancer, and tumors that express mutant p53 may be more aggressive and have a worse prognosis than p53-null cancers. Mutant p53 enhances tumorigenicity in the absence of a transdominant negative mechanism, and this tumor-promoting activity correlates with its ability to transactivate reporter genes in transient transfection assays. However, the mechanism by which mutant p53 functions in transactivation and its endogenous cellular targets that promote tumorigenicity are unknown. Here we report that (i) mutant p53 can regulate the expression of the endogenous c-myc gene and is a potent activator of the c-myc promoter; (ii) the region of mutant p53 responsiveness in the c-myc gene has been mapped to the 3' end of exon 1; (iii) the mutant p53 response region is position and orientation dependent and therefore does not function as an enhancer; and (iv) transactivation by mutant p53 requires the C terminus, which is not essential for wild-type p53 transactivation. These data suggest that it may be possible to selectively inhibit mutant p53 gain of function and consequently reduce the tumorigenic potential of cancer cells. A possible mechanism for transactivation of the c-myc gene by mutant p53 is proposed.

Abstract:The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which the state of the surface of newly placed restorations made of one of two commercial formulations of composite resin (Pertac-Hybrid and Z-100) affects the interfacial bond strength when such restorations are immediately repaired with the same resin. Three groups of specimens for each material were prepared: one group in which there was an air-inhibited film on the surface of the initial layer of the restoration, another in which that film was prevented from being formed, and a third in which that surface was abraded prior to placement of the repair layer. All specimens were stored for 6 weeks in water at 23 degrees C before being loaded to fracture in shear at a rate of 5 mm/min. The shear bond strength results were treated using the three-parameter Weibull equation and a clearly defined index of performance (I), which is a measure of both the magnitude and variability of the shear bond strength. It was found that, for two states of the surface of the initial layer, I for Pertac-Hybrid specimens is about the same as that for Z-100 specimens. For specimens made of either material, there was a demonstrable difference in I between specimens with or without an air-inhibited film on the initial layer, while abrading the surface of that layer severely degraded I.

Abstract:The focus of this work was a delineation of the effect of the method of sterilization (gamma-irradiation versus exposure to ethylene oxide (EtO) gas) of the powder constituents of Palacos R bone cement on the molecular weight, quasi-static tensile and compressive properties and fatigue performance of the fully polymerized material. It was found that the quasi-static properties are not noticeably affected. However, when the powder constituents were gamma-sterilized, both the molecular weight and the fatigue performance of the cement are significantly lower compared to when the constituents are EtO-sterilized. Explanations are offered for these findings, and recommendations are submitted regarding the preferred method of sterilization of bone cement and reporting of studies in which different formulations of cement are compared.

Title:The apparent fracture toughness of acrylic bone cement: effect of three variables.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Nyman J', 'Trieu HH']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:In cemented arthroplasties, pores are almost invariably present at one or more of the so-called 'weak-link' zones (namely, the bone-cement interface, the cement mantle and the cement-implant interface). In the clinical milieu, arthroplasties are frequently subjected to cyclical loading. These conditions underscore the significance of the apparent fracture toughness (KISR) of the cement. The present work is an investigation of the effect of three variables on KISR of three commercial formulations of bone cement (namely, CMW3, PalacosR and Osteopal) measured using straight-sided chevron notched short rod specimens. For CMW3, the effect of mixing method was studied, with all cement constituents having been stored at ambient laboratory environment prior to being mixed. The highest KISR was obtained from material that was obtained from exposing the cement constituents to a passive vacuum for 20 s and then mixing them in a machine that subjected them to simultaneous mechanical mixing and centrifugation. For Palacos R, the effects of two variables [storage temperature of the cement constituents prior to being mixed (4 degrees C versus 21 degrees C) and mixing method (hand mixing versus vacuum mixing)] (taken individually) were studied. It was found that only mixing method exerts a significant effect on KISR. When room-temperature stored constituents were vacuum mixed, the KISR values for a low-viscosity cement (Osteopal) and a medium-viscosity cement of very similar composition (Palacos R) are not significantly different, indicating that the fracture resistance of bone cement is influenced more by its composition than its viscosity.

Title:Synthesis and adenosine receptor affinity of 7-beta-D-ribofuranosylxanthine.
Authors:['Bridson PK', 'Lin X', 'Melman N', 'Ji XD', 'Jacobson KA']
Affiliation:Chemistry Department, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:7-beta-D-Ribofuranosylxanthine, a previously unreported isomer of xanthosine, was prepared in four steps from 7-benzylxanthine. The procedure, which involves the use of pivaloyloxymethyl groups to protect the xanthine ring, was also applied to preparation of some 1-N-alkyl derivatives of 7-ribosylxanthine. Adenosine receptor affinity for these compounds was determined. 7-beta-D-Ribofuranosylxanthine was found to have higher affinity and greater selectivity for the A1 receptor than previously reported xanthine nucleosides, and to be a partial agonist.

Title:Effect of material property representation on stresses in endoprostheses.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Jonathan V', 'Kambhampati S']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA.
Abstract:The present study sought to examine if, and to what extent, the representation of the elastic properties of material(s) in a model of an endoprosthesis per se or a construct that includes an endoprosthesis affects the stresses in the model, when the finite element analysis method is used to obtain these stresses. For this purpose, two models were examined. One was of an elastomeric metacarpophalangeal joint implant, with the material being assumed to have isotropic elastic properties in one case while it was represented as hyperelastic in the other. The model used in the second study case was that of a construct comprising the tibial component of a total knee replacement, the associated tibial insert, the resected bones, and the acrylic bone cement layer. In one analysis of this model, all the materials were taken to have isotropic elastic properties, while in the other analysis, the cortical bone was represented as transversely isotropic, with all other materials being considered to have isotropic elastic properties. The result show that, in both study cases considered, there is a strong effect of the representation of the elastic properties of material(s) on the stresses in the models.

Title:Cellular localization domains of a rabbit and a human carboxylesterase: influence on irinotecan (CPT-11) metabolism by the rabbit enzyme.
Authors:['Potter PM', 'Wolverton JS', 'Morton CL', 'Wierdl M', 'Danks MK']
Affiliation:Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.
Abstract:Enzyme activation of prodrugs to improve the therapeutic index of specific anticancer agents is an attractive alternative to current chemotherapy regimens. This study addresses the potential for activating irinotecan (CPT-11) with recombinant carboxylesterases (CEs). CEs are a ubiquitous class of enzymes thought to be involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics. Their primary amino acid sequence indicates that these proteins should be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. By PCR-mediated mutagenesis of a rabbit liver and a human alveolar macrophage CE cDNA, expression in Cos7 cells, and subsequent immunohistochemical localization, we have determined that an 18-amino acid NH2-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide is responsible for the localization of these proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum. By similar approaches, we have demonstrated that the COOH-terminal amino acids HIEL prevent secretion of the proteins from the cell. Enzymatic activity was lost by removing the NH2-terminal domain; however, active enzyme could be detected in the culture media of cells expressing the COOH-terminally truncated proteins. Secretion of CEs lacking the six COOH-terminal amino acids could be prevented with brefeldin A, confirming that these truncated enzymes were processed and released from cells by endoplasmic reticulum-mediated exocytosis. Double-truncation mutant enzymes lacking both NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences demonstrated immunostaining patterns similar to those of the NH2-terminally truncated proteins and also lacked CE activity. In all cases, metabolism of the classic esterase substrate o-nitrophenyl acetate predicted the sensitivity of cells expressing the rabbit CE to the anticancer agent CPT-11. In addition, the secreted enzyme sensitized Cos7 cells to this drug, indicating that protein association with a lipid bilayer is not required for substrate metabolism.

Title:The evolution of the auditory midlatency response in evaluating unconscious memory formation during general anesthesia.
Authors:['Smith TL', 'Zapala D']
Affiliation:University of Tennessee, Memphis, USA.
Abstract:The inability to objectively evaluate the amnesic status of an anesthetized patient has been a perplexing problem for the anesthesia provider. One approach thought to be effective in evaluating the amnesic status of the anesthetized patient is the auditory midlatency response (AMLR). The AMLR is an electrophysiological response that is recorded from scalp electrodes 10 to 80 ms after the auditory pathways begin to process acoustic stimuli. The response is thought to reflect the anesthetized patient's ability to consolidate an acoustic stimuli into an explicit or implicit memory. This article defines the amnesic state, describes the various components of AMLR, discusses clinical uses of the AMLR as an indicator of memory formation during the anesthetized state, and explains the clinical implications of using the AMLR in the surgical suite. Recent results have noted that the Pa waveform, the first positive deflection of the AMLR, may be the component that may serve as an intraoperative indicator of the anesthetized patient's ability to potentially consolidate an intraoperative acoustic stimuli into a memory. With the establishment of the Pa waveform of the AMLR as a reliable indicator of intraoperative memory formation, the AMLR can then be used to significantly decrease the occurrences of traumatic neurosis in the surgical patient and subsequent medicolegal consequences for the health care team. Thus, the use of the AMLR strives to promote a safer intraoperative environment for both the patient and the anesthesia provider.

Title:A state space model for the HIV epidemic in homosexual populations and some applications.
Authors:['Tan WY', 'Xiang Z']
Affiliation:Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Memphis, TN 38152, USA. tanwy@msuvxl.memst.edu
Abstract:In this paper we have developed a state space model for the HIV epidemic in homosexual populations which have been divided into subpopulations according to sexual activity levels. In this model, the stochastic dynamic system model is the stochastic model of the HIV epidemic in terms of the chain multinomial model whereas the observation model is a statistical model based on the observed AIDS incidences. This model is applied to the San Francisco homosexual population for estimating the numbers of susceptible people, infective people and AIDS cases and for estimating the probabilities of HIV transmission from infective people to susceptible people given sexual contacts. The results show that the estimated numbers of AIDS incidence trace closely the observed numbers indicating the usefulness of the model. It is observed that the estimated numbers of latent people show multimodal curves and that HIV infection takes place during the primary stage and very late stage. The results have further shown that there are significant differences between the observed AIDS incidences and the estimates by the embedded deterministic model. These results indicate that using the embedded deterministic model to estimate the HIV-infected people and to predict future AIDS cases can be very misleading in some cases.

Title:Dynamic thermomechanical properties and crystallinity of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene tibial inserts.
Authors:['Lewis G', 'Rogers C', 'Trieu HH']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, Tennessee, USA. glewis@cc.memphis.edu
Abstract:A dynamic thermomechanical analysis method was used to determine the values of the viscoelastic parameters, storage modulus (E') and the tangent of the loss angle (tan delta) of samples taken from the near surface and core regions of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) bar stock specimens that had been aged in ambient laboratory air for 12 months (the control group) and UHMWPE tibial inserts that had been subjected to the following treatments: gamma sterilization followed by shelf aging in ambient laboratory air for between 56 and 112 months or ethylene oxide (EtO) gas sterilization followed by shelf aging in ambient laboratory air for 73 months. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine the melt temperature and percentage crystallinity (%C) of these samples. There were three main findings. First, EtO sterilization produced no statistically significant effect on the values of E' or tan delta (relative to those for the control group), but the values of these parameters were markedly affected by gamma sterilization. Second, for gamma-irradiated samples, E' increased with an increase in the shelf aging time. Third, there was a strong direct association between E' and % C. The various potential uses of this association are described, paying special attention to its likely role in predicting the in vivo wear of UHMWPE tibial inserts.

Abstract:Evidence indicates that middle-aged smokers weigh less than nonsmokers and that smoking cessation reliably produces weight gain, but recent studies have questioned the weight control "benefits" of smoking in younger populations (the time that people typically initiate smoking). The relationship between smoking and body weight was evaluated in all U.S. Air Force Basic Military Training recruits during a 1-year period (n = 32,144). Those who smoked prior to Basic Military Training (n = 10,440) were compared to never smokers or experimental smokers. Results indicated that regular-current smoking had no relationship to body weight in women (p > .05) and a very small effect in men (p < .05). Ethnicity, education, income, and duration and intensity of smoking did not affect the relationship between smoking and body weight. It was concluded that smoking has no effects on the body weights of young women and minimal effects in young men.

Title:Bax is an important determinant of chemosensitivity in pediatric tumor cell lines independent of Bcl-2 expression and p53 status.

Abstract:Susceptibility of a tumor cell to undergo chemotherapy-induced apoptosis appears to be dependent upon the balance of proapoptotic and survival factors that are expressed within any given cell. We have chosen to evaluate how expression of several of these proteins influences chemosensitivity of a panel of 10 pediatric tumor cell lines chosen from three tumor histiotypes: neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and pediatric glial tumors. The proteins evaluated were p53 and six members of the Bax/Bcl-2 family: three proapoptotic proteins (Bax, Bak, and Bcl-xS) and three survival factors (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1). We investigated whether there was any relationship between endogenous expression of these proteins and chemosensitivity (or resistance) to three chemotherapeutic agents that directly damage DNA (doxorubicin, actinomycin D, and topotecan) and a mitotic spindle poison (vincristine). Even though exogenous overexpression of wild-type p53 has been associated with a chemosensitive phenotype in several model systems we demonstrated no such relationship in these studies. In addition, expression levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-xS, Bak, or Mcl-1 did not correlate with sensitivity or resistance to the four drugs. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between endogenous levels of Bax protein and sensitivity to both doxorubicin and actinomycin D. We conclude that even though many proteins such as p53 and Bcl-2 have been shown to influence drug response when exogenously overexpressed in model systems, in unmodified cell lines endogenous protein levels may not generate the same results. We have demonstrated that endogenous Bax expression was the only protein found to be associated with chemosensitivity across the three different tumor histiotypes and propose that analysis of Bax may be a more useful prognostic indicator for tumor response to therapy than either p53 or Bcl-2.

Abstract:Inherited deficiency of the CD40 ligand (X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome) is characterized by failure of immunoglobulin isotype switching and severe defects of cell-mediated immunity. To test the potential for gene transfer therapy to correct this disorder, we transduced murine bone marrow or thymic cells with a retroviral vector containing the cDNA for the murine CD40 ligand (CD40L) and injected them into CD40L-/- mice. Even low-level, constitutive expression of the transgene stimulated humoral and cellular immune functions in these mice. With extended follow-up, however, 12 of 19 treated mice developed T-lymphoproliferative disorders, ranging from polyclonal increases of lymphoblasts to overt monoclonal T-lymphoblastic lymphomas that involved multiple organs. Our findings show that constitutive (rather than tightly regulated), low-level expression of CD40L can produce abnormal proliferative responses in developing T lymphocytes, apparently through aberrant interaction between CD40L+ and TCRalphabeta+CD40+ thymocytes. Current methods of gene therapy may prove inappropriate for disorders involving highly regulated genes in essential positions in proliferative cascades.

Abstract:The efficacy of the topoisomerase I inhibitor 7-ethyl-10-(4-[1-piperidino]-1-piperidino)-carbonyloxy-camptotheci n (irinotecan, CPT-11) has been examined against a panel of six independently derived neuroblastoma xenografts. Intensive courses of therapy, where irinotecan was administered i.v. daily 5 days per week for two consecutive weeks [(dx5)2; defined as 1 cycle], were compared to more protracted low-dose schedules where cycles were repeated every 21 days for a total of three courses inverted question markabbreviated [(dx5)2]3 inverted question mark. When administered (dx5)2 for a single cycle, the maximum tolerated daily dose was 40 mg/kg. Irinotecan induced a high frequency of complete regressions (CRs) in four of the six lines examined; however, most tumors achieving CR regrew during the period of observation (12 weeks). Furthermore, there was no advantage in high-dose regimens as compared to low dose (10 mg/kg) on the same schedule. Protracted schedules of administration, where three courses of therapy were given at 21-day intervals inverted question mark[(dx5)2]3 inverted question mark i.v. were examined at 10 and 5 mg/kg/dose. Even at the lower dose level, irinotecan caused 100% CR in all tumor lines that were maintained at 12 weeks. To determine the minimum dose levels required to induce objective regressions of neuroblastoma xenografts, decreasing doses were examined using the [(dx5)2]3 i.v. schedule. At 2.5 mg/kg/dose, >90% of NB-1643, NB-1691, NB-1382.2, and NB-EB xenografts demonstrated CR, whereas at 1.25 mg/kg/dose, all six tumor lines evaluated demonstrated objective regressions (>/=50% volume reduction), with a high frequency of CRs in four tumor lines. The 10-hydroxy-7-ethyl CPT lactone single-day systemic exposure measured with the minimum dose (2.5 mg/kg) associated with complete response was 198, 257, and 228 ng.h/ml for mice bearing NB-1643, NB-1691, and NB-EB tumors, respectively. These results indicate that childhood neuroblastoma xenografts are highly sensitive to irinotecan given by parenteral administration, and that efficacy is schedule dependent.

Abstract:Irinotecan [7-ethyl-10-(4-[1-piperidino]-1-piperidino)-carbonyloxy-camptothec in] administered i.v. in two courses, each course consisting of administration every day for 5 days [(dx5)2] on days 1-5 and 8-12, has demonstrated significant activity against advanced human tumor xenografts derived from colon adenocarcinomas and several childhood cancers. To build on this therapy, we have evaluated the combination of irinotecan given on this schedule with 5-fluorouracil given on days 1, 7, and 14 with or without leucovorin [(dx5)3 i.v.] against colon tumors, or combined with etoposide administered (dx5)2 i.v. either 2 h before or 2 h after irinotecan for treatment of colon tumors and rhabdomyosarcomas. A combination of 5-fluorouracil at 75% and irinotecan at 50% of their respective maximum tolerated doses when administered as single agents on this schedule gave acceptable toxicity. Against colon adenocarcinoma xenografts, 5-fluorouracil did not enhance the response rate compared with that obtained with the optimum dose of irinotecan given as a single agent. Against GC3/TK- xenografts, which lack thymidine kinase and cannot salvage thymidine to circumvent the inhibition of thymidylate synthase, the addition of leucovorin to the combination increased the complete response rate from 10 to >90%, whereas the response rates for the optimal doses of irinotecan or 5-fluorouracil, as single agents, were 30 and <10%, respectively. Etoposide d x 5 i.v. for two or three courses or (d x 5)3 p.o. did not cause objective regression of any colon tumors. In contrast, three of five rhabdomyosarcoma lines demonstrated a high frequency of partial regressions or complete regressions when treated (d x 5)1 i.v. Repetitive courses [e.g., (d x 5)2 or (d x 5)3] i.v. or p.o. or by 4-h infusion d x3 i.v. were either equally effective or less effective. Irinotecan and etoposide were combined using the (d x 5)2 i.v. schedule for both drugs, in which irinotecan was given 2 h before or 2 h after the administration of etoposide. Each drug could be combined at only 38% of its respective maximum tolerated dose when administered as a single agent, indicating greater than additive toxicity. Toxicity was similar irrespective of the sequence of administration and was manifested by loss of weight (73% of the initial weight, nadir day 7), myelosuppression, and prolonged thrombocytopenia. The responses of colon carcinomas to the combination given in either sequence were similar to that achieved with irinotecan given alone at the same dose as used in the combination. Similarly, when etoposide was given before irinotecan, the responses of rhabdomyosarcomas were similar to those for irinotecan. However, in experiments in which etoposide was administered 2 h after each dose of irinotecan, there was significant antagonism of the antitumor activity of irinotecan.

Title:Contact stress at articular surfaces in total joint replacements. Part I: experimental methods.
Authors:['Lewis G']
Affiliation:Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Memphis, TN 38152-6576, USA.
Abstract:It is now widely accepted that both the design and the operating conditions at articular surfaces in total joint replacements influence the magnitude of the contact stress at those surfaces. In turn, such stress plays a pivotal role in the clinical performance of the prosthesis. Hence, a plethora of methods have been used by many workers not only to determine or estimate this stress but also to identify the main influencing factors. This literature is critically reviewed in the present study, which is in two parts. In this first part, the focus is on experimental methods. Two main recommendations emerge from this review. First, the pressure-sensitive film should be used. Second, more work is needed in many areas, an example of which is the effect of the method of sterilization of tibial inserts on the contact stress at the tibiofemoral interface in knee implants.

Abstract:This study examined the relationship between smoking status and weight change from baseline to Year 7 in a large biracial cohort, the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study. Unadjusted for covariates, only male smokers weighed less than nonsmokers, with no effect among women. Adjusted for covariates, male and female smokers weighed less than nonsmokers at baseline, adjusted for age, total energy intake, alcohol intake, and physical fitness. Over the 7-year follow-up, all smoking status groups gained weight, including continuous smokers and initiators. Weight gain was greatest among those who quit smoking. Weight gain attributable to smoking cessation was 4.2 kg for Whites and 6.6 kg for Blacks. Smoking had a small weight-attenuating effect on Blacks. No such effects, however, were observed among Whites. These results suggest, at least in younger smokers, that smoking has minimal impact on body weight.

Abstract:Decreasing speed of foot movement is a serious perceptual-motor impairment for older individuals such as in walking and driving. The present study examined the relationship between age and psychomotor performance for upper vs lower extremities. A visual stimulus was used to measure the speed of finger and foot movement responses, i.e., choice reaction time and total response time. 32 healthy persons, ranging in age from 9 to 75 years, were divided into three groups: ages 9-10, ages 20-30, and age 60 and above. A 3 (age group) x 2 (test: finger vs foot) two-way analysis of variance on converted Z scores indicated a significant effect on age group and an interaction between test and age group. While the elderly group showed poorest over-all performance, their lower extremity response was identified to be relatively slower than their upper-extremity response.

Title:Apparent fracture toughness of acrylic bone cement: effect of test specimen configuration and sterilization method.

Abstract:The plane strain fracture toughness of Palacos R bone cement was determined using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) principles and three different test specimen configurations: single edge notched three-point (SENB), rectangular compact tension (RCT), and chevron notched short rod (CNSR). Another aspect of the study was an investigation of the effect of three methods used to sterilize the powder constituents of the cement-none, gamma irradiation and ethylene oxide--on the fracture toughness of the fully polymerized material. A detailed justification is provided for using LEFM. The fracture toughness results obtained using the CNSR specimens were, on average, 14 and 16% higher than those obtained using the SENB and RCT types, respectively. These differences are accounted for in terms of differences in four aspects of these specimen configuration (namely, residual stress effects, loading rate, material inhomogeneity, and the nature of the test). For a given specimen configuration, gamma irradiation produced a statistically significant decrease in fracture toughness which, it is suggested, is due to the concomitant depreciation in molecular weight. For a given cement type, there is no statistically significant difference in fracture toughness results obtained using SENB and RCT specimens. It is thus suggested that either of these configurations can be used to determine the fracture toughness of acrylic bone cement.

Title:Personality and the subjective assessment of hearing aids.
Authors:['Cox RM', 'Alexander GC', 'Gray G']

Abstract:Relatively little is known about the influence of patients' personality features on the responses they make to self-assessment items used to measure the outcome of a hearing aid fitting. If the personality of the hearing aid wearer has a significant influence on self-report outcome data, it would be important to explore the relevant personality variables and to be cognizant of their effects when using subjective outcome data to justify decisions about clinical services or other matters. This investigation explored the relationship between several personality attributes and responses to the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB). It found that more extroverted patients tend to report more hearing aid benefit in all speech communication situations. In addition, patients with a more external locus of control tend to have more negative reactions to loud environmental sounds, both with and without amplification. Anxiety also played a small additional role in determining APHAB responses. Although personality variables were found to explain a relatively small amount of the variance in APHAB responses (usually around 10%), these outcomes should alert practitioners and researchers to the potential effects of personality variables in all self-report data.
